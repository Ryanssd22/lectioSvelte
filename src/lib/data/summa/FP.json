        "question": "Whether, besides philosophy, any further doctrine is required?",
        "OB1": "It seems that, besides philosophical science, we have no need of \nany further knowledge. For man should not seek to know what is above \nreason: \"Seek not the things that are too high for thee\" (Ecclus. 3:22). \nBut whatever is not above reason is fully treated of in philosophical \nscience. Therefore any other knowledge besides philosophical science is \nsuperfluous.",
        "OB2": "Further, knowledge can be concerned only with being, for nothing \ncan be known, save what is true; and all that is, is true. But everything \nthat is, is treated of in philosophical science---even God Himself; so \nthat there is a part of philosophy called theology, or the divine \nscience, as Aristotle has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore, besides \nphilosophical science, there is no need of any further knowledge.",
        "CON": "It is written (2 Tim. 3:16): \"All Scripture, inspired \nof God is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in \njustice.\" Now Scripture, inspired of God, is no part of philosophical \nscience, which has been built up by human reason. Therefore it is useful \nthat besides philosophical science, there should be other knowledge, i.e. \ninspired of God.",
        "ANS": "It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be \na knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by \nhuman reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an \nend that surpasses the grasp of his reason: \"The eye hath not seen, O \nGod, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for \nThee\" (Is. 66:4). But the end must first be known by men who are to \ndirect their thoughts and actions to the end. Hence it was necessary for \nthe salvation of man that certain truths which exceed human reason should \nbe made known to him by divine revelation. Even as regards those truths \nabout God which human reason could have discovered, it was necessary that \nman should be taught by a divine revelation; because the truth about God \nsuch as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and that \nafter a long time, and with the admixture of many errors. Whereas man's \nwhole salvation, which is in God, depends upon the knowledge of this \ntruth. Therefore, in order that the salvation of men might be brought \nabout more fitly and more surely, it was  necessary that they should be \ntaught divine truths by divine revelation. It was therefore necessary \nthat besides philosophical science built up by reason, there should be a \nsacred science learned through revelation.",
        "RP1": "Although those things which are beyond man's knowledge may \nnot be sought for by man through his reason, nevertheless, once they are \nrevealed by God, they must be accepted by faith. Hence the sacred text \ncontinues, \"For many things are shown to thee above the understanding of \nman\" (Ecclus. 3:25). And in this, the sacred science consists.",
        "RP2": "Sciences are differentiated according to the various means \nthrough which knowledge is obtained. For the astronomer and the physicist \nboth may prove the same conclusion: that the earth, for instance, is \nround: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e. abstracting from \nmatter), but the physicist by means of matter itself. Hence there is no \nreason why those things which may be learned from philosophical science, \nso far as they can be known by natural reason, may not also be taught us \nby another science so far as they fall within revelation. Hence theology \nincluded in sacred doctrine differs in kind from that theology which is \npart of philosophy."

Therefore \nsacred doctrine is not a science.",

There are some which proceed from a \nprinciple known by the natural light of intelligence, such as arithmetic \nand geometry and the like. There are some which proceed from principles \nknown by the light of a higher science: thus the science of perspective \nproceeds from principles established by geometry, and music from \nprinciples established by arithmetic. So it is that sacred doctrine is a \nscience because it proceeds from principles established by the  light of \na higher science, namely, the science of God and the blessed. Hence, just \nas the musician accepts on authority the principles taught him by the \nmathematician, so sacred science is established on principles revealed by \nGod.",

The unity of a faculty or \nhabit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material aspect, \nbut as regards the precise formality under which it is an object. For \nexample, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise formality of being \ncolored; and color is the formal object of sight. Therefore, because \nSacred Scripture considers things precisely under the formality of being \ndivinely revealed, whatever has been divinely revealed possesses the one \nprecise formality of the object of this science; and therefore is \nincluded under sacred doctrine as under one science.",
        "RP1": "Sacred doctrine does not treat of God and creatures \nequally, but of God primarily, and of creatures only so far as they are \nreferable to God as their beginning or end. Hence the unity of this \nscience is not impaired.",
        "RP2": "Nothing prevents inferior faculties or habits from being \ndifferentiated by something which falls under a higher  faculty or habit \nas well; because the higher faculty or habit regards the object in its \nmore universal formality, as the object of the \"common sense\" is whatever \naffects the senses, including, therefore, whatever is visible or audible. \nHence the \"common sense,\" although one faculty, extends to all the \nobjects of the five senses. Similarly, objects which are the \nsubject-matter of different philosophical sciences can yet be treated of \nby this one single sacred science under one aspect precisely so far as \nthey can be included in revelation. So that in this way, sacred doctrine \nbears, as it were, the stamp of the divine science which is one and \nsimple, yet extends to everything."

But sacred doctrine is ordained to action: \"Be \nye doers of the word, and not hearers only\" (James 1:22). Therefore \nsacred doctrine is a practical science.",

Hence, although among the philosophical sciences one \nis speculative and another practical, nevertheless sacred doctrine \nincludes both; as God, by one and the same science, knows both Himself \nand His works. Still, it is speculative rather than practical because it \nis more concerned with divine things than with human acts; though it does \ntreat even of these latter, inasmuch as man is ordained by them to the \nperfect knowledge of God in which consists eternal bliss.

Therefore other sciences seem to be nobler.",
        "OB2": "Further, it is the sign of a lower science to depend upon a \nhigher; as music depends on arithmetic. But sacred doctrine does in a \nsense depend upon philosophical sciences; for Jerome observes, in his \nEpistle to Magnus, that \"the ancient doctors so enriched their books with \nthe ideas and phrases of the philosophers, that thou knowest not what \nmore to admire in them, their profane erudition or their scriptural \nlearning.\" Therefore sacred doctrine is inferior to other sciences.",

Now one \nspeculative science is said to be nobler than another, either by reason \nof its greater certitude, or by reason of the higher worth of its \nsubject-matter. In both these respects this science surpasses other \nspeculative sciences; in point of greater certitude, because other \nsciences derive their certitude from the natural light of human reason, \nwhich can err; whereas this derives its certitude from the light of \ndivine knowledge, which cannot be misled: in point of the higher worth of \nits subject-matter because this science treats chiefly of those things \nwhich by their sublimity transcend human reason; while other sciences \nconsider only those things which are within reason's grasp. Of the \npractical sciences, that one is nobler which is ordained to a further \npurpose, as political science is nobler than military science; for the \ngood of the army is directed to the good of the State. But the purpose of \nthis science, in so far as it is practical, is eternal bliss; to which as \nto an ultimate end the purposes of every practical science are directed. \nHence it is clear that from every standpoint, it is nobler than other \nsciences.",

Hence the \nfact that some happen to doubt about articles of faith is not due to the \nuncertain nature of the truths, but to the weakness of human \nintelligence; yet the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the \nhighest things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge obtained \nof lesser things, as is said in de Animalibus xi.",

Therefore it does not \ndepend upon other sciences as upon the higher, but makes use of them as \nof the lesser, and as handmaidens: even so the master sciences make use \nof the sciences that supply their materials, as political of military \nscience.

For since it is the part of a \nwise man to arrange and to judge, and since lesser matters should be \njudged in the light of some higher principle, he is said to be wise in \nany one order who considers the highest principle in that order: thus in \nthe order of building, he who plans the form of the house is called wise \nand architect, in opposition to the inferior laborers who trim the wood \nand make ready the stones: \"As a wise architect, I have laid the \nfoundation\" (1 Cor. 3:10). Again, in the order of all human life, the \nprudent man is called wise, inasmuch as he directs his acts to a fitting \nend: \"Wisdom is prudence to a man\" (Prov. 10: 23). Therefore he who \nconsiders absolutely the highest cause of the whole universe, namely God, \nis most of all called wise. Hence wisdom is said to be the knowledge of \ndivine things, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 14). But sacred doctrine \nessentially treats of God viewed as the highest cause---not only so far \nas He can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew \nHim---\"That which is known of God is manifest in them\" (Rm. 1:19)---but \nalso as far as He is known to Himself alone and revealed to others.

In \nanother way, by knowledge, just as a man learned in moral science might \nbe able to judge rightly about virtuous acts, though he had not the \nvirtue. The first manner of judging divine things belongs to that wisdom \nwhich is set down among the gifts of the Holy Ghost: \"The spiritual man \njudgeth all things\" (1 Cor. 2:15). And Dionysius says (Div.

The \nobject of the principles and of the whole science must be the same, since \nthe whole science is contained virtually in its principles. Some, \nhowever, looking to what is treated of in this science, and not to the \naspect under which it is treated, have asserted the object of this \nscience to be something other than God---that is, either things and \nsigns; or the works of salvation; or the whole Christ, as the head and \nmembers.

If it is from authority, it seems \nunbefitting its dignity, for the proof from authority is the weakest form \nof proof. But if it is from reason, this is unbefitting its end, because, \naccording to Gregory (Hom. 26), \"faith has no merit in those things of \nwhich human reason brings its own experience.\" Therefore sacred doctrine \nis not a matter of argument.",

However, it is \nto be borne in mind, in regard to the philosophical sciences, that the \ninferior sciences neither prove their principles nor dispute with those \nwho deny them, but leave this to a higher science; whereas the highest of \nthem, viz. metaphysics, can dispute with one who denies its principles, \nif only the opponent will make some concession; but if he concede \nnothing, it can have no dispute with him, though it can answer his \nobjections. Hence Sacred Scripture, since it has no science above itself, \ncan dispute with one who denies its principles only if the opponent \nadmits some at least of the truths obtained through divine revelation; \nthus we can argue with heretics from texts in Holy Writ, and against \nthose who deny one article of faith, we can argue from another. If our \nopponent believes nothing of divine revelation, there is no longer any \nmeans of proving the articles of faith by reasoning, but only of \nanswering his objections---if he has any---against faith. Since faith \nrests upon infallible truth, and since the contrary of a truth can never \nbe demonstrated, it is clear that the arguments brought against faith \ncannot be demonstrations, but are difficulties that can be answered.",

Nor does this take away from the dignity of this doctrine, for \nalthough the argument from authority based on human reason is the \nweakest, yet the argument from authority based on divine revelation is \nthe strongest. But sacred doctrine makes use even of human reason, not, \nindeed, to prove faith (for thereby the merit of faith would come to an \nend), but to make clear other things that are put forward in this \ndoctrine. Since therefore grace does not destroy nature but perfects it, \nnatural reason should minister to faith as the natural bent of the will \nministers to charity. Hence the Apostle says: \"Bringing into captivity \nevery understanding unto the obedience of Christ\" (2 Cor. 10:5). Hence \nsacred doctrine makes use also of the authority of philosophers in those \nquestions in which they were able to know the truth by natural reason, as \nPaul quotes a saying of Aratus: \"As some also of your own poets said: For \nwe are also His offspring\" (Acts 17:28). Nevertheless, sacred doctrine \nmakes use of these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments; but \nproperly uses the authority of the canonical Scriptures as an \nincontrovertible proof, and the authority of the doctors of the Church as \none that may properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our faith \nrests upon the revelation made to the apostles and prophets who wrote the \ncanonical books, and not on the revelations (if any such there are) made \nto other doctors. Hence Augustine says (Epis. ad Hieron. xix, 1): \"Only \nthose books of Scripture which are called canonical have I learned to \nhold in such honor as to believe their authors have not erred in any way \nin writing them.

Hence those things that are taught metaphorically in one part of \nScripture, in other parts are taught more openly. The very hiding of \ntruth in figures is useful for the exercise of thoughtful minds and as a \ndefense against the ridicule of the impious, according to the words \"Give \nnot that which is holy to dogs\" (Mt. 7:6).",

For then it is clear that \nthese things are not literal descriptions of divine truths, which might \nhave been open to doubt had they been expressed under the figure of \nnobler bodies, especially for those who could think of nothing nobler \nthan bodies. Secondly, because this is more befitting the knowledge of \nGod that we have in this life. For what He is not is clearer to us than \nwhat He is. Therefore similitudes drawn from things farthest away from \nGod form within us a truer estimate that God is above whatsoever we may \nsay or think of Him.

        "ANS": "The author of Holy Writ is God, in whose power it is to \nsignify His meaning, not by words only (as man also can do), but also by \nthings themselves. So, whereas in every other science things are \nsignified by words, this science has the property, that the things \nsignified by the words have themselves also a signification. Therefore \nthat first signification whereby words signify things belongs to the \nfirst sense, the historical or literal. That signification whereby things \nsignified by words have themselves also a signification is called the \nspiritual sense, which is based on the literal, and presupposes it. Now \nthis spiritual sense has a threefold division. For as the Apostle says \n(Heb. 10:1) the Old Law is a figure of the New Law, and Dionysius says \n(Coel. Hier. i) \"the New Law itself is a figure of future glory.\" Again, \nin the New Law, whatever our Head has done is a type of what we ought to \ndo. Therefore, so far as the things of the Old Law signify the things of \nthe New Law, there is the allegorical sense; so far as the things done in \nChrist, or so far as the things which signify Christ, are types of what \nwe ought to do, there is the moral sense. But so far as they signify what \nrelates to eternal glory, there is the anagogical sense. Since the \nliteral sense is that which the author intends, and since the author of \nHoly Writ is God, Who by one act comprehends all things by His intellect, \nit is not unfitting, as Augustine says (Confess. xii), if, even according \nto the literal sense, one word in Holy Writ should have several senses.",
        "RP1": "The multiplicity of these senses does not produce \nequivocation or any other kind of multiplicity, seeing that these senses \nare not multiplied because one word signifies several things, but because \nthe things signified by the words can be themselves types of other \nthings. Thus in Holy Writ no confusion results, for all the senses are \nfounded on one---the literal---from which alone can any argument be \ndrawn, and not from those intended in allegory, as Augustine says (Epis. \n48). Nevertheless, nothing of Holy Scripture perishes on account of this, \nsince nothing necessary to faith is contained under the spiritual sense \nwhich is not elsewhere put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense.",
        "RP2": "These three---history, etiology, analogy---are grouped \nunder the literal sense. For it is called history, as Augustine expounds \n(Epis. 48), whenever anything is simply related; it is called etiology \nwhen its cause is assigned, as when Our Lord gave the reason why Moses \nallowed the putting away of wives---namely, on account of the hardness of \nmen's hearts; it is called analogy whenever the truth of one text of \nScripture is shown not to contradict the truth of another. Of these four, \nallegory alone stands for the three spiritual senses. Thus Hugh of St. \nVictor (Sacram. iv, 4 Prolog.) includes the anagogical under the \nallegorical sense, laying down three senses only---the historical, the \nallegorical, and the tropological.",
        "RP3": "The parabolical sense is contained in the literal, for by \nwords things are signified properly and figuratively. Nor is the figure \nitself, but that which is figured,  the literal sense. When Scripture \nspeaks of God's arm, the literal sense is not that God has such a member, \nbut only what is signified by this member, namely operative power. Hence \nit is plain that nothing false can ever underlie the literal sense of \nHoly Writ."

But as soon as the signification of \nthe word \"God\" is understood, it is at once seen that God exists. For by \nthis word is signified that thing than which nothing greater can be \nconceived. But that which exists actually and mentally is greater than \nthat which exists only mentally. Therefore, since as soon as the word \n\"God\" is understood it exists mentally, it also follows that it exists \nactually. Therefore the proposition \"God exists\" is self-evident.",

For whoever \ndenies the existence of truth grants that truth does not exist: and, if \ntruth does not exist, then the proposition \"Truth does not exist\" is \ntrue: and if there is anything true, there must be truth.

        "ANS": "A thing can be self-evident in either of two ways: on the \none hand, self-evident in itself, though not to us; on the other, \nself-evident in itself, and to us. A proposition is self-evident because \nthe predicate is included in the essence of the subject, as \"Man is an \nanimal,\" for animal is contained in the essence of man. If, therefore the \nessence of the predicate and subject be known to all, the proposition \nwill be self-evident to all; as is clear with regard to the first \nprinciples of demonstration, the terms of which are common things that no \none is ignorant of, such as being and non-being, whole and part, and such \nlike. If, however, there are some to whom the essence of the predicate \nand subject is unknown, the proposition will be self-evident in itself, \nbut not to those who do not know the meaning of the predicate and subject \nof the proposition. Therefore, it happens, as Boethius says (Hebdom., the \ntitle of which is: \"Whether all that is, is good\"), \"that there are some \nmental concepts self-evident only to the learned, as that incorporeal \nsubstances are not in space.\" Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God \nexists,\" of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the \nsubject, because God is His own existence as will be hereafter shown \n(Question [3], Article [4]).

And from \nevery effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated, so \nlong as its effects are better known to us; because since every effect \ndepends upon its cause, if the effect exists, the cause must pre-exist. \nHence the existence of God, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, \ncan be demonstrated from those of His effects which are known to us.",

Therefore there is no need to \nsuppose God's existence.",
        "CON": "It is said in the person of God: \"I am Who am.\" (Ex. 3:14)",
        "ANS": "The existence of God can be proved in five ways.\nThe first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is \ncertain, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in \nmotion. Now whatever is in motion is put in motion by another, for \nnothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to that towards \nwhich it is in motion; whereas a thing moves  inasmuch as it is in act. \nFor motion is nothing else than the reduction of something from \npotentiality to actuality. But nothing can be reduced from potentiality \nto actuality, except by something in a state of actuality. Thus that \nwhich is actually hot, as fire, makes wood, which is potentially hot, to \nbe actually hot, and thereby moves and changes it. Now it is not possible \nthat the same thing should be at once in actuality and potentiality in \nthe same respect, but only in different respects. For what is actually \nhot cannot simultaneously be potentially hot; but it is simultaneously \npotentially cold. It is therefore impossible that in the same respect and \nin the same way a thing should be both mover and moved, i.e. that it \nshould move itself. Therefore, whatever is in motion must be put in \nmotion by another. If that by which it is put in motion be itself put in \nmotion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that \nby another again. But this cannot go on to infinity, because then there \nwould be no first mover, and, consequently, no other mover; seeing that \nsubsequent movers move only inasmuch as they are put in motion by the \nfirst mover; as the staff moves only because it is put in motion by the \nhand. Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion \nby no other; and this everyone understands to be God.\nThe second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world \nof sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case \nknown (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be \nthe efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which \nis impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to \ninfinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first \nis the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause \nof the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only \none. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if \nthere be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no \nultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is \npossible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, \nneither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient \ncauses; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit \na first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God.\nThe third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We \nfind in nature things that are possible to be and not to be, since they \nare found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are \npossible to be and not to be. But it is impossible for these always to \nexist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not. \nTherefore, if everything is possible not to be, then at one time there \ncould have been nothing in existence. Now if this were true, even now \nthere would be nothing in existence, because that which does not exist \nonly begins to exist by something already existing. Therefore, if at one \ntime nothing was in existence, it would have been impossible for anything \nto have begun to exist; and thus even now nothing would be in \nexistence---which is absurd. Therefore, not all beings are merely \npossible, but there must exist something the existence of  which is \nnecessary. But every necessary thing either has its necessity caused by \nanother, or not. Now it is impossible to go on to infinity in necessary \nthings which have their necessity caused by another, as has been already \nproved in regard to efficient causes. Therefore we cannot but postulate \nthe existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not \nreceiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. \nThis all men speak of as God.\nThe fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among \nbeings there are some more and some less good, true, noble and the like. \nBut \"more\" and \"less\" are predicated of different things, according as \nthey resemble in their different ways something which is the maximum, as \na thing is said to be hotter according as it more nearly resembles that \nwhich is hottest; so that there is something which is truest, something \nbest, something noblest and, consequently, something which is uttermost \nbeing; for those things that are greatest in truth are greatest in being, \nas it is written in Metaph. ii. Now the maximum in any genus is the cause \nof all in that genus; as fire, which is the maximum heat, is the cause of \nall hot things. Therefore there must also be something which is to all \nbeings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; \nand this we call God.\nThe fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that \nthings which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, \nand this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the \nsame way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not \nfortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever \nlacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by \nsome being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is shot \nto its mark by the archer. Therefore some intelligent being exists by \nwhom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call \nGod.",

        "RP2": "Since nature works for a determinate end under the \ndirection of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be \ntraced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done \nvoluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than \nhuman reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that \nare changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable \nand self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the \nArticle."

Now it has been already \nproved (Question [2], Article [3]), that God is the First Mover, and is Himself unmoved. \nTherefore it is clear that God is not a body. Secondly, because the first \nbeing must of necessity be in act, and in no way in potentiality. For \nalthough in any single thing that passes from potentiality to actuality, \nthe potentiality is prior in time to the actuality; nevertheless, \nabsolutely speaking, actuality is prior to potentiality; for whatever is \nin potentiality can be reduced into actuality only by some being in \nactuality. Now it has been already proved that God is the First Being. It \nis therefore impossible that in God there should be any potentiality. But \nevery body is in potentiality because the continuous, as such, is \ndivisible to infinity; it is therefore impossible that God should be a \nbody. Thirdly, because God is the most noble of beings. Now it is \nimpossible for a body to be the most noble of beings; for a body must be \neither animate or inanimate; and an animate body is manifestly nobler \nthan any inanimate body. But an animate body is not animate precisely as \nbody; otherwise all bodies would be animate.

Or, as says Dionysius \n(Div.

For this particular flesh, these bones, this blackness or \nwhiteness, etc., are not included in the definition of a man. Therefore \nthis flesh, these bones, and the accidental qualities distinguishing this \nparticular matter, are not included in humanity; and yet they are \nincluded in the thing which is man. Hence the thing which is a man has \nsomething more in it than has humanity. Consequently humanity and a man \nare not wholly identical; but humanity is taken to mean the formal part \nof a man, because the principles whereby a thing is defined are regarded \nas the formal constituent in regard to the individualizing matter. On the \nother hand, in things not composed of matter and form, in which \nindividualization is not due to individual matter---that is to say, to \n\"this\" matter---the very forms being individualized of themselves---it is \nnecessary the forms themselves should be subsisting \"supposita.\" \nTherefore \"suppositum\" and nature in them are identified. Since God then \nis not composed of matter and form, He must be His own Godhead, His own \nLife, and whatever else is thus predicated of Him.",

First, whatever a thing has besides its essence must be \ncaused either by the constituent principles of that essence (like a \nproperty that necessarily accompanies the species---as the faculty of \nlaughing is proper to a man---and is caused by the constituent principles \nof the species), or by some exterior agent---as heat is caused in water \nby fire. Therefore, if the existence of a thing differs from its essence, \nthis existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its \nessential principles. Now it is impossible for a thing's existence to be \ncaused by its essential constituent principles, for nothing can be the \nsufficient cause of its own existence, if its existence is caused. \nTherefore that thing, whose existence differs from its essence, must have \nits existence caused by another. But this cannot be true of God; because \nwe call God the first efficient cause. Therefore it is impossible that in \nGod His existence should differ from His essence. Secondly, existence is \nthat which makes every form or nature actual; for goodness and humanity \nare spoken of as actual, only because they are spoken of as existing. \nTherefore existence must be compared to essence, if the latter is a \ndistinct reality, as actuality to potentiality. Therefore, since in God \nthere is no potentiality, as shown above (Article [1]), it follows that in Him \nessence does not differ from existence. Therefore His essence is His \nexistence. Thirdly, because, just as that which has fire, but is not \nitself fire, is on fire by participation; so that which has existence but \nis not existence, is a being by participation. But God is His own \nessence, as shown above (Article [3]) if, therefore, He is not His own existence \nHe will be not essential, but participated being.

        "ANS": "A thing can be in a genus in two ways; either absolutely \nand properly, as a species contained under a genus; or as being reducible \nto it, as principles and privations. For example, a point and unity are \nreduced to the genus of quantity, as its principles; while blindness and \nall other privations are reduced to the genus of habit. But in neither \nway is God in a genus. That He cannot be a species of any genus may be \nshown in three ways. First, because a species is constituted of genus and \ndifference. Now that from which the difference constituting the species \nis derived, is always related to that from which the genus is derived, as \nactuality is related to potentiality. For animal is derived from \nsensitive nature, by concretion as it were, for that is animal, which has \na sensitive nature. Rational being, on the other hand, is derived from \nintellectual nature, because that is rational, which has an intellectual \nnature, and intelligence is compared to sense, as actuality is to \npotentiality. The same argument holds good in other things. Hence since \nin God actuality is not added to potentiality, it is impossible that He \nshould be in any genus as a species. Secondly, since the existence of God \nis His essence, if God were in any genus, He would be the genus \"being\", \nbecause, since genus is predicated as an essential it refers to the \nessence of a thing. But the Philosopher has shown (Metaph. iii) that \nbeing cannot be a genus, for every genus has differences distinct from \nits generic essence. Now no difference can exist distinct from being; for \nnon-being cannot be a difference. It follows then that God is not in a \ngenus. Thirdly, because all in one genus agree in the quiddity or essence \nof the genus which is predicated of them as an essential, but they differ \nin their existence. For the existence of man and of horse is not the \nsame; as also of this man and that man: thus in every member of a genus, \nexistence and quiddity---i.e. essence---must differ. But in God they do \nnot differ, as shown in the preceding article. Therefore it is plain that \nGod is not in a genus as if He were a species. From this it is also plain \nthat He has no genus nor difference, nor can there be any definition of \nHim; nor, save through His effects, a demonstration of Him: for a \ndefinition is from genus and difference; and the mean of a demonstration \nis a definition. That  God is not in a genus, as reducible to it as its \nprinciple, is clear from this, that a principle reducible to any genus \ndoes not extend beyond that genus; as, a point is the principle of \ncontinuous quantity alone; and unity, of discontinuous quantity.

For there is neither \ncomposition of quantitative parts in God, since He is not a body; nor \ncomposition of matter and form; nor does His nature differ from His \n\"suppositum\"; nor His essence from His existence; neither is there in Him \ncomposition of genus and difference, nor of subject and accident. \nTherefore, it is clear that God is nowise composite, but is altogether \nsimple. Secondly, because every composite is posterior to its component \nparts, and is dependent on them; but God is the first being, as shown \nabove (Question [2], Article [3]). Thirdly, because every composite has a cause, for \nthings in themselves different cannot unite unless something causes them \nto unite. But God is uncaused, as shown above (Question [2], Article [3]), since He is \nthe first efficient cause. Fourthly, because in every composite there \nmust be potentiality and actuality; but this does not apply to God; for \neither one of the parts actuates another, or at least all the parts are \npotential to the whole. Fifthly, because nothing composite can be \npredicated of any single one of its parts. And this is evident in a whole \nmade up of dissimilar parts; for no part of a man is a man, nor any of \nthe parts of the foot, a foot. But in wholes made up of similar parts, \nalthough something which is  predicated of the whole may be predicated of \na part (as a part of the air is air, and a part of water, water), \nnevertheless certain things are predicable of the whole which cannot be \npredicated of any of the parts; for instance, if the whole volume of \nwater is two cubits, no part of it can be two cubits. Thus in every \ncomposite there is something which is not it itself. But, even if this \ncould be said of whatever has a form, viz. that it has something which is \nnot it itself, as in a white object there is something which does not \nbelong to the essence of white; nevertheless in the form itself, there is \nnothing besides itself. And so, since God is absolute form, or rather \nabsolute being, He can be in no way composite.

First, because whatever perfection exists \nin an effect must be found in the effective cause: either in the same \nformality, if it is a univocal agent---as when man reproduces man; or in \na more eminent degree, if it is an equivocal agent---thus in the sun is \nthe likeness of whatever is generated by the sun's power. Now it is plain \nthat the effect pre-exists virtually in the efficient cause: and although \nto pre-exist in the potentiality of a material cause is to pre-exist in a \nmore imperfect way, since matter as such is imperfect, and an agent as \nsuch is perfect; still to pre-exist virtually in the efficient cause is \nto pre-exist not in a more imperfect, but in a  more perfect way.

For granted that a body exists infinite in \nmagnitude, as fire or air, yet this could not be infinite in essence, \nbecause its essence would be terminated in a species by its form, and \nconfined to individuality by matter. And so assuming from these premises \nthat no creature is infinite in essence, it still remains to inquire \nwhether any creature can be infinite in magnitude.\nWe must therefore observe that a body, which is a complete magnitude, \ncan be considered in two ways; mathematically, in respect to its quantity \nonly; and naturally, as regards its matter and form.\nNow it is manifest that a natural body cannot be actually infinite.

So every natural body has a greater or \nsmaller determinate quantity. Hence it is impossible for a natural body \nto be infinite. The same appears from movement; because every natural \nbody has some natural movement; whereas an infinite body could not have \nany natural movement; neither direct, because nothing moves naturally by \na direct movement unless it is out of its place; and this could not \nhappen to an infinite body, for it would occupy every place, and thus \nevery place would be indifferently its own place.

For if we imagine a \nmathematical body actually existing, we must imagine it under some form, \nbecause nothing is actual except by its form; hence, since the form of \nquantity as such is figure, such a body must have some figure, and so \nwould be finite; for figure is confined by a term or boundary.",

A multitude is said to be infinite \nabsolutely, when an infinite multitude is necessary that something may \nexist. Now this is impossible; because it would entail something \ndependent on an infinity for its existence; and hence its generation \ncould never come to be, because it is impossible to pass through an \ninfinite medium.\nA multitude is said to be accidentally infinite when its existence as \nsuch is not necessary, but accidental. This can be shown, for example, in \nthe work of a carpenter requiring a certain absolute multitude; namely, \nart in the soul, the movement of the hand, and a hammer; and supposing \nthat such things were infinitely multiplied, the carpentering work would \nnever be finished, forasmuch as it would depend on an infinite number of \ncauses.

In this way they said that there can be an accidentally \ninfinite multitude.\nThis, however, is impossible; since every kind of multitude must belong \nto a species of multitude. Now the species of multitude are to be \nreckoned by the species of numbers. But no species of number is infinite; \nfor every number is multitude measured by one. Hence it is impossible for \nthere to be an actually infinite multitude, either absolute or \naccidental. Likewise multitude in nature is created; and everything \ncreated is comprehended under some clear intention of the Creator; for no \nagent acts aimlessly. Hence everything created must be comprehended in a \ncertain number. Therefore it is impossible for an actually infinite \nmultitude to exist, even accidentally. But a potentially infinite \nmultitude is possible; because the increase of multitude follows upon the \ndivision of magnitude; since the more a thing is divided, the greater \nnumber of things result. Hence, as the infinite is to be found \npotentially in the division of the continuous, because we thus approach \nmatter, as was shown in the preceding article, by the same rule, the \ninfinite can be also found potentially in the addition of multitude.",

This appears also in accidental forms which have \naccidental quantity; as an example, whiteness is whole in each part of \nthe surface if we speak of its totality of essence; because according to \nthe perfect idea of its species it is found to exist in every part of the \nsurface.

Be it known therefore that a mutable thing can be \ncalled so in two ways: by a power in itself; and by a power possessed by \nanother. For all creatures before they existed, were possible, not by any \ncreated power, since no creature is eternal, but by the divine power \nalone, inasmuch as God could produce them into existence. Thus, as the \nproduction of a thing into existence depends on the will of God, so \nlikewise it depends on His will that things should be preserved; for He \ndoes not preserve them otherwise than by ever giving them existence; \nhence if He took away His action from them, all things would be reduced \nto nothing, as appears from Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 12). Therefore as \nit was in the Creator's power to produce them before they existed in \nthemselves, so likewise it is in the Creator's power when they exist in \nthemselves to bring them to nothing. In this way therefore, by the power \nof another---namely, of God---they are mutable, inasmuch as they are \nproducible from nothing by Him, and are by Him reducible from existence \nto non-existence.\nIf, however, a thing is called mutable by a power in itself, thus also \nin some manner every creature is mutable. For every creature has a \ntwofold power, active and passive; and I call that power passive which \nenables anything to attain its perfection either in being, or in \nattaining to its end. Now if the mutability of a thing be considered \naccording to its power for being, in that way all creatures are not \nmutable, but those only in which what is potential in them is consistent \nwith non-being. Hence, in the inferior bodies there is mutability both as \nregards substantial being, inasmuch as their matter can exist with \nprivation of their substantial form, and also as regards their accidental \nbeing, supposing the subject to coexist with privation of accident; as,  \nfor example, this subject \"man\" can exist with \"not-whiteness\" and can \ntherefore be changed from white to not-white. But supposing the accident \nto be such as to follow on the essential principles of the subject, then \nthe privation of such an accident cannot coexist with the subject. Hence \nthe subject cannot be changed as regards that kind of accident; as, for \nexample, snow cannot be made black. Now in the celestial bodies matter is \nnot consistent with privation of form, because the form perfects the \nwhole potentiality of the matter; therefore these bodies are not mutable \nas to substantial being, but only as to locality, because the subject is \nconsistent with privation of this or that place. On the other hand \nincorporeal substances, being subsistent forms which, although with \nrespect to their own existence are as potentiality to act, are not \nconsistent with the privation of this act; forasmuch as existence is \nconsequent upon form, and nothing corrupts except it lose its form. Hence \nin the form itself there is no power to non-existence; and so these kinds \nof substances are immutable and invariable as regards their existence. \nWherefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"intellectual created \nsubstances are pure from generation and from every variation, as also are \nincorporeal and immaterial substances.\" Still, there remains in them a \ntwofold mutability: one as regards their potentiality to their end; and \nin that way there is in them a mutability according to choice from good \nto evil, as Damascene says (De Fide ii, 3,4); the other as regards place, \ninasmuch as by their finite power they attain to certain fresh \nplaces---which cannot be said of God, who by His infinity fills all \nplaces, as was shown above (Question [8], Article [2]).\nThus in every creature there is a potentiality to change either as \nregards substantial being as in the case of things corruptible; or as \nregards locality only, as in the case of the celestial bodies; or as \nregards the order to their end, and the application of their powers to \ndivers objects, as in the case with the angels; and universally all \ncreatures generally are mutable by the power of the Creator, in Whose \npower is their existence and non-existence. Hence since God is in none of \nthese ways mutable, it belongs to Him alone to be altogether immutable.",

This difference, \nhowever, is but an accidental one, as was shown above, in the preceding \narticle; because even if aeviternal things had always been, and would \nalways be, as some think, and even if they might sometimes fail to be, \nwhich is possible to God to allow; even granted this, aeviternity would \nstill be distinguished from eternity, and from time.\nOthers assign the difference between these three to consist in the fact \nthat eternity has no \"before\" and \"after\"; but that time has both, \ntogether with innovation and veteration; and that aeviternity has \n\"before\" and \"after\" without innovation and veteration. This theory, \nhowever, involves a contradiction; which manifestly appears if innovation \nand veteration be referred to the measure itself. For since \"before\" and \n\"after\" of duration cannot exist together, if aeviternity has \"before\" \nand \"after,\" it must follow that with the receding of the first part of \naeviternity, the after part of aeviternity must newly appear; and thus \ninnovation would occur in aeviternity itself, as it does in time. And if \nthey be referred to the things measured, even then an incongruity would \nfollow. For a thing which exists in time grows old with time, because it \nhas a changeable existence, and from the changeableness of a thing \nmeasured, there follows \"before\" and \"after\" in the measure, as is clear \nfrom Phys. iv. Therefore the fact that an aeviternal thing is neither \ninveterate, nor subject to innovation, comes from its changelessness; and \nconsequently its measure does not contain \"before\" and \"after.\" We say \nthen that since eternity is the measure of a permanent being, in so far \nas anything recedes  from permanence of being, it recedes from eternity. \nNow some things recede from permanence of being, so that their being is \nsubject to change, or consists in change; and these things are measured \nby time, as are all movements, and also the being of all things \ncorruptible. But others recede less from permanence of being, forasmuch \nas their being neither consists in change, nor is the subject of change; \nnevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually or \npotentially. This appears in the heavenly bodies, the substantial being \nof which is unchangeable; and yet with unchangeable being they have \nchangeableness of place. The same applies to the angels, who have an \nunchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards \nchoice; moreover they have changeableness of intelligence, of affections \nand of places in their own degree. Therefore these are measured by \naeviternity which is a mean between eternity and time.

This, however, is not a \nsufficient reason; because time is not a number abstracted from the thing \nnumbered, but existing in the thing numbered; otherwise it would not be \ncontinuous; for ten ells of cloth are continuous not by reason of the \nnumber, but by reason of the thing numbered. Now number as it exists in \nthe thing numbered, is not the same for all; but it is different for \ndifferent things. Hence, others assert that the unity of eternity as the \nprinciple of all duration is the cause of the unity of time. Thus all \ndurations are one in that view, in the light of their principle, but are \nmany in the light of the diversity of things receiving duration from the \ninflux of the first principle. On the other hand others assign primary \nmatter as the cause why time is one; as it is the first subject of \nmovement, the measure of which is time. Neither of these reasons, \nhowever, is sufficient; forasmuch as things which are one in principle, \nor in subject, especially if distant, are not one absolutely, but \naccidentally. Therefore the true reason why time is one, is to be found \nin the oneness of the first movement by which, since it is most simple, \nall other movements are measured. Therefore time is referred to that \nmovement, not only as a measure is to the thing measured, but also as \naccident is to subject; and  thus receives unity from it. Whereas to \nother movements it is compared only as the measure is to the thing \nmeasured. Hence it is not multiplied by their multitude, because by one \nseparate measure many things can be measured.\nThis being established, we must observe that a twofold opinion existed \nconcerning spiritual substances.

Others said that all spiritual substances \nproceeded from God in a certain degree and order; and Dionysius (Coel. \nHier. x) seems to have thought so, when he said that among spiritual \nsubstances there are the first, the middle and the last; even in one \norder of angels. Now according to the first opinion, it must be said that \nthere are many aeviternities as there are many aeviternal things of first \ndegree. But according to the second opinion, it would be necessary to say \nthat there is one aeviternity only; because since each thing is measured \nby the most simple element of its genus, it must be that the existence of \nall aeviternal things should be measured by the existence of the first \naeviternal thing, which is all the more simple the nearer it is to the \nfirst.

For it is manifest that the reason why any \nsingular thing is \"this particular thing\" is because it cannot be \ncommunicated to many: since that whereby Socrates is a man, can be \ncommunicated to many; whereas, what makes him this particular man, is \nonly communicable to one. Therefore, if Socrates were a man by what makes \nhim to be this particular man, as there cannot be many Socrates, so there \ncould not in that way be many men. Now this belongs to God alone; for God \nHimself is His own nature, as was shown above (Question [3], Article [3]). Therefore, in \nthe very same way God is God, and He is this God. Impossible is it \ntherefore that many Gods should exist.\nSecondly, this is proved from the infinity of His perfection. For it was \nshown above (Question [4], Article [2]) that God comprehends in Himself the whole \nperfection of being. If then many gods existed, they would necessarily \ndiffer from each other. Something therefore would belong to one which did \nnot belong to another. And if this were a privation, one of them would \nnot be absolutely perfect; but if a perfection, one of them would be \nwithout it. So it is impossible for many gods to exist. Hence also the \nancient philosophers, constrained as it were by truth, when they asserted \nan infinite principle, asserted likewise that there was only one such \nprinciple.\nThirdly, this is shown from the unity of the world. For all things that \nexist are seen to be ordered to each other since some serve others. But \nthings that are diverse do not harmonize in the same order, unless they \nare ordered thereto by one. For many are reduced into one order by one \nbetter than by many: because one is the \"per se\" cause of one, and many \nare only the accidental cause of one, inasmuch as they are in some way \none.

But if \nthe principle of the visual power and the thing seen were one and the \nsame thing, it would necessarily follow that the seer would receive both \nthe visual power and the form whereby it sees, from that one same thing.\nNow it is manifest both that God is the author of the intellect power, \nand that He can be seen by the intellect.

Now this cannot in any way be represented by any \ncreated likeness; for every created form is determined according to some \naspect of wisdom, or of power, or of being itself, or of some like thing. \nHence to say that God is seen by some similitude, is to say that the \ndivine essence is not seen at all; which is false.\nTherefore it must be said that to see the essence of God, there is \nrequired some similitude in the visual faculty, namely, the light of \nglory strengthening the intellect to see God, which is spoken of in the \nPs. 35:10, \"In Thy light we shall see light.\" The essence of God, \nhowever, cannot be seen by any created similitude representing the divine \nessence itself as it really is.",

By this light the blessed are made \"deiform\"---i.e. \nlike to God, according to the saying: \"When He shall appear we shall be \nlike to Him, and [Vulg.: 'because'] we shall see Him as He is\" (1 Jn. 2:2).",
        "RP1": "The created light is necessary to see the essence of God, \nnot in order to make the essence of God intelligible, which is of itself \nintelligible, but in order to enable the intellect to understand in the \nsame way as a habit makes a power abler to act. Even so corporeal light \nis necessary as regards external sight, inasmuch as it makes the medium \nactually transparent, and susceptible of color.",
        "RP2": "This light is required to see the divine essence, not as a \nsimilitude in which God is seen, but as a perfection of the intellect, \nstrengthening it to see God. Therefore it may be said that this light is \nto be described not as a medium in which God is seen, but as one by which \nHe is seen; and such a medium does not take away the immediate vision of \nGod.",
        "RP3": "The disposition to the form of fire can be natural only to \nthe subject of that form. Hence the light of glory cannot be natural to a \ncreature unless the creature has a divine nature; which is impossible. \nBut by this light the rational creature is made deiform, as is said in \nthis article."

On the part of the object, it may \nso happen because the object is received more perfectly in the seer, that \nis, according to the greater perfection of the similitude; but this does \nnot apply to the present question, for God is present to the intellect \nseeing Him not by way of similitude, but by His essence. It follows then \nthat if one sees Him more perfectly than another, this happens according \nto the difference of the intellectual power; thus it follows too that the \none whose intellectual power is higher, will see Him the more clearly; \nand this is incongruous; since equality with angels is promised to men as \ntheir beatitude.",

The faculty \nof seeing God, however, does not belong to the created intellect \nnaturally, but is given to it by the light of glory, which establishes \nthe intellect in a kind of \"deiformity,\" as appears from what is said \nabove, in the preceding article.\nHence the intellect which has more of the light of glory will see God \nthe more perfectly; and he will have a fuller participation of the light \nof glory who has more charity; because where there is the greater \ncharity, there is the more desire; and desire in a certain degree makes \nthe one desiring apt and prepared to receive the object desired.

For when it is said \nthat one intellect does not understand one and the same thing better than \nanother, this would be true if referred to the  mode of the thing \nunderstood, for whoever understands it otherwise than it really is, does \nnot truly understand it, but not if referred to the mode of \nunderstanding, for the understanding of one is more perfect than the \nunderstanding of another.",

Dim., Serm. xxxvii).\nIn proof of this we must consider that what is comprehended is perfectly \nknown; and that is perfectly known which is known so far as it can be \nknown. Thus, if anything which is capable of scientific demonstration is \nheld only by an opinion resting on a probably proof, it is not \ncomprehended; as, for instance, if anyone  knows by scientific \ndemonstration that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles, \nhe comprehends that truth; whereas if anyone accepts it as a probable \nopinion because wise men or most men teach it, he cannot be said to \ncomprehend the thing itself, because he does not attain to that perfect \nmode of knowledge of which it is intrinsically capable. But no created \nintellect can attain to that perfect mode of the knowledge of the Divine \nintellect whereof it is intrinsically capable. Which thus \nappears---Everything is knowable according to its actuality. But God, \nwhose being is infinite, as was shown above (Question [7]) is infinitely \nknowable. Now no created intellect can know God infinitely. For the \ncreated intellect knows the Divine essence more or less perfectly in \nproportion as it receives a greater or lesser light of glory. Since \ntherefore the created light of glory received into any created intellect \ncannot be infinite, it is clearly impossible for any created intellect to \nknow God in an infinite degree. Hence it is impossible that it should \ncomprehend God.",
        "RP1": "\"Comprehension\" is twofold: in one sense it is taken \nstrictly and properly, according as something is included in the one \ncomprehending; and thus in no way is God comprehended either by \nintellect, or in any other way; forasmuch as He is infinite and cannot be \nincluded in any finite being; so that no finite being can contain Him \ninfinitely, in the degree of His own infinity. In this sense we now take \ncomprehension. But in another sense \"comprehension\" is taken more largely \nas opposed to \"non-attainment\"; for he who attains to anyone is said to \ncomprehend him when he attains to him. And in this sense God is \ncomprehended by the blessed, according to the words, \"I held him, and I \nwill not let him go\" (Cant 3:4); in this sense also are to be understood \nthe words quoted from the Apostle concerning comprehension. And in this \nway \"comprehension\" is one of the three prerogatives of the soul, \nresponding to hope, as vision responds to faith, and fruition responds to \ncharity. For even among ourselves not everything seen is held or \npossessed, forasmuch as things either appear sometimes afar off, or they \nare not in our power of attainment. Neither, again, do we always enjoy \nwhat we possess; either because we find no pleasure in them, or because \nsuch things are not the ultimate end of our desire, so as to satisfy and \nquell it. But the blessed possess these three things in God; because they \nsee Him, and in seeing Him, possess Him as present, having the power to \nsee Him always; and possessing Him, they enjoy Him as the ultimate \nfulfilment of desire.",
        "RP2": "God is called incomprehensible not because anything of Him \nis not seen; but because He is not seen as perfectly as He is capable of \nbeing seen; thus when any demonstrable proposition is known by probable \nreason only, it does not follow that any part of it is unknown, either \nthe subject, or the predicate, or the composition; but that it is not as \nperfectly known as it is capable of being known. Hence Augustine, in his \ndefinition of comprehension, says the whole is comprehended when it is \nseen in such a way that nothing of it is hidden from the seer, or when \nits boundaries can be completely viewed or traced; for the  boundaries of \na thing are said to be completely surveyed when the end of the knowledge \nof it is attained.",

For some have \nsaid that all such names, although they are applied to God affirmatively, \nnevertheless have been brought into use more to express some remotion \nfrom God, rather than to express anything that exists positively in Him. \nHence they assert that when we say that God lives, we mean that God is \nnot like an inanimate thing; and the same in like manner applies to other \nnames; and this was taught by Rabbi Moses. Others say that these names \napplied to God signify His relationship towards creatures: thus in the \nwords, \"God is good,\" we mean, God is the cause of goodness in things; \nand the same rule applies to other names.\nBoth of these opinions, however, seem to be untrue for three reasons. \nFirst because in neither of them can a reason be assigned  why some names \nmore than others are applied to God. For He is assuredly the cause of \nbodies in the same way as He is the cause of good things; therefore if \nthe words \"God is good,\" signified no more than, \"God is the cause of \ngood things,\" it might in like manner be said that God is a body, \ninasmuch as He is the cause of bodies. So also to say that He is a body \nimplies that He is not a mere potentiality, as is primary matter. \nSecondly, because it would follow that all names applied to God would be \nsaid of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense, as healthy is \nsecondarily said of medicine, forasmuch as it signifies only the cause of \nthe health in the animal which primarily is called healthy. Thirdly, \nbecause this is against the intention of those who speak of God. For in \nsaying that God lives, they assuredly mean more than to say the He is the \ncause of our life, or that He differs from inanimate bodies.\nTherefore we must hold a different doctrine---viz. that these names \nsignify the divine substance, and are predicated substantially of God, \nalthough they fall short of a full representation of Him. Which is proved \nthus. For these names express God, so far as our intellects know Him. Now \nsince our intellect knows God from creatures, it knows Him as far as \ncreatures represent Him. Now it is shown above (Question [4], Article [2]) that God \nprepossesses in Himself all the perfections of creatures, being Himself \nsimply and universally perfect. Hence every creature represents Him, and \nis like Him so far as it possesses some perfection; yet it represents Him \nnot as something of the same species or genus, but as the excelling \nprinciple of whose form the effects fall short, although they derive some \nkind of likeness thereto, even as the forms of inferior bodies represent \nthe power of the sun. This was explained above (Question [4], Article [3]), in treating \nof the divine perfection. Therefore the aforesaid names signify the \ndivine substance, but in an imperfect manner, even as creatures represent \nit imperfectly. So when we say, \"God is good,\" the meaning is not, \"God \nis the cause of goodness,\" or \"God is not evil\"; but the meaning is, \n\"Whatever good we attribute to creatures, pre-exists in God,\" and in a \nmore excellent and higher way. Hence it does not follow that God is good, \nbecause He causes goodness; but rather, on the contrary, He causes \ngoodness in things because He is good; according to what Augustine says \n(De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), \"Because He is good, we are.\"",

Now a \ndifferent genus changes an essence, since the genus is part of the \ndefinition; and the same applies to other things. Therefore whatever is \nsaid of God and of creatures is predicated equivocally.\nFurther, God is more distant from creatures than any creatures are from \neach other. But the distance of some creatures makes any univocal \npredication of them impossible, as in the case of those things which are \nnot in the same genus. Therefore much less can anything be predicated \nunivocally of God and creatures; and so only equivocal predication can be \napplied to them.",
        "ANS": "Univocal predication is impossible between God and \ncreatures. The reason of this is that every effect which is not an \nadequate result of the power of the efficient cause, receives the \nsimilitude of the agent not in its full degree, but in a measure that \nfalls short, so that what is divided and multiplied in the effects \nresides in the agent simply, and in the same manner; as for example the \nsun by exercise of its one power produces manifold and various forms in \nall inferior things. In the same way, as said in the preceding article, \nall perfections existing in creatures divided and multiplied, pre-exist \nin God unitedly. Thus when any term expressing perfection is applied to a \ncreature, it signifies that perfection distinct in idea from other \nperfections; as, for instance, by the term \"wise\" applied to man, we \nsignify some perfection distinct from a man's essence, and distinct from \nhis power and existence, and from all similar things; whereas when we \napply to it God, we do not mean to signify anything distinct from His \nessence, or power, or existence. Thus also this term \"wise\" applied to \nman in some degree circumscribes and comprehends the thing signified; \nwhereas this is not the case when it is applied to God; but it leaves the \nthing signified as incomprehended, and as  exceeding the signification of \nthe name. Hence it is evident that this term \"wise\" is not applied in the \nsame way to God and to man. The same rule applies to other terms. Hence \nno name is predicated univocally of God and of creatures.\nNeither, on the other hand, are names applied to God and creatures in a \npurely equivocal sense, as some have said. Because if that were so, it \nfollows that from creatures nothing could be known or demonstrated about \nGod at all; for the reasoning would always be exposed to the fallacy of \nequivocation. Such a view is against the philosophers, who proved many \nthings about God, and also against what the Apostle says: \"The invisible \nthings of God are clearly seen being understood by the things that are \nmade\" (Rm. 1:20). Therefore it must be said that these names are said of \nGod and creatures in an analogous sense, i.e. according to proportion.\nNow names are thus used in two ways: either according as many things are \nproportionate to one, thus for example \"healthy\" predicated of medicine \nand urine in relation and in proportion to health of a body, of which the \nformer is the sign and the latter the cause: or according as one thing is \nproportionate to another, thus \"healthy\" is said of medicine and animal, \nsince medicine is the cause of health in the animal body. And in this way \nsome things are said of God and creatures analogically, and not in a \npurely equivocal nor in a purely univocal sense. For we can name God only \nfrom creatures (Article [1]). Thus whatever is said of God and creatures, is \nsaid according to the relation of a creature to God as its principle and \ncause, wherein all perfections of things pre-exist excellently. Now this \nmode of community of idea is a mean between pure equivocation and simple \nunivocation. For in analogies the idea is not, as it is in univocals, one \nand the same, yet it is not totally diverse as in equivocals; but a term \nwhich is thus used in a multiple sense signifies various proportions to \nsome one thing; thus \"healthy\" applied to urine signifies the sign of \nanimal health, and applied to medicine signifies the cause of the same \nhealth.",

Thus, for \ninstance, \"healthy\" applied to animals comes into the definition of \n\"healthy\" applied to medicine, which is called healthy as being the cause \nof health in the animal; and also into the definition of \"healthy\" which \nis applied to urine, which is called healthy in so far as it is the  sign \nof the animal's health. Thus all names applied metaphorically to God, are \napplied to creatures primarily rather than to God, because when said of \nGod they mean only similitudes to such creatures. For as \"smiling\" \napplied to a field means only that the field in the beauty of its \nflowering is like the beauty of the human smile by proportionate \nlikeness, so the name of \"lion\" applied to God means only that God \nmanifests strength in His works, as a lion in his. Thus it is clear that \napplied to God the signification of names can be defined only from what \nis said of creatures. But to other names not applied to God in a \nmetaphorical sense, the same rule would apply if they were spoken of God \nas the cause only, as some have supposed. For when it is said, \"God is \ngood,\" it would then only mean \"God is the cause of the creature's \ngoodness\"; thus the term good applied to God would included in its \nmeaning the creature's goodness. Hence \"good\" would apply primarily to \ncreatures rather than to God. But as was shown above (Article [2]), these names \nare applied to God not as the cause only, but also essentially. For the \nwords, \"God is good,\" or \"wise,\" signify not only that He is the cause of \nwisdom or goodness, but that these exist in Him in a more excellent way. \nHence as regards what the name signifies, these names are applied \nprimarily to God rather than to creatures, because these perfections flow \nfrom God to creatures; but as regards the imposition of the names, they \nare primarily applied by us to creatures which we know first. Hence they \nhave a mode of signification which belongs to creatures, as said above \n(Article [3]).",

For if one in \nits idea includes another, and vice versa, then they are simultaneous by \nnature: as double and half, father and son, and the like. But if one in \nits idea includes another, and not vice versa, they are not simultaneous \nby nature. This applies to science and its object; for the object \nknowable is considered as a potentiality, and the science as a habit, or \nas an act. Hence the knowable object in its mode of signification exists \nbefore science, but if the same object is considered in act, then it is \nsimultaneous with science in act; for the object known is nothing as such \nunless it is known. Thus, though God is prior to the creature, still \nbecause the signification of Lord includes the idea of a servant and vice \nversa, these two relative terms, \"Lord\" and \"servant,\" are simultaneous \nby nature.

But this is plainly seen to be false from the \nvery fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and \nhabitude. Nevertheless it is necessary to know that since relation has \ntwo extremes, it happens in three ways that a relation is real or \nlogical. Sometimes from both extremes it is an idea only, as when mutual \norder or habitude can only go between things in the apprehension of \nreason; as when we say a thing \"the same as itself.\" For reason \napprehending one thing twice regards it as two; thus it apprehends a \ncertain habitude of a thing to itself. And the same applies to relations \nbetween \"being\" and \"non-being\" formed by reason, apprehending \n\"non-being\" as an extreme. The same is true of relations that follow upon \nan act of reason, as genus and species, and the like.\nNow there are other relations which are realities as regards both \nextremes, as when for instance a habitude exists between two things \naccording to some reality that belongs to both; as is clear of all \nrelations, consequent upon quantity; as great and small, double and half, \nand the like; for quantity exists in both extremes: and the same applies \nto relations consequent upon action and passion, as motive power and the \nmovable thing, father and son, and the like.\nAgain, sometimes a relation in one extreme may be a reality, while in \nthe other extreme it is an idea only; and this happens whenever two \nextremes are not of one order; as sense and science refer respectively to \nsensible things and to intellectual things; which, inasmuch as they are \nrealities existing in nature, are outside the order of sensible and \nintellectual existence. Therefore in science and in sense a real relation \nexists, because they are ordered either to the knowledge or to the \nsensible perception of things; whereas the things looked at in themselves \nare outside this order, and hence in them there is no real relation to \nscience and sense, but only in idea, inasmuch as the intellect apprehends \nthem as terms of the relations of science and sense. Hence the \nPhilosopher says (Metaph. v) that they are called relative, not forasmuch \nas they are related to other things, but as others are related to them. \nLikewise for instance, \"on the right\" is not applied to a column, unless \nit stands as regards an animal on the right side; which relation is not \nreally in the column, but in the animal.\nSince therefore God is outside the whole order of creation, and all \ncreatures are ordered to Him, and not conversely, it is manifest that \ncreatures are really related to God Himself; whereas in God there is no \nreal relation to creatures, but a relation only in idea, inasmuch as \ncreatures are referred to Him. Thus there is nothing to prevent these \nnames which import relation to the creature from being predicated of God \ntemporally, not by reason of any change in Him, but by reason of the \nchange of the creature; as a column is on the right of an animal, without \nchange in itself, but by change in the animal.",

It is properly communicable in the sense that its whole \nsignification can be given to many; by similitude it is communicable \naccording to some part of the signification of the name. For instance \nthis name \"lion\" is properly communicable to all things of the same \nnature as \"lion\"; by similitude it is communicable to those who \nparticipate in the nature of a lion, as for instance by courage, or \nstrength, and those who thus participate are called lions metaphorically. \nTo know, however, what names are properly communicable, we must consider \nthat every form existing in the singular subject, by which it is \nindividualized, is common to many either in reality, or in idea; as human \nnature is common to many in reality, and in idea; whereas the nature of \nthe sun is not common to many in reality, but only in idea; for the \nnature of the sun can be understood as existing in many subjects; and the \nreason is because the mind understands the nature of every species by \nabstraction from the singular. Hence to be in one singular subject or in \nmany is outside the idea of the nature of the species. So, given the idea \nof a species, it can be understood as existing in many. But the singular, \nfrom the fact that it is singular, is divided off from all others. Hence \nevery name imposed to signify any singular thing is incommunicable both \nin reality and idea; for the plurality of this individual thing cannot \nbe; nor can it be conceived in idea. Hence no name signifying any \nindividual thing is properly communicable to many, but only by way of \nsimilitude; as for instance a person can be called \"Achilles\" \nmetaphorically, forasmuch as he may possess something of the properties \nof Achilles, such as strength. On the other hand, forms  which are \nindividualized not by any \"suppositum,\" but by and of themselves, as \nbeing subsisting forms, if understood as they are in themselves, could \nnot be communicable either in reality or in idea; but only perhaps by way \nof similitude, as was said of individuals. Forasmuch as we are unable to \nunderstand simple self-subsisting forms as they really are, we understand \nthem as compound things having forms in matter; therefore, as was said in \nthe first article, we give them concrete names signifying a nature \nexisting in some \"suppositum.\" Hence, so far as concerns images, the same \nrules apply to names we impose to signify the nature of compound things \nas to names given to us to signify simple subsisting natures.\nSince, then, this name \"God\" is given to signify the divine nature as \nstated above (Article [8]), and since the divine nature cannot be multiplied as \nshown above (Question [11], Article [3]), it follows that this name \"God\" is \nincommunicable in reality, but communicable in opinion; just in the same \nway as this name \"sun\" would be communicable according to the opinion of \nthose who say there are many suns.

To \nprove this we must know that in every true affirmative proposition the \npredicate and the subject signify in some way the same thing in reality, \nand different things in idea. And this appears to be the case both in \npropositions which have an accidental predicate, and in those which have \nan essential predicate. For it is manifest that \"man\" and \"white\" are the \nsame in subject, and different in idea; for the idea of man is one thing, \nand that of whiteness is another. The same applies when I say, \"man is an \nanimal\"; since the same thing which is man is truly animal; for in the \nsame \"suppositum\" there is sensible nature by reason of which he is \ncalled animal, and the rational nature by reason of which he is called \nman; hence here again predicate and subject are the same as to \n\"suppositum,\" but different as to idea. But in propositions where one \nsame thing is predicated of itself, the same rule in some way applies, \ninasmuch as the intellect draws to the \"suppositum\" what it places in the \nsubject; and what it places in the predicate it draws to the nature of \nthe form existing in the \"suppositum\"; according to the saying that \n\"predicates are to be taken formally, and subjects materially.\" To this \ndiversity in idea corresponds the plurality of predicate and subject, \nwhile the intellect signifies the identity of the thing by the  \ncomposition itself.\nGod, however, as considered in Himself, is altogether one and simple, \nyet our intellect knows Him by different conceptions because it cannot \nsee Him as He is in Himself.

But this does not hold in the present \ncase; because our intellect, when forming a proposition about God, does \nnot affirm that He is composite, but that He is simple. But taken as \nreferring to the one who understands, the proposition is false. For the \nmode of the intellect in understanding is different from the mode of the \nthing in its essence. Since it is clear that our intellect understands \nmaterial things below itself in an immaterial manner; not that it \nunderstands them to be immaterial things; but its manner of understanding \nis immaterial.

Now not only what is common to creatures--viz. being---belongs to \ntheir perfection, but also what makes them distinguished from each other; \nas living and understanding, and the like, whereby living beings are \ndistinguished from the non-living, and the intelligent from the \nnon-intelligent. Likewise every form whereby each thing is constituted in \nits own species, is a perfection; and thus all things pre-exist in God, \nnot only as regards what is common to all, but also as regards what \ndistinguishes one thing from another. And therefore as God contains all \nperfections in Himself, the essence of God is compared to all  other \nessences of things, not as the common to the proper, as unity is to \nnumbers, or as the centre (of a circle) to the (radiating) lines; but as \nperfect acts to imperfect; as if I were to compare man to animal; or six, \na perfect number, to the imperfect numbers contained under it. Now it is \nmanifest that by a perfect act imperfect acts can be known not only in \ngeneral, but also by proper knowledge; thus, for example, whoever knows a \nman, knows an animal by proper knowledge; and whoever knows the number \nsix, knows the number three also by proper knowledge.\nAs therefore the essence of God contains in itself all the perfection \ncontained in the essence of any other being, and far more, God can know \nin Himself all of them with proper knowledge. For the nature proper to \neach thing consists in some degree of participation in the divine \nperfection. Now God could not be said to know Himself perfectly unless He \nknew all the ways in which His own perfection can be shared by others. \nNeither could He know the very nature of being perfectly, unless He knew \nall modes of being. Hence it is manifest that God knows all things with \nproper knowledge, in their distinction from each other.",

In one way this adverb \"so\" imports the mode of \nknowledge on the part of the thing known; and in that sense it is false. \nFor the knower does not always know the object known according to the \nexistence it has in the knower; since the eye does not know a stone \naccording to the existence it has in the eye; but by the image of the \nstone which is in the eye, the eye knows the stone according to its \nexistence outside the eye. And if any knower has a knowledge of the \nobject known according to the (mode of) existence it has in the knower, \nthe knower nevertheless knows it according to its (mode of) existence \noutside the knower; thus the intellect knows a stone according to the \nintelligible existence it has in the intellect, inasmuch as it knows that \nit understands; while nevertheless it knows what a stone is in its own \nnature. If however the adverb 'so' be understood to import the mode (of \nknowledge) on the part of the knower, in that sense it is true that only \nthe knower has knowledge of the object known as it is in the knower; for \nthe more perfectly the thing known is in the knower, the more perfect is \nthe mode of knowledge.\nWe must say therefore that God not only knows that all things are in \nHimself; but by the fact that they are in Him, He knows them in their own \nnature and all the more perfectly, the more perfectly each one is in Him.",

The reason is because His \nknowledge is measured by eternity, as is also His being; and eternity \nbeing simultaneously whole comprises all time, as said above (Question [10], Article [2]). Hence all things that are in time are present to God from eternity, \nnot only because He has the types of things present within Him, as some \nsay; but because His glance is carried from eternity over all things as \nthey are in their presentiality. Hence it is manifest that contingent \nthings are infallibly known by God, inasmuch as they are subject to the \ndivine sight in their presentiality; yet they are future contingent \nthings in relation to their own causes.",
        "RP1": "Although the supreme cause is necessary, the effect may be \ncontingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause; just as the \ngermination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate \ncontingent cause, although the movement of the sun which is the first \ncause, is necessary. So likewise things known by God are contingent on \naccount of their proximate causes, while the knowledge of God, which is \nthe first cause, is necessary.",
        "RP2": "Some say that this antecedent, \"God knew this contingent to \nbe future,\" is not necessary, but contingent; because, although it is \npast, still it imports relation to the  future. This however does not \nremove necessity from it; for whatever has had relation to the future, \nmust have had it, although the future sometimes does not follow. On the \nother hand some say that this antecedent is contingent, because it is a \ncompound of necessary and contingent; as this saying is contingent, \n\"Socrates is a white man.\" But this also is to no purpose; for when we \nsay, \"God knew this contingent to be future,\" contingent is used here \nonly as the matter of the word, and not as the chief part of the \nproposition. Hence its contingency or necessity has no reference to the \nnecessity or contingency of the proposition, or to its being true or \nfalse. For it may be just as true that I said a man is an ass, as that I \nsaid Socrates runs, or God is: and the same applies to necessary and \ncontingent. Hence it must be said that this antecedent is absolutely \nnecessary. Nor does it follow, as some say, that the consequent is \nabsolutely necessary, because the antecedent is the remote cause of the \nconsequent, which is contingent by reason of the proximate cause. But \nthis is to no purpose. For the conditional would be false were its \nantecedent the remote necessary cause, and the consequent a contingent \neffect; as, for example, if I said, \"if the sun moves, the grass will \ngrow.\"\nTherefore we must reply otherwise; that when the antecedent contains \nanything belonging to an act of the soul, the consequent must be taken \nnot as it is in itself, but as it is in the soul: for the existence of a \nthing in itself is different from the existence of a thing in the soul. \nFor example, when I say, \"What the soul understands is immaterial,\" this \nis to be understood that it is immaterial as it is in the intellect, not \nas it is in itself. Likewise if I say, \"If God knew anything, it will \nbe,\" the consequent must be understood as it is subject to the divine \nknowledge, i.e. as it is in its presentiality. And thus it is necessary, \nas also is the antecedent: \"For everything that is, while it is, must be \nnecessarily be,\" as the Philosopher says in Peri Herm. i.",
        "RP3": "Things reduced to act in time, as known by us successively \nin time, but by God (are known) in eternity, which is above time. Whence \nto us they cannot be certain, forasmuch as we know future contingent \nthings as such; but (they are certain) to God alone, whose understanding \nis in eternity above time. Just as he who goes along the road, does not \nsee those who come after him; whereas he who sees the whole road from a \nheight, sees at once all travelling by the way. Hence what is known by us \nmust be necessary, even as it is in itself; for what is future contingent \nin itself, cannot be known by us. Whereas what is known by God must be \nnecessary according to the mode in which they are subject to the divine \nknowledge, as already stated, but not absolutely as considered in their \nown causes. Hence also this proposition, \"Everything known by God must \nnecessarily be,\" is usually distinguished; for this may refer to the \nthing, or to the saying. If it refers to the thing, it is divided and \nfalse; for the sense is, \"Everything which God knows is necessary.\" If \nunderstood of the saying, it is composite and true; for the sense is, \n\"This proposition, 'that which is known by God is' is necessary.\"\nNow some urge an objection and say that this distinction holds good with \nregard to forms that are separable from the subject; thus if I said, \"It \nis possible for a white thing to be black,\" it is false as applied to the \nsaying, and true as applied to the thing: for a thing which is white, can \nbecome black; whereas this saying, \" a white thing is black\" can never be \ntrue. But in forms that are inseparable from the subject, this \ndistinction does not hold, for instance, if I said, \"A black crow can be \nwhite\"; for in both senses it is false. Now to be known by God is \ninseparable from the thing; for what is known by God cannot be known. \nThis objection, however, would hold if these words \"that which is known\" \nimplied any disposition inherent to the subject; but since they import an \nact of the knower, something can be attributed to the thing known, in \nitself (even if it always be known), which is not attributed to it in so \nfar as it stands under actual knowledge; thus material existence is \nattributed to a stone in itself, which is not attributed to it inasmuch \nas it is known."

Therefore, \nit must be conceded that this proposition is not true, \"Whatever God knew \nHe knows,\" if referred to enunciable propositions. But because of this, \nit does not follow that the knowledge of God is variable.

In proof \nwhereof it must be observed that knowledge can be called speculative in \nthree ways: first, on the part of the things known, which are not \noperable by the knower; such is the knowledge of man about natural or \ndivine thing. Secondly, as regards the manner of knowing---as, for \ninstance, if a builder consider a house by defining and dividing, and \nconsidering what belongs to it in general: for this is to consider \noperable things in a speculative manner, and not as practically operable; \nfor operable means the application of form to matter, and not the \nresolution of the composite into its universal formal principles. \nThirdly, as regards the end; \"for the practical intellect differs in its \nend from the speculative,\" as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii). For \nthe practical intellect is ordered to the end of the operation; whereas \nthe end of the speculative intellect is the consideration of truth. Hence \nif a builder should consider how a house can be made, not ordering this \nto the end of operation, but only to know (how to do it), this would be \nonly a speculative considerations as regards the end, although it \nconcerns an operable thing. Therefore knowledge which is speculative by \nreason of the thing itself known, is merely speculative. But that which \nis speculative either in its mode or as to its end is partly speculative \nand partly practical: and when it is ordained to an operative end it is \nsimply practical.\nIn accordance with this, therefore, it must be said that God has of \nHimself a speculative knowledge only; for He Himself is not operable. But \nof all other things He has both speculative and practical knowledge. He \nhas speculative knowledge as regards the mode; for whatever we know \nspeculatively in things by defining and dividing, God knows all this much \nmore perfectly.\nNow of things which He can make, but does not make at any time, He has \nnot a practical knowledge, according as knowledge is called practical \nfrom the end. But He has a practical knowledge of what He makes in some \nperiod of time. And, as regards evil things, although they are not \noperable by Him, yet they fall under His practical knowledge, like good \nthings, inasmuch as He permits, or impedes, or directs them; as also \nsicknesses fall under the practical knowledge of the physician, inasmuch \nas he cures them by his art.",

Therefore, since the knowledge of God is in \nevery way perfect, He must know what is operable by Him, formally as \nsuch, and not only in so far as they are speculative.

For Augustine (Soliloq. ii, 5) condemns this definition \nof truth, \"That is true which is seen\"; since it would follow that stones \nhidden in the bosom of the earth would not be true stones, as they are \nnot seen. He also condemns the following, \"That is true which is as it \nappears to the knower, who is willing and able to know,\" for hence it \nwould follow that nothing would be true, unless someone could know it. \nTherefore he defines truth thus: \"That is true which is.\" It seems, then, \nthat truth resides in things, and not in the intellect.",

Therefore truth \nresides rather in things than in the intellect.",

        "ANS": "As the good denotes that towards which the appetite \ntends, so the true denotes that towards which the intellect tends. Now \nthere is this difference between the appetite and the intellect, or any \nknowledge whatsoever, that knowledge is according as the thing known is \nin the knower, whilst appetite is according as the desirer tends towards \nthe thing desired. Thus the term of the appetite, namely good, is in the \nobject desirable, and the term of the intellect, namely true, is in the \nintellect itself. Now as good exists in a thing so far as that thing is \nrelated to the appetite---and hence the aspect of goodness passes on from \nthe desirable thing to the appetite, in so far as the appetite is called \ngood if its object is good; so, since the true is in the intellect in so \nfar as it is conformed to the object understood, the aspect of the true \nmust needs pass from the intellect to the object understood, so that also \nthe thing understood is said to be true in so far as it has some relation \nto the intellect. Now a thing understood may be in relation to an \nintellect either essentially or accidentally. It is related essentially \nto an intellect on which it depends as regards its essence; but \naccidentally to an intellect by which it is knowable; even as we may say \nthat a house is related essentially to the intellect of the architect, \nbut accidentally to the intellect upon which it does not depend.\nNow we do not judge of a thing by what is in it accidentally, but by \nwhat is in it essentially. Hence, everything is said to be true \nabsolutely, in so far as it is related to the intellect from which it \ndepends; and thus it is that artificial things are said to be true a \nbeing related to our intellect. For a house is said to be true that \nexpresses the likeness of the form in the architect's mind; and words are \nsaid to be true so far as they are the signs of truth in the intellect. \nIn the same way natural things are said to be true in so far as they \nexpress the likeness of the species that are in the divine mind. For a \nstone is called true, which possesses the nature proper to a stone, \naccording to the preconception in the divine intellect. Thus, then, truth \nresides primarily in the intellect, and secondarily in things according \nas they are related to the intellect as their principle. Consequently \nthere are various definitions of truth. Augustine says (De Vera Relig. \nxxxvi), \"Truth is that whereby is made manifest that which is;\" and \nHilary says (De Trin. v) that \"Truth makes being clear and evident\" and \nthis pertains to truth according as it is in the intellect. As to the \ntruth of things in so far as they are related to the intellect, we have \nAugustine's definition (De Vera Relig. xxxvi), \"Truth is a supreme \nlikeness without any unlikeness to a principle\": also Anselm's definition \n(De Verit. xii), \"Truth is rightness, perceptible by the mind alone\"; for \nthat is right which is in accordance with the principle; also Avicenna's \ndefinition (Metaph. viii, 6), \"The truth of each thing is a property of \nthe essence which is immutably attached to it.\" The definition that \n\"Truth is the equation of thought and thing\" is applicable to it under \neither aspect.",

For although sight has \nthe likeness of a visible thing, yet  it does not know the comparison \nwhich exists between the thing seen and that which itself apprehends \nconcerning it.

        "CON": "Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 34): \"Every body is a \ntrue body and a false unity: for it imitates unity without being unity.\" \nBut everything imitates the divine unity yet falls short of it. Therefore \nin all things falsity exists.",
        "ANS": "Since true and false are opposed, and since opposites \nstand in relation to the same thing, we must needs seek falsity, where \nprimarily we find truth; that is to say, in the intellect. Now, in \nthings, neither truth nor falsity exists, except in relation to the \nintellect. And since every thing is denominated simply by what belongs to \nit \"per se,\" but is denominated relatively by what belongs to it \naccidentally; a thing indeed may be called false simply when compared \nwith the intellect on which it depends, and to which it is compared \"per \nse\" but may be called false relatively as directed to another intellect, \nto which it is compared accidentally. Now natural things depend on the \ndivine intellect, as artificial things on the human. Wherefore artificial \nthings are said to be false simply and in themselves, in so far as they \nfall short of the form of the art; whence a craftsman is said to produce \na false work, if it falls short of the proper operation of his art.\nIn things that depend on God, falseness cannot be found, in so far as \nthey are compared with the divine intellect; since whatever takes place \nin things proceeds from the ordinance of that intellect, unless perhaps \nin the case of voluntary agents only, who  have it in their power to \nwithdraw themselves from what is so ordained; wherein consists the evil \nof sin. Thus sins themselves are called untruths and lies in the \nScriptures, according to the words of the text, \"Why do you love vanity, \nand seek after lying?\" (Ps. 4:3): as on the other hand virtuous deeds are \ncalled the \"truth of life\" as being obedient to the order of the divine \nintellect. Thus it is said, \"He that doth truth, cometh to the light\" \n(Jn. 3:21).\nBut in relation to our intellect, natural things which are compared \nthereto accidentally, can be called false; not simply, but relatively; \nand that in two ways. In one way according to the thing signified, and \nthus a thing is said to be false as being signified or represented by \nword or thought that is false. In this respect anything can be said to be \nfalse as regards any quality not possessed by it; as if we should say \nthat a diameter is a false commensurable thing, as the Philosopher says \n(Metaph. v, 34). So, too, Augustine says (Soliloq. ii, 10): \"The true \ntragedian is a false Hector\": even as, on the contrary, anything can be \ncalled true, in regard to that which is becoming to it. In another way a \nthing can be called false, by way of cause---and thus a thing is said to \nbe false that naturally begets a false opinion. And whereas it is innate \nin us to judge things by external appearances, since our knowledge takes \nits rise from sense, which principally and naturally deals with external \naccidents, therefore those external accidents, which resemble things \nother than themselves, are said to be false with respect to those things; \nthus gall is falsely honey; and tin, false gold. Regarding this, \nAugustine says (Soliloq. ii, 6): \"We call those things false that appear \nto our apprehension like the true:\" and the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, \n34): \"Things are called false that are naturally apt to appear such as \nthey are not, or what they are not.\" In this way a man is called false as \ndelighting in false opinions or words, and not because he can invent \nthem; for in this way many wise and learned persons might be called \nfalse, as stated in Metaph. v, 34.",

Hence a thing is not always said to \nbe false, because it resembles another thing; but only when the \nresemblance is such as naturally to produce a false opinion, not in any \none case, but in the majority of instances."

In the first way, primarily and of its own \nnature, as in sight there is the likeness of colors, and of other \nsensible objects proper to it. Secondly, of its own nature, though not \nprimarily; as in sight there is the likeness of shape, size, and of other \nsensible objects common to more than one sense. Thirdly, neither \nprimarily nor of its own nature, but accidentally, as in sight, there is \nthe likeness of a man, not as man, but in so far as it is accidental to \nthe colored object to be a man.\nSense, then, has no false knowledge about its proper objects, except \naccidentally and rarely, and then, because of the unsound organ it does \nnot receive the sensible form rightly; just as other passive subjects \nbecause of their indisposition receive defectively the impressions of the \nagent.

Hence, \nas natural things cannot fall short of the being that belongs to them by \ntheir form, but may fall short of accidental or consequent qualities, \neven as a man may fail to possess two feet, but not fail to be a man; so \nthe faculty of knowing cannot fail in knowledge of the thing with the \nlikeness of which it is informed; but may fail with regard to something \nconsequent upon that form, or accidental thereto. For it has been said \n(Article [2]) that sight is not  deceived in its proper sensible, but about \ncommon sensibles that are consequent to that object; or about accidental \nobjects of sense. Now as the sense is directly informed by the likeness \nof its proper object, so is the intellect by the likeness of the essence \nof a thing. Hence the intellect is not deceived about the essence of a \nthing, as neither the sense about its proper object. But in affirming and \ndenying, the intellect may be deceived, by attributing to the thing of \nwhich it understands the essence, something which is not consequent upon \nit, or is opposed to it. For the intellect is in the same position as \nregards judging of such things, as sense is as to judging of common, or \naccidental, sensible objects.

In another \nway, by composing a definition of parts which are mutually exclusive. For \nthus the definition is not only false of the thing, but false in itself. \nA definition such as \" a reasonable four-footed animal\" would be of this \nkind, and the intellect false in making it; for such a statement as \"some \nreasonable animals are four-footed\" is false in itself.

In proof \nof which it must be considered that since a thing is said to live in so \nfar as it operates of itself and not as moved by another, the more \nperfectly this power is found in anything, the more perfect is the life \nof that thing. In things that move and are moved, a threefold order is \nfound. In the first place, the end moves the agent: and the principal \nagent is that which acts through  its form, and sometimes it does so \nthrough some instrument that acts by virtue not of its own form, but of \nthe principal agent, and does no more than execute the action. \nAccordingly there are things that move themselves, not in respect of any \nform or end naturally inherent in them, but only in respect of the \nexecuting of the movement; the form by which they act, and the end of the \naction being alike determined for them by their nature. Of this kind are \nplants, which move themselves according to their inherent nature, with \nregard only to executing the movements of growth and decay.\nOther things have self-movement in a higher degree, that is, not only \nwith regard to executing the movement, but even as regards to the form, \nthe principle of movement, which form they acquire of themselves. Of this \nkind are animals, in which the principle of movement is not a naturally \nimplanted form; but one received through sense. Hence the more perfect is \ntheir sense, the more perfect is their power of self-movement. Such as \nhave only the sense of touch, as shellfish, move only with the motion of \nexpansion and contraction; and thus their movement hardly exceeds that of \nplants. Whereas such as have the sensitive power in perfection, so as to \nrecognize not only connection and touch, but also objects apart from \nthemselves, can move themselves to a distance by progressive movement. \nYet although animals of the latter kind receive through sense the form \nthat is the principle of their movement, nevertheless they cannot of \nthemselves propose to themselves the end of their operation, or movement; \nfor this has been implanted in them by nature; and by natural instinct \nthey are moved to any action through the form apprehended by sense. Hence \nsuch animals as move themselves in respect to an end they themselves \npropose are superior to these. This can only be done by reason and \nintellect; whose province it is to know the proportion between the end \nand the means to that end, and duly coordinate them. Hence a more perfect \ndegree of life is that of intelligible beings; for their power of \nself-movement is more perfect. This is shown by the fact that in one and \nthe same man the intellectual faculty moves the sensitive powers; and \nthese by their command move the organs of movement. Thus in the arts we \nsee that the art of using a ship, i.e. the art of navigation, rules the \nart of ship-designing; and this in its turn rules the art that is only \nconcerned with preparing the material for the ship.\nBut although our intellect moves itself to some things, yet others are \nsupplied by nature, as are first principles, which it cannot doubt; and \nthe last end, which it cannot but will. Hence, although with respect to \nsome things it moves itself, yet with regard to other things it must be \nmoved by another. Wherefore that being whose act of understanding is its \nvery nature, and which, in what it naturally possesses, is not determined \nby another, must have life in the most perfect degree. Such is God; and \nhence in Him principally is life. From this the Philosopher concludes \n(Metaph. xii, 51), after showing God to be intelligent, that God has life \nmost perfect and eternal, since His intellect is most perfect and always \nin act.",

The difference between them is this, that the former action \nis the perfection not of the agent that moves, but of the thing moved; \nwhereas the latter action is the perfection of the agent. Hence, because \nmovement is an act of the thing in movement, the latter action, in so far \nas it is the act of the operator, is called its movement, by this \nsimilitude, that as movement is an act of the thing moved, so an act of \nthis kind is the act of the agent, although movement is an act of the \nimperfect, that is, of what is in potentiality; while this kind of act is \nan act of the perfect, that is to say, of what is in act as stated in De \nAnima iii, 28. In the sense, therefore, in which understanding is \nmovement, that which understands itself is said to move itself. It is in \nthis sense that Plato also taught that God moves Himself; not in the \nsense in which movement is an act of the imperfect.",

It is the same when the \nsubject forms part of the notion of the predicate; thus it is absolutely \nnecessary that a number must be odd or even. In this way it is not \nnecessary that Socrates sits: wherefore it is not necessary absolutely, \nthough it may be so by supposition; for, granted that he is sitting, he \nmust necessarily sit, as long as he is sitting. Accordingly as to things \nwilled by God, we must observe that He wills something of absolute \nnecessity: but this is not true of all that He wills. For the divine will \nhas a necessary relation to the divine goodness, since that is its proper \nobject.

But God wills things apart \nfrom Himself in so far as they are ordered to His own goodness as their \nend. Now in willing an end we do not necessarily will things that conduce \nto it, unless they are such that the end cannot be attained without them; \nas, we will to take food to preserve life, or to take ship in order to \ncross the sea. But we do not necessarily will things without which the \nend is attainable, such as a horse for a journey which we can take on \nfoot, for we can make the journey without one. The same applies to other \nmeans. Hence, since the goodness of God is perfect, and can exist without \nother things inasmuch as no perfection can accrue to Him from them, it \nfollows that His willing things apart from Himself is not absolutely \nnecessary.

Since both intellect and nature act for an end, as proved in \nPhys. ii, 49, the natural agent must have the end and the necessary means \npredetermined for it by some higher intellect; as the end and definite \nmovement is predetermined for the arrow by the archer.

Hence, since God is first in the order of agents, He must act by \nintellect and will.\nThis is shown, secondly, from the character of a natural agent, of which \nthe property is to produce one and the same effect; for nature operates \nin one and the same way unless it be prevented. This is because the \nnature of the act is according to the nature of the agent; and hence as \nlong as it has that nature, its acts will be in accordance with that \nnature; for every natural agent has a determinate being. Since, then, the \nDivine Being is undetermined, and contains in Himself the full perfection \nof being, it cannot be that He acts by a necessity of His nature, unless \nHe were to cause something undetermined and indefinite in being: and that \nthis is impossible has been already shown (Question [7], Article [2]). He does not, \ntherefore, act by a necessity of His nature, but determined effects \nproceed from His own infinite perfection according to the determination \nof His will and intellect.\nThirdly, it is shown by the relation of effects to their cause. For \neffects proceed from the agent that causes them, in so far as they \npre-exist in the agent; since every agent produces its like. Now effects \npre-exist in their cause after the mode of the cause. Wherefore since the \nDivine Being is His own intellect, effects pre-exist in Him after the \nmode of intellect, and therefore proceed from Him after the same mode. \nConsequently, they proceed from Him after the mode of will, for His \ninclination to put in act what His intellect has conceived appertains to \nthe will.

        "OB3": "Further, since the will of God is the first cause, it does not \nexclude intermediate causes. But the effect of a first cause may be \nhindered by a defect of a secondary cause; as the effect of the motive \npower may be hindered by the weakness of the  limb. Therefore the effect \nof the divine will may be hindered by a defect of the secondary causes. \nThe will of God, therefore, is not always fulfilled.",
        "CON": "It is said (Ps. 113:11): \"God hath done all things, \nwhatsoever He would.\"",
        "ANS": "The will of God must needs always be fulfilled. In proof \nof which we must consider that since an effect is conformed to the agent \naccording to its form, the rule is the same with active causes as with \nformal causes. The rule in forms is this: that although a thing may fall \nshort of any particular form, it cannot fall short of the universal form. \nFor though a thing may fail to be, for example, a man or a living being, \nyet it cannot fail to be a being. Hence the same must happen in active \ncauses. Something may fall outside the order of any particular active \ncause, but not outside the order of the universal cause; under which all \nparticular causes are included: and if any particular cause fails of its \neffect, this is because of the hindrance of some other particular cause, \nwhich is included in the order of the universal cause. Therefore an \neffect cannot possibly escape the order of the universal cause. Even in \ncorporeal things this is clearly seen. For it may happen that a star is \nhindered from producing its effects; yet whatever effect does result, in \ncorporeal things, from this hindrance of a corporeal cause, must be \nreferred through intermediate causes to the universal influence of the \nfirst heaven. Since, then, the will of God is the universal cause of all \nthings, it is impossible that the divine will should not produce its \neffect. Hence that which seems to depart from the divine will in one \norder, returns into it in another order; as does the sinner, who by sin \nfalls away from the divine will as much as lies in him, yet falls back \ninto the order of that will, when by its justice he is punished.",
        "RP1": "The words of the Apostle, \"God will have all men to be \nsaved,\" etc. can be understood in three ways. First, by a restricted \napplication, in which case they would mean, as Augustine says (De praed. \nsanct. i, 8: Enchiridion 103), \"God wills all men to be saved that are \nsaved, not because there is no man whom He does not wish saved, but \nbecause there is no man saved whose salvation He does not will.\" \nSecondly, they can be understood as applying to every class of \nindividuals, not to every individual of each class; in which case they \nmean that God wills some men of every class and condition to be saved, \nmales and females, Jews and Gentiles, great and small, but not all of \nevery condition. Thirdly, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 29), \nthey are understood of the antecedent will of God; not of the consequent \nwill. This distinction must not be taken as applying to the divine will \nitself, in which there is nothing antecedent nor consequent, but to the \nthings willed.\nTo understand this we must consider that everything, in so far as it is \ngood, is willed by God. A thing taken in its primary sense, and \nabsolutely considered, may be good or evil, and yet when  some additional \ncircumstances are taken into account, by a consequent consideration may \nbe changed into the contrary. Thus that a man should live is good; and \nthat a man should be killed is evil, absolutely considered. But if in a \nparticular case we add that a man is a murderer or dangerous to society, \nto kill him is a good; that he live is an evil. Hence it may be said of a \njust judge, that antecedently he wills all men to live; but consequently \nwills the murderer to be hanged. In the same way God antecedently wills \nall men to be saved, but consequently wills some to be damned, as His \njustice exacts. Nor do we will simply, what we will antecedently, but \nrather we will it in a qualified manner; for the will is directed to \nthings as they are in themselves, and in themselves they exist under \nparticular qualifications. Hence we will a thing simply inasmuch as we \nwill it when all particular circumstances are considered; and this is \nwhat is meant by willing consequently. Thus it may be said that a just \njudge wills simply the hanging of a murderer, but in a qualified manner \nhe would will him to live, to wit, inasmuch as he is a man. Such a \nqualified will may be called a willingness rather than an absolute will. \nThus it is clear that whatever God simply wills takes place; although \nwhat He wills antecedently may not take place.",

This cannot happen, unless we presuppose change \neither in the knowledge or in the disposition of the substance of the \nwiller. For since the will regards good, a man may in two ways begin to \nwill a thing. In one way when that thing begins to be good for him, and \nthis does not take place without a change in him. Thus when the cold \nweather begins, it becomes good to sit by the fire; though it was not so \nbefore.

Thus in the \ncase of the raising of Lazarus, one who looked only on inferior causes \nmight have said: \"Lazarus will not rise again,\" but looking at the divine \nfirst cause might have said: \"Lazarus will rise again.\" And God wills \nboth: that is, that in the order of the inferior cause a thing shall \nhappen; but that in the order of the higher cause it shall not happen; or \nHe may will conversely. We may say, then, that God sometimes declares \nthat a thing shall happen according as it falls under the order of  \ninferior causes, as of nature, or merit, which yet does not happen as not \nbeing in the designs of the divine and higher cause. Thus He foretold to \nEzechias: \"Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live\" \n(Is. 38:1). Yet this did not take place, since from eternity it was \notherwise disposed in the divine knowledge and will, which is \nunchangeable.

The reason of this some have chosen to assign to \nintermediate causes, holding that what God produces by necessary causes \nis necessary; and what He produces by contingent causes contingent.\nThis does not seem to be a sufficient explanation, for two reasons. \nFirst, because the effect of a first cause is contingent on account of \nthe secondary cause, from the fact that the effect of the first cause is \nhindered by deficiency in the second cause, as the sun's power is \nhindered by a defect in the plant. But no defect of a secondary cause can \nhinder God's will from producing its effect. Secondly, because if the \ndistinction between the contingent and the necessary is to be referred \nonly to secondary causes, this must be independent of the divine \nintention and will; which is inadmissible. It is better therefore to say \nthat this happens on account of the efficacy of the divine will.

Thus from defect of active power in the seed it may happen that a \nchild is born unlike its father in accidental points, that belong to its \nmanner of being. Since then the divine will is perfectly efficacious, it \nfollows not only that things are done, which God wills to be done, but \nalso that they are done in the way that He wills. Now God wills some \nthings to be done necessarily, some contingently, to the right ordering \nof things, for the building up of the universe. Therefore to some effects \nHe has attached necessary causes, that cannot fail; but to others \ndefectible and contingent causes, from which arise contingent effects. \nHence it is not because the proximate causes are contingent that the \neffects willed by God happen contingently, but because God prepared \ncontingent causes for them, it being His will that they should happen \ncontingently.",

        "CON": "It is written: \"God is love\" (Jn. 4:16).",
        "ANS": "We must needs assert that in God there is love: because \nlove is the first movement of the will and of every appetitive faculty. \nFor since the acts of the will and of every appetitive faculty tend \ntowards good and evil, as to their proper objects: and since good is \nessentially and especially the object of the will and the appetite, \nwhereas evil is only the object secondarily and indirectly, as opposed to \ngood; it follows that the acts of the will and appetite that regard good \nmust naturally be prior to those that regard evil; thus, for instance, \njoy is prior to sorrow, love to hate: because what exists of itself is \nalways prior to that which exists through another. Again, the more \nuniversal is naturally prior to what is less so. Hence the intellect is \nfirst directed to universal truth; and in the second place to particular \nand special truths. Now there are certain acts of the will and appetite \nthat regard good under some special condition, as joy and delight regard \ngood present and possessed; whereas desire and hope regard good not as \nyet possessed. Love, however, regards good universally, whether possessed \nor not. Hence love is naturally the first act of the will and appetite; \nfor which reason all the other appetite movements presuppose love, as \ntheir root and origin. For nobody desires anything nor rejoices in \nanything, except as a good that is loved: nor is anything an object of \nhate except as opposed to the object of love. Similarly, it is clear that \nsorrow, and other things like to it, must be referred to love as to their \nfirst principle. Hence, in whomsoever there is will and appetite, there \nmust also be love: since if the first is wanting, all that follows is \nalso wanting. Now it has been shown that will is in God (Question [19], Article [1]), \nand hence we must attribute love to Him.",

Hence, in \nus the sensitive appetite is the proximate motive-force of our bodies. \nSome bodily change therefore always accompanies an act of the sensitive \nappetite, and this change affects especially the heart, which, as the \nPhilosopher says (De part. animal. iii, 4), is the first principle of \nmovement in animals. Therefore acts of the sensitive appetite, inasmuch \nas they have annexed to them some bodily change, are called passions; \nwhereas acts of the will are not so called. Love, therefore, and joy and \ndelight are passions; in so far as they denote acts of the intellective \nappetite, they are not passions. It is in this latter sense that they are \nin God. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii): \"God rejoices by an \noperation that is one and simple,\" and for the same reason He loves \nwithout passion.",
        "RP2": "In the passions of the sensitive appetite there may be \ndistinguished a certain material element---namely, the bodily \nchange---and a certain formal element, which is on the part of the \nappetite. Thus in anger, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, \n15,63,64), the material element is the kindling of the blood about the \nheart; but the formal, the appetite for revenge. Again, as regards the \nformal element of certain passions a certain imperfection is implied, as \nin desire, which is of the good we have not, and in sorrow, which is \nabout the evil we have. This applies also to anger, which supposes \nsorrow. Certain other passions, however, as love and joy, imply no \nimperfection. Since therefore none of these can be attributed to God on \ntheir material side, as has been said (ad 1); neither can those that even \non their formal side imply imperfection be attributed to Him; except \nmetaphorically, and from likeness of effects, as already show (Question [3], Article [2], ad 2; Question [19], Article [11]). Whereas, those that do not imply imperfection, \nsuch as love and joy, can be properly predicated of God, though without \nattributing passion to Him, as said before (Question [19], Article [11]).",
        "RP3": "An act of love always tends towards two things; to the good \nthat one wills, and to the person for whom one wills it: since to love a \nperson is to wish that person good. Hence, inasmuch as we love ourselves, \nwe wish ourselves good; and, so far as possible, union with that good. So \nlove is called the unitive force, even in God, yet without implying \ncomposition; for the good that He wills for Himself, is no other than \nHimself, Who is good by His essence, as above shown (Question [6], Articles [1],3). And \nby the fact that anyone loves another, he wills good to that other. Thus \nhe puts the other, as it were, in the place of himself; and regards the \ngood done to him as done to himself. So far love is a binding force, \nsince it aggregates another to ourselves, and refers his good to our own. \nAnd then again the divine love is a binding force, inasmuch as God wills \ngood to others; yet it implies no composition in God."

Now a twofold order has to be \nconsidered in things: the one, whereby one created thing is directed to \nanother, as the parts of the whole, accident to substance, and all things \nwhatsoever to their end; the other, whereby all created things are \nordered to God. Thus in the divine operations debt may be regarded in two \nways, as due either to God, or to creatures, and in either way God pays \nwhat is due. It is due to God that there should be fulfilled in creatures \nwhat His will and wisdom require, and what manifests His goodness. In \nthis respect, God's justice regards what befits Him; inasmuch as He \nrenders to Himself what is due to Himself. It is also due to a created \nthing that it should possess what is ordered to it; thus it is due to man \nto have hands, and that other animals should serve him. Thus also God \nexercises justice, when He gives to each thing what is due to it by its \nnature and condition. This debt however is derived from the former; since \nwhat is due to each thing is due to it as ordered to it according to the \ndivine wisdom.

In proof of which it must \nbe considered that a person is said to be merciful [misericors], as \nbeing, so to speak, sorrowful at heart [miserum cor]; being affected with \nsorrow at the misery of another as though it were his own. Hence it \nfollows that he endeavors to dispel the misery of this other, as if it \nwere his; and this is the effect of mercy. To sorrow, therefore, over the \nmisery of others belongs not to God; but it does most properly belong to \nHim to dispel that misery, whatever be the defect we call by that name. \nNow defects are not removed, except by the perfection of some kind of \ngoodness; and the primary source of goodness is God, as shown above (Question [6], Article [4]). It must, however, be considered that to bestow perfections \nappertains not only to the divine goodness, but also to His justice, \nliberality, and mercy; yet under different aspects. The communicating of \nperfections, absolutely considered, appertains to goodness, as shown \nabove (Question [6], Articles [1],4); in so far as perfections are given to things in \nproportion, the bestowal of them belongs to justice, as has been already \nsaid (Article [1]); in so far as God does not bestow them for His own use, but \nonly on account of His goodness, it belongs to liberality; in so far as \nperfections given to things by God expel defects, it belongs to mercy.",

        "RP2": "God acts mercifully, not indeed by going against His \njustice, but by doing something more than justice; thus a man who pays \nanother two hundred pieces of money, though owing him only one hundred, \ndoes nothing against justice, but acts liberally or mercifully.

Hence the Apostle calls \nremission a forgiving: \"Forgive one another, as Christ has forgiven you\" \n(Eph. 4:32).

        "ANS": "Mercy and truth are necessarily found in all God's works, \nif mercy be taken to mean the removal of any kind of defect. Not every \ndefect, however, can properly be called a misery; but only defect in a \nrational nature whose lot is to be happy; for misery is opposed to \nhappiness. For this necessity there is a reason, because since a debt \npaid according to the divine justice is one due either to God, or to some \ncreature, neither the one nor the other can be lacking in any work of \nGod: because God can do nothing that is not in accord with His wisdom and \ngoodness; and it is in this sense, as we have said, that anything is due \nto God. Likewise, whatever is done by Him in created things, is done \naccording to proper order and proportion wherein consists the idea of \njustice. Thus justice must exist in all God's works. Now the work of \ndivine justice always presupposes the work of mercy; and is founded \nthereupon. For nothing is due to creatures, except for something \npre-existing in them, or foreknown. Again, if this is due to a creature, \nit must be due on account of something that precedes. And since we cannot \ngo on to infinity, we must come to something that depends only on the \ngoodness of the divine will---which is the ultimate end. We may say, for \ninstance, that to possess hands is due to man on account of his rational \nsoul; and his rational soul is due to him that he may be man; and his \nbeing man is on account of the divine goodness. So in every work of God, \nviewed at its primary source, there appears mercy. In all that follows, \nthe power of mercy remains, and works indeed with even greater force; as \nthe influence of the first cause is more intense than that of second \ncauses. For this reason does God out of abundance of His goodness bestow \nupon creatures what is due to them more bountifully than is proportionate \nto their deserts: since less would suffice for preserving the order of \njustice than what the divine goodness confers; because between creatures \nand God's goodness there can be no proportion.",

Even in the damnation of the reprobate mercy is seen, which, \nthough it does not totally remit, yet somewhat alleviates, in punishing \nshort of what is deserved.\nIn the justification of the ungodly, justice is seen, when God remits \nsins on account of love, though He Himself has mercifully infused that \nlove. So we read of Magdalen: \"Many sins are forgiven her, because she \nhath loved much\" (Lk. 7:47).",

        "ANS": "It is necessary to attribute providence to God. For all \nthe good that is in created things has been created by God, as was shown \nabove (Question [6], Article [4]). In created things good is found not only as regards \ntheir substance, but also as regards their order towards an end and \nespecially their last end, which, as was said above, is the divine \ngoodness (Question [21], Article [4]). This good of order existing in things created, is \nitself created by God. Since, however, God is the cause of things by His \nintellect, and thus it behooves that the type of every effect should \npre-exist in Him, as is clear from what has gone before (Question [19], Article [4]), it \nis necessary that the type of the order of things towards their end \nshould pre-exist in the divine mind: and the type of things ordered \ntowards an end is, properly speaking, providence. For it is the chief \npart of prudence, to which two other parts are directed---namely, \nremembrance of the past, and understanding of the present; inasmuch as \nfrom the remembrance of what is past and the understanding of what is \npresent, we gather how to provide for the future. Now it belongs to \nprudence, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 12), to direct other \nthings towards an end whether in regard to oneself---as for instance, a \nman is said to be prudent, who orders well his acts towards the end of \nlife--or in regard to others subject to him, in a family, city or \nkingdom; in which sense it is said (Mt. 24:45), \"a faithful and wise \nservant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family.\" In this way \nprudence or providence may suitably be attributed to God. For in God \nHimself there can be nothing ordered towards an end, since He is the last \nend. This type of order in things towards an end is therefore in God \ncalled providence. Whence Boethius says (De Consol. iv, 6) that \n\"Providence is the divine type itself, seated in the Supreme Ruler; which \ndisposeth all things\": which disposition may refer either to the type of \nthe order of things towards an end, or to the type of the order of parts \nin the whole.",

Whence, \nthough to take counsel may not be fitting to God, from the fact that \ncounsel is an inquiry into matters that are doubtful,  nevertheless to \ngive a command as to the ordering of things towards an end, the right \nreason of which He possesses, does belong to God, according to Ps. 148:6: \n\"He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away.\" In this manner both \nprudence and providence belong to God. Although at the same time it may \nbe said that the very reason of things to be done is called counsel in \nGod; not because of any inquiry necessitated, but from the certitude of \nthe knowledge, to which those who take counsel come by inquiry. Whence it \nis said: \"Who worketh all things according to the counsel of His will\" \n(Eph. 1:11).",

In this way, the Apostle \nwithdraws oxen from the care of God: not, however, that individual \nirrational creatures escape the care of divine providence; as was the \nopinion of the Rabbi Moses.",

        "ANS": "Certain persons totally denied the existence of \nprovidence, as Democritus and the Epicureans, maintaining that the world \nwas made by chance. Others taught that incorruptible things only were \nsubject to providence and corruptible things not in their individual \nselves, but only according to their species; for in this respect they are \nincorruptible. They are represented as saying (Job 22:14): \"The clouds \nare His covert; and He doth not consider our things; and He walketh about \nthe poles of heaven.\" Rabbi Moses, however, excluded men from the \ngenerality of things corruptible, on account of the excellence of the \nintellect which they possess, but in reference to all else that suffers \ncorruption he adhered to the opinion of the others.\nWe must say, however, that all things are subject to divine providence, \nnot only in general, but even in their own individual selves. This is mad \nevident thus. For since every agent acts for an end, the ordering of \neffects towards that end extends as far as the causality of the first \nagent extends. Whence it happens that in the effects of an agent \nsomething takes place which has no reference towards the end, because the \neffect comes from a cause other than, and outside the intention of the \nagent. But the causality of God, Who is the first agent, extends to all \nbeing, not only as to constituent principles of species, but also as to \nthe individualizing principles; not only of things incorruptible, but \nalso of things corruptible. Hence all things that exist in whatsoever \nmanner are necessarily directed by God towards some end; as the Apostle \nsays: \"Those things that are of God are well ordered [*Vulg.'Those powers \nthat are, are ordained of God': 'Quae autem sunt, a Deo ordinatae sunt.' \nSt. Thomas often quotes this passage, and invariably reads: 'Quae a Deo \nsunt, ordinata sunt.']\" (Rm. 13:1). Since, therefore, as the providence \nof God is nothing less than the type of the order of things towards an \nend, as we have said; it necessarily follows that all things, inasmuch as \nthey participate in existence, must likewise be subject to divine \nprovidence. It has also been shown (Question [14], Articles [6],11) that God knows all \nthings, both universal and particular. And since His knowledge may be \ncompared to the things themselves, as the knowledge of art to the objects \nof art, all things must of necessity come under His ordering; as all \nthings wrought by art are subject to the ordering of that art.",

For nothing escapes the order of a particular \ncause, except through the intervention and hindrance of some other \nparticular cause; as, for instance, wood may be prevented from burning, \nby the action of water. Since then, all particular causes are included \nunder the universal cause, it could not be that any effect should take \nplace outside the range of that universal cause. So far then as an effect \nescapes the order of a particular cause, it is said to be casual or \nfortuitous in respect to that cause; but if we regard the universal \ncause, outside whose range no effect can happen, it is said to be \nforeseen. Thus, for instance, the meeting of two servants, although to \nthem it appears a chance circumstance, has been fully foreseen by their \nmaster, who has purposely sent to meet at the one place, in such a way \nthat the one knows not about the other.",
        "RP2": "It is otherwise with one who has care of a particular \nthing, and one whose providence is universal, because a particular \nprovider excludes all defects from what is subject to his care as far as \nhe can; whereas, one who provides universally allows some little defect \nto remain, lest the good of the whole should be hindered. Hence, \ncorruption and defects in natural things are said to be contrary to some \nparticular nature; yet they are in keeping with the plan of universal \nnature; inasmuch as the defect in one thing yields to the good of \nanother, or even to the universal good: for the corruption of one is the \ngeneration of another, and through this it is that a species is kept in \nexistence. Since God, then, provides universally for all being, it \nbelongs to His providence to permit certain defects in particular \neffects, that the perfect good of the universe may not be hindered, for \nif all evil were prevented, much good would be absent from the universe. \nA lion would cease to live, if there were no slaying of animals; and \nthere would be no patience of martyrs if there were no tyrannical \npersecution. Thus Augustine says (Enchiridion 2): \"Almighty God would in \nno wise permit evil to exist in His works, unless He were so almighty and \nso good as to produce good even from evil.\" It would appear that it was \non account of these two arguments to which we have just replied, that \nsome were persuaded to consider corruptible things---e.g. casual and evil \nthings---as removed from the care of divine providence.",
        "RP3": "Man is not the author of nature; but he uses natural things \nin applying art and virtue to his own use. Hence human providence does \nnot reach to that which takes place in nature from necessity; but divine \nprovidence extends thus far, since God is the author of nature. \nApparently it was this argument that moved those who withdrew the course \nof nature from the care of divine providence, attributing it rather to \nthe necessity of matter, as Democritus, and others of the ancients.",
        "RP4": "When it is said that God left man to himself, this does not \nmean that man is exempt from divine providence; but merely that he has \nnot a prefixed operating force determined to only the one effect; as in \nthe case of natural things, which are  only acted upon as though directed \nby another towards an end; and do not act of themselves, as if they \ndirected themselves towards an end, like rational creatures, through the \npossession of free will, by which these are able to take counsel and make \na choice. Hence it is significantly said: \"In the hand of his own \ncounsel.\" But since the very act of free will is traced to God as to a \ncause, it necessarily follows that everything happening from the exercise \nof free will must be subject to divine providence. For human providence \nis included under the providence of God, as a particular under a \nuniversal cause. God, however, extends His providence over the just in a \ncertain more excellent way than over the wicked; inasmuch as He prevents \nanything happening which would impede their final salvation. For \"to them \nthat love God, all things work together unto good\" (Rm. 8:28). But from \nthe fact that He does not restrain the wicked from the evil of sin, He is \nsaid to abandon them: not that He altogether withdraws His providence \nfrom them; otherwise they would return to nothing, if they were not \npreserved in existence by His providence. This was the reason that had \nweight with Tully, who withdrew from the care of divine providence human \naffairs concerning which we take counsel."

        "ANS": "Since predestination includes will, as was said above \n(Article [4]), the reason of predestination must be sought for in the same way \nas was the reason of the will of God. Now it was shown above (Question [19], Article [5]), that we cannot assign any cause of the divine will on the part of the \nact of willing; but a reason can be found on the part of the things \nwilled; inasmuch as God wills one thing on account of something else. \nWherefore nobody has been so insane as to say that merit is the cause of \ndivine predestination as regards the act of the predestinator. But this \nis the question, whether, as regards the effect, predestination has any \ncause; or what comes to the same thing, whether God pre-ordained that He \nwould give the effect of predestination to anyone on account of any \nmerits.\nAccordingly there were some who held that the effect of predestination \nwas pre-ordained for some on account of pre-existing merits in a former \nlife. This was the opinion of Origen, who thought that the souls of men \nwere created in the beginning, and according to the diversity of their \nworks different states were assigned to them in this world when united \nwith the body. The  Apostle, however, rebuts this opinion where he says \n(Rm. 9:11,12): \"For when they were not yet born, nor had done any good or \nevil . . . not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said of her: The \nelder shall serve the younger.\"\nOthers said that pre-existing merits in this life are the reason and \ncause of the effect of predestination. For the Pelagians taught that the \nbeginning of doing well came from us; and the consummation from God: so \nthat it came about that the effect of predestination was granted to one, \nand not to another, because the one made a beginning by preparing, \nwhereas the other did not. But against this we have the saying of the \nApostle (2 Cor. 3:5), that \"we are not sufficient to think anything of \nourselves as of ourselves.\" Now no principle of action can be imagined \nprevious to the act of thinking. Wherefore it cannot be said that \nanything begun in us can be the reason of the effect of predestination.\nAnd so others said that merits following the effect of predestination \nare the reason of predestination; giving us to understand that God gives \ngrace to a person, and pre-ordains that He will give it, because He knows \nbeforehand that He will make good use of that grace, as if a king were to \ngive a horse to a soldier because he knows he will make good use of it. \nBut these seem to have drawn a distinction between that which flows from \ngrace, and that which flows from free will, as if the same thing cannot \ncome from both. It is, however, manifest that what is of grace is the \neffect of predestination; and this cannot be considered as the reason of \npredestination, since it is contained in the notion of predestination. \nTherefore, if anything else in us be the reason of predestination, it \nwill outside the effect of predestination. Now there is no distinction \nbetween what flows from free will, and what is of predestination; as \nthere is not distinction between what flows from a secondary cause and \nfrom a first cause. For the providence of God produces effects through \nthe operation of secondary causes, as was above shown (Question [22], Article [3]). \nWherefore, that which flows from free-will is also of predestination. We \nmust say, therefore, that the effect of predestination may be considered \nin a twofold light---in one way, in particular; and thus there is no \nreason why one effect of predestination should not be the reason or cause \nof another; a subsequent effect being the reason of a previous effect, as \nits final cause; and the previous effect being the reason of the \nsubsequent as its meritorious cause, which is reduced to the disposition \nof the matter. Thus we might say that God pre-ordained to give glory on \naccount of merit, and that He pre-ordained to give grace to merit glory. \nIn another way, the effect of predestination may be considered in \ngeneral. Thus, it is impossible that the whole of the effect of \npredestination in general should have any cause as coming from us; \nbecause whatsoever is in man disposing him towards salvation, is all \nincluded under the effect of predestination; even the preparation for \ngrace. For neither does this happen otherwise than by divine help, \naccording to the prophet Jeremias (Lam. 5:21): \"convert us, O Lord, to \nThee, and we shall be converted.\" Yet predestination has in this way, in \nregard to its effect, the goodness of God for its reason; towards  which \nthe whole effect of predestination is directed as to an end; and from \nwhich it proceeds, as from its first moving principle.",

Thus He is said to \nhave made all things through His goodness, so that the divine goodness \nmight be represented in things. Now it is necessary that God's goodness, \nwhich in itself is one and undivided, should be manifested in many ways \nin His creation; because creatures in themselves cannot attain to the \nsimplicity of God. Thus it is that for the completion of the universe \nthere are required different grades of being; some of which hold a high \nand some a low place in the universe. That this multiformity of grades \nmay be preserved in things, God allows some evils, lest many good things \nshould never happen, as was said above (Question [22], Article [2]). Let us then \nconsider the whole of the human race, as we consider the whole universe. \nGod wills to manifest His goodness in men; in respect to those whom He \npredestines, by means of His mercy, as sparing them; and in respect of \nothers, whom he reprobates, by means of His justice, in punishing them. \nThis is the reason why God elects some and rejects others. To this the \nApostle refers, saying (Rm. 9:22,23): \"What if God, willing to show His \nwrath [that is, the vengeance of His justice], and to make His power \nknown, endured [that is, permitted] with much patience vessels of wrath, \nfitted for destruction; that He might show the riches of His glory on the \nvessels of mercy, which He hath prepared unto glory\" and (2 Tim. 2:20): \n\"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver; but \nalso of wood and of earth; and some, indeed, unto honor, but some unto \ndishonor.\" Yet why He chooses some for glory, and reprobates others, has \nno reason, except the divine will. Whence Augustine says (Tract. xxvi. in \nJoan.): \"Why He draws one, and another He draws not, seek not to judge, \nif thou dost not wish to err.\" Thus too, in the things of nature, a \nreason can be assigned, since primary matter is altogether uniform, why \none part of it was fashioned by God from the beginning under the form of \nfire, another under the form of earth, that there might be a diversity of \nspecies in things of nature. Yet why this particular part of matter is \nunder this particular form, and that under another, depends upon the \nsimple will of God; as from the simple will of the artificer it depends \nthat this stone is in part of the wall, and that in another; although the \nplan requires that some stones should be in this place, and some in that \nplace. Neither on this account can there be said to be injustice in God, \nif He prepares unequal lots for not unequal things. This would be \naltogether contrary to the notion of justice, if the effect of  \npredestination were granted as a debt, and not gratuitously. In things \nwhich are given gratuitously, a person can give more or less, just as he \npleases (provided he deprives nobody of his due), without any \ninfringement of justice.

Yet the contrary follows from Mt. 7:13,14: \"For wide is the \ngate, and broad the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are \nwho go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that \nleadeth to life; and few there are who find it!\" Therefore the number of \nthose pre-ordained by God to be saved is not certain.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Corr. et Grat. 13): \"The  number of \nthe predestined is certain, and can neither be increased nor diminished.\"",
        "ANS": "The number of the predestined is certain. Some have said \nthat it was formally, but not materially certain; as if we were to say \nthat it was certain that a hundred or a thousand would be saved; not \nhowever these or those individuals. But this destroys the certainty of \npredestination; of which we spoke above (Article [6]). Therefore we must say \nthat to God the number of the predestined is certain, not only formally, \nbut also materially. It must, however, be observed that the number of the \npredestined is said to be certain to God, not by reason of His knowledge, \nbecause, that is to say, He knows how many will be saved (for in this way \nthe number of drops of rain and the sands of the sea are certain to God); \nbut by reason of His deliberate choice and determination. For the further \nevidence of which we must remember that every agent intends to make \nsomething finite, as is clear from what has been said above when we \ntreated of the infinite (Question [7], Articles [2],3). Now whosoever intends some \ndefinite measure in his effect thinks out some definite number in the \nessential parts, which are by their very nature required for the \nperfection of the whole. For of those things which are required not \nprincipally, but only on account of something else, he does not select \nany definite number \"per se\"; but he accepts and uses them in such \nnumbers as are necessary on account of that other thing. For instance, a \nbuilder thinks out the definite measurements of a house, and also the \ndefinite number of rooms which he wishes to make in the house; and \ndefinite measurements of the walls and roof; he does not, however, select \na definite number of stones, but accepts and uses just so many as are \nsufficient for the required measurements of the wall. So also must we \nconsider concerning God in regard to the whole universe, which is His \neffect. For He pre-ordained the measurements of the whole of the \nuniverse, and what number would befit the essential parts of that \nuniverse---that is to say, which have in some way been ordained in \nperpetuity; how many spheres, how many stars, how many elements, and how \nmany species. Individuals, however, which undergo corruption, are not \nordained as it were chiefly for the good of the universe, but in a \nsecondary way, inasmuch as the good of the species is preserved through \nthem. Whence, although God knows the total number of individuals, the \nnumber of oxen, flies and such like, is not pre-ordained by God \"per se\"; \nbut divine providence produces just so many as are sufficient for the \npreservation of the species. Now of all creatures the rational creature \nis chiefly ordained for the good of the universe, being as such \nincorruptible; more especially those who attain to eternal happiness, \nsince they more immediately reach the ultimate end. Whence the number of \nthe predestined is certain to God; not only by way of knowledge, but also \nby way of a principal pre-ordination.\nIt is not exactly the same thing in the case of the number of the \nreprobate, who would seem to be pre-ordained by God for the good of the \nelect, in whose regard \"all things work together unto good\" (Rm. 8:28). \nConcerning the number of all the predestined, some say that so many men \nwill be saved as angels fell; some, so  many as there were angels left; \nothers, as many as the number of angels created by God. It is, however, \nbetter to say that, \"to God alone is known the number for whom is \nreserved eternal happiness [*From the 'secret' prayer of the missal, 'pro \nvivis et defunctis.']\"",
        "RP1": "These words of Deuteronomy must be taken as applied to \nthose who are marked out by God beforehand in respect to present \nrighteousness. For their number is increased and diminished, but not the \nnumber of the predestined.",
        "RP2": "The reason of the quantity of any one part must be judged \nfrom the proportion of that part of the whole. Thus in God the reason why \nHe has made so many stars, or so many species of things, or predestined \nso many, is according to the proportion of the principal parts to the \ngood of the whole universe.",
        "RP3": "The good that is proportionate to the common state of \nnature is to be found in the majority; and is wanting in the minority. \nThe good that exceeds the common state of nature is to be found in the \nminority, and is wanting in the majority. Thus it is clear that the \nmajority of men have a sufficient knowledge for the guidance of life; and \nthose who have not this knowledge are said to be half-witted or foolish; \nbut they who attain to a profound knowledge of things intelligible are a \nvery small minority in respect to the rest. Since their eternal \nhappiness, consisting in the vision of God, exceeds the common state of \nnature, and especially in so far as this is deprived of grace through the \ncorruption of original sin, those who are saved are in the minority. In \nthis especially, however, appears the mercy of God, that He has chosen \nsome for that salvation, from which very many in accordance with the \ncommon course and tendency of nature fall short."

Therefore predestination can be furthered by the prayers \nof the saints.",
        "ANS": "Concerning this question, there were different errors. \nSome, regarding the certainty of divine predestination, said that prayers \nwere superfluous, as also anything else done to attain salvation; because \nwhether these things were done or not, the predestined would attain, and \nthe reprobate would not attain, eternal salvation. But against this \nopinion are all the warnings of Holy Scripture, exhorting us to prayer \nand other good works.\nOthers declared that the divine predestination was altered through \nprayer. This is stated to have the opinion of the Egyptians, who thought \nthat the divine ordination, which they called fate, could be frustrated \nby certain sacrifices and prayers. Against this also is the authority of \nScripture. For it is said: \"But the triumpher in Israel will not spare \nand will not be moved to repentance\" (1 Kgs. 15:29); and that \"the gifts \nand the calling of God are without repentance\" (Rm. 11:29).\nWherefore we must say otherwise that in predestination two things are to \nbe considered---namely, the divine ordination; and its effect. As regards \nthe former, in no possible way can predestination be furthered by the \nprayers of the saints. For it is not due to their prayers that anyone is \npredestined by God. As regards the latter, predestination is said to be \nhelped by the prayers of the saints, and by other good works; because \nprovidence, of which predestination is a part, does not do away with \nsecondary causes but so provides effects, that the order of secondary \ncauses falls also under providence. So, as natural effects are provided \nby God in such a way that natural causes are directed to bring about \nthose natural effects, without which those effects would not happen; so \nthe salvation of a person is predestined by God in such a way, that \nwhatever helps that person towards salvation falls under the order of \npredestination; whether it be one's own prayers or those of another; or \nother good works, and such like, without which one would not attain to \nsalvation. Whence, the predestined must strive after good works and \nprayer; because through these means predestination is most certainly \nfulfilled. For this reason it is said: \"Labor more that by good works you \nmay make sure your calling and election\" (2 Pt. 1:10).",

In this way God is helped by us; inasmuch as \nwe execute His orders, according to 1 Cor. 3:9: \"We are God's \nco-adjutors.\" Nor is this on account of any defect in the power of God, \nbut because He employs intermediary causes, in order that the beauty of \norder may be preserved in the universe; and also that He may communicate \nto creatures the dignity of causality.",

But the \npower of God is not ordered toward its effect as towards an end; rather, \nit is the end of the effect produced by it.",

It remains, therefore, according to his reckoning, that \nthe infinite power of a body, if such existed, would move without time; \nnot, however, the power of an incorporeal mover. The reason of this is \nthat one body moving another is a univocal agent; wherefore it follows \nthat the whole power of the agent is made known in its motion. Since then \nthe greater the power of a moving body, the more quickly does it move; \nthe necessary conclusion is that if its power were infinite, it would \nmove beyond comparison faster, and this is to move without time. An \nincorporeal mover, however, is not a univocal agent; whence it is not \nnecessary that the whole of its power should be manifested in motion, so \nas to move without time; and especially since it moves in accordance with \nthe disposition of its will."

        "ANS": "All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems \ndifficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for \nthere may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we \nsay that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter \naright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, \n\"God can do all things,\" is rightly understood to mean that God can do \nall things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be \nomnipotent. Now according to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, 17), a thing is \nsaid to be possible in two ways. First in relation to some power, thus \nwhatever is subject to human power is said to be possible to man. \nSecondly absolutely, on account of the relation in which the very terms \nstand to each other. Now God cannot be said to be omnipotent through \nbeing able to do all things that are possible to created nature; for the \ndivine power extends farther than that. If, however, we were to say that \nGod is omnipotent because He can do all things that are possible to His \npower, there would be a vicious circle in explaining the nature of His \npower. For this would be saying nothing else but that God is omnipotent, \nbecause He can do all that He is able to do.\nIt remains therefore, that God is called omnipotent because He can do \nall things that are possible absolutely; which is the second way of \nsaying a thing is possible. For a thing is said to be possible or \nimpossible absolutely, according to the relation in which the very terms \nstand to one another, possible if the predicate is not incompatible with \nthe subject, as that Socrates sits; and absolutely impossible when the \npredicate is altogether incompatible with the subject, as, for instance, \nthat a man is a donkey.\nIt must, however, be remembered that since every agent produces an \neffect like itself, to each active power there corresponds a thing \npossible as its proper object according to the nature of that act on \nwhich its active power is founded; for instance, the power of giving \nwarmth is related as to its proper object to the being capable of being \nwarmed. The divine existence, however, upon which the nature of power in \nGod is founded, is infinite, and is not limited to any genus of being; \nbut possesses within itself the perfection of all being. Whence, \nwhatsoever has or can have the nature of being, is numbered among the \nabsolutely possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent. \nNow nothing is opposed to the idea of being except non-being. Therefore, \nthat which implies being and non-being at the same time is repugnant to \nthe idea of an absolutely possible thing, within the scope of the divine \nomnipotence. For such cannot come under the divine omnipotence, not \nbecause of any defect in the power of God, but because it has not the \nnature of a feasible or possible thing.  Therefore, everything that does \nnot imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible \nthings, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever \nimplies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine \nomnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it \nis better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do \nthem. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: \"No word \nshall be impossible with God.\" For whatever implies a contradiction \ncannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing.",

But this must be understood either on a \ncondition, the antecedent of which is impossible---as, for instance, if \nwe were to say that God can do evil things if He will. For there is no \nreason why a conditional proposition should not be true, though both the \nantecedent and consequent are impossible: as if one were to say: \"If man \nis a donkey, he has four feet.\" Or he may be understood to mean that God \ncan do some things which now seem to be evil: which, however, if He did \nthem, would then be good.

But we showed above (Question [19], Article [3]) that God does not act \nfrom natural necessity, but that His will is the cause of all things; nor \nis that will naturally and from any necessity determined to those things. \nWhence in no way at all is the present course of events produced by God \nfrom any necessity, so that other things could not happen. Others, \nhowever, said that the divine power is restricted to this present course \nof events through the order of the divine wisdom and justice without \nwhich God does nothing. But since the power of God, which is His essence, \nis nothing else but His wisdom, it can indeed be fittingly said that \nthere is nothing in the divine power which is not in the order of the \ndivine wisdom; for the divine wisdom includes the whole potency of the \ndivine power. Yet the order placed in creation by divine wisdom, in which \norder the notion of His justice consists, as said above (Question [21], Article [2]), is \nnot so adequate to the divine wisdom that the divine wisdom should be \nrestricted to this present order of things. Now it is clear that the \nwhole idea of order which a wise man puts into things made by him is \ntaken from their end. So, when the end is proportionate to the things \nmade for that end, the wisdom of the maker is restricted to some definite \norder.

Whence, there can be \nnothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His just will or in \nHis wise intellect. Nevertheless, because His will cannot be determined \nfrom necessity to this or that order of things, except upon supposition, \nas was said above (Question [19], Article [3]), neither are the wisdom and justice of \nGod restricted to this present order, as was shown above; so nothing \nprevents there being something in the divine power which He does not \nwill, and which is not included in the order which He has place in \nthings.

        "ANS": "Divine Scripture uses, in relation to God, names which \nsignify procession. This procession has been differently understood. Some \nhave understood it in the sense of an effect, proceeding from its cause; \nso Arius took it, saying that the Son proceeds from the Father as His \nprimary creature, and that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and \nthe Son as the creature of both. In this sense neither the Son nor the \nHoly Ghost would be true God: and this is contrary to what is said of the \nSon, \"That . . . we may be in His true Son. This is true God\" (1 Jn. 5:20). Of the Holy Ghost it is also said, \"Know you not that your members \nare the temple of the Holy Ghost?\" (1 Cor. 6:19). Now, to have a temple \nis God's prerogative. Others take this procession to mean the cause \nproceeding to the effect, as moving it, or impressing its own likeness on \nit; in which sense it was understood by Sabellius, who said that God the \nFather is called Son in assuming flesh from the Virgin, and that the \nFather also is called Holy Ghost in sanctifying the rational creature, \nand moving it to life. The words of the Lord contradict such a meaning, \nwhen He speaks of Himself, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything\" (Jn. 5:19); while many other passages show the same, whereby we know that the \nFather is not the Son. Careful examination shows that both of these \nopinions take procession as meaning an outward act; hence neither of them \naffirms procession as existing in God Himself; whereas, since procession \nalways supposes action, and as there is an outward procession \ncorresponding to the act tending to external matter, so there must be an \ninward procession corresponding to the act remaining within the agent. \nThis applies most conspicuously to the intellect, the action of which \nremains in the intelligent agent. For whenever we understand, by the very \nfact of understanding there proceeds something within us, which is a \nconception of the object understood, a conception issuing from our \nintellectual power and proceeding from our knowledge of that object. This \nconception is signified by the spoken word; and it is called the word of \nthe heart signified by the word of the voice.\nAs God is above all things, we should understand what is said of God, \nnot according to the mode of the lowest creatures, namely bodies, but \nfrom the similitude of the highest creatures, the intellectual \nsubstances; while even the similitudes derived from these fall short in \nthe representation of divine objects. Procession, therefore, is not to be \nunderstood from what it is in bodies, either according to local movement \nor by way of a cause proceeding forth to its exterior effect, as, for \ninstance, like heat from the agent to the thing made hot. Rather it is to \nbe understood by way of an intelligible emanation, for example, of the  \nintelligible word which proceeds from the speaker, yet remains in him. In \nthat sense the Catholic Faith understands procession as existing in God.",

For it is clear that the more a \nthing is understood, the more closely is the intellectual conception \njoined and united to the intelligent agent; since the intellect by the \nvery act of understanding is made one with the object understood. Thus, \nas the divine intelligence is the very supreme perfection of God (Question [14], Article [2]), the divine Word is of necessity perfectly one with the source \nwhence He proceeds, without any kind of diversity.",

Not everything of that \nkind, however, is called begotten; but, strictly speaking, only what \nproceeds by way of similitude. Hence a hair has not the aspect of \ngeneration and sonship, but only that has which proceeds by way of a \nsimilitude. Nor will any likeness suffice; for a worm which is generated \nfrom animals has not the aspect of generation and sonship, although it \nhas a generic similitude; for this kind of generation requires that there \nshould be a procession by way of similitude in the same specific nature; \nas a man proceeds from a man, and a horse from a horse. So in living \nthings, which proceed from potential to actual life, such as men and \nanimals, generation includes both these kinds of generation. But if there \nis a being whose life does not proceed from potentiality to act, \nprocession (if found in such a being) excludes entirely the first kind of \ngeneration; whereas it may have that kind of generation which belongs to \nliving things.

For he said \nthat the divine relations are assistant, or externally affixed.\nTo perceive the error here expressed, we must consider that in each of \nthe nine genera of accidents there are two points for remark. One is the \nnature belonging to each one of them considered as an accident; which \ncommonly applies to each of them as inherent in a subject, for the \nessence of an accident is to inhere. The other point of remark is the \nproper nature of each one of these genera. In the genera, apart from that \nof \"relation,\" as in quantity and quality, even the true idea of the \ngenus itself is derived from a respect to the subject; for quantity is \ncalled the measure of substance, and quality is the disposition of \nsubstance. But the true idea of relation is not taken from its respect to \nthat in which it is, but from its respect to something outside. So if we \nconsider even in creatures, relations formally as such, in that aspect \nthey are said to be \"assistant,\" and not intrinsically  affixed, for, in \nthis way, they signify a respect which affects a thing related and tends \nfrom that thing to something else; whereas, if relation is considered as \nan accident, it inheres in a subject, and has an accidental existence in \nit. Gilbert de la Porree considered relation in the former mode only.\nNow whatever has an accidental existence in creatures, when considered \nas transferred to God, has a substantial existence; for there is no \naccident in God; since all in Him is His essence. So, in so far as \nrelation has an accidental existence in creatures, relation really \nexisting in God has the existence of the divine essence in no way \ndistinct therefrom. But in so far as relation implies respect to \nsomething else, no respect to the essence is signified, but rather to its \nopposite term.\nThus it is manifest that relation really existing in God is really the \nsame as His essence and only differs in its mode of intelligibility; as \nin relation is meant that regard to its opposite which is not expressed \nin the name of essence. Thus it is clear that in God relation and essence \ndo not differ from each other, but are one and the same.",

        "RP2": "As the relation which exists in creatures involves not only \na regard to another, but also something absolute, so the same applies to \nGod, yet not in the same way. What is contained in the creature above and \nbeyond what is contained in the meaning of relation, is something else \nbesides that relation; whereas in God there is no distinction, but both \nare one and the same; and this is not perfectly expressed by the word \n\"relation,\" as if it were comprehended in the ordinary meaning of that \nterm. For it was above explained (Question [13], Article [2]), in treating of the divine \nnames, that more is contained in the perfection of the divine essence \nthan can be signified by any name. Hence it does not follow that there \nexists in God anything besides relation in reality; but only in the \nvarious names imposed by us.",

But as the perfection of the divine \nessence is greater than can be  included in any name, it does not follow, \nif a relative term or any other name applied to God signify something \nimperfect, that the divine essence is in any way imperfect; for the \ndivine essence comprehends within itself the perfection of every genus \n(Question [4], Article [2])."

        "ANS": "A difficulty arises concerning the meaning of this word \n\"person\" in God, from the fact that it is predicated plurally of the \nThree in contrast to the nature of the names belonging to the essence; \nnor does it in itself refer to another, as do the words which express \nrelation.\nHence some have thought that this word \"person\" of itself expresses \nabsolutely the divine essence; as this name \"God\" and this word \"Wise\"; \nbut that to meet heretical attack, it was ordained by conciliar decree \nthat it was to be taken in a relative sense, and especially in the \nplural, or with the addition of a distinguishing adjective; as when we \nsay, \"Three persons,\" or, \"one is the person of the Father, another of \nthe Son,\" etc. Used, however, in the singular, it may be either absolute \nor relative. But this does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation; \nfor, if this word \"person,\" by force of its own signification, expresses \nthe divine essence only, it follows that forasmuch as we speak of \"three \npersons,\" so far from the heretics being silenced, they had still more \nreason to argue. Seeing this, others maintained that this word \"person\" \nin God signifies both the essence and the relation. Some of these said \nthat it signifies directly the essence, and relation indirectly, \nforasmuch as \"person\" means as it were \"by itself one\" [per se una]; and \nunity belongs to the essence. And what is \"by itself\" implies relation \nindirectly; for the Father is understood to exist \"by Himself,\" as \nrelatively distinct from the Son. Others, however, said, on the contrary, \nthat it signifies relation directly; and essence indirectly; forasmuch as \nin the definition of \"person\" the term nature is mentioned indirectly; \nand these come nearer to the truth.\nTo determine the question, we must consider that something may be \nincluded in the meaning of a less common term, which is not included in \nthe more common term; as \"rational\" is included in the meaning of \"man,\" \nand not in the meaning of \"animal.\" So that it is one thing to ask the \nmeaning of the word animal, and another to ask its meaning when the \nanimal in question is man. Also, it is one thing to ask the meaning of \nthis word \"person\" in general; and another to ask the meaning of \"person\" \nas applied to God. For \"person\" in general signifies the individual \nsubstance of a rational figure. The individual in itself is undivided, \nbut is distinct from others. Therefore \"person\" in any nature signifies \nwhat is distinct in that nature: thus in human nature it signifies this \nflesh, these bones, and this soul, which are the individuating principles \nof a man, and which, though not belonging to \"person\" in general, \nnevertheless do belong to the meaning of a particular human person.\nNow distinction in God is only by relation of origin, as stated above \n(Question [28], Articles [2],3), while relation in God is not as an accident in a \nsubject, but is the divine essence itself; and so it is subsistent, for \nthe divine essence subsists. Therefore, as the Godhead is God so the \ndivine paternity is God the Father, Who is a divine person. Therefore a \ndivine person signifies a relation as subsisting. And this is to signify \nrelation by way of substance, and such a relation is a hypostasis \nsubsisting in the divine nature, although in truth that which subsists in \nthe divine nature is the divine nature itself. Thus it is true to say \nthat the name \"person\" signifies relation directly, and the essence \nindirectly; not, however, the relation as such, but as expressed by way \nof a  hypostasis. So likewise it signifies directly the essence, and \nindirectly the relation, inasmuch as the essence is the same as the \nhypostasis: while in God the hypostasis is expressed as distinct by the \nrelation: and thus relation, as such, enters into the notion of the \nperson indirectly. Thus we can say that this signification of the word \n\"person\" was not clearly perceived before it was attacked by heretics. \nHence, this word \"person\" was used just as any other absolute term. But \nafterwards it was applied to express relation, as it lent itself to that \nsignification, so that this word \"person\" means relation not only by use \nand custom, according to the first opinion, but also by force of its own \nproper signification.",
        "RP1": "This word \"person\" is said in respect to itself, not to \nanother; forasmuch as it signifies relation not as such, but by way of a \nsubstance---which is a hypostasis. In that sense Augustine says that it \nsignifies the essence, inasmuch as in God essence is the same as the \nhypostasis, because in God what He is, and whereby He is are the same.",

Therefore two opposite relations must needs refer to two \npersons: and if any relations are not opposite they must needs belong to \nthe same person.

Others, however, assert the contrary.\nIn order to resolve this point, we may observe that all plurality is a \nconsequence of division. Now division is twofold; one is material, and is \ndivision of the continuous; from this results number, which is a species \nof quantity. Number in this sense is found only in material things which \nhave quantity. The other kind of division is called formal, and is \neffected by opposite or diverse forms; and this kind of division results \nin a multitude, which does not belong to a genus, but is transcendental \nin the sense in which being is divided by one and by many. This kind of \nmultitude is found only in immaterial things.\nSome, considering only that multitude which is a species of discrete \nquantity, and seeing that such kind of quantity has no place in God, \nasserted that the numeral terms do not denote anything real in God, but \nremove something from Him. Others, considering the same kind of \nmultitude, said that as knowledge exists in God according to the strict \nsense of the word, but not in the sense of its genus (as in God there is \nno such thing as a quality), so number exists in God in the proper sense \nof number, but not in the sense of its genus, which is quantity.\nBut we say that numeral terms predicated of God are not derived from \nnumber, a species of quantity, for in that sense they could bear only a \nmetaphorical sense in God, like other corporeal properties, such as \nlength, breadth, and the like; but that they are taken from multitude in \na transcendent sense. Now multitude so understood has relation to the \nmany of which it is predicated, as \"one\" convertible with \"being\" is \nrelated to being; which kind of oneness does not add anything to being, \nexcept a negation of division, as we saw when treating of the divine \nunity (Question [11], Article [1]); for \"one\" signifies undivided being. So, of whatever \nwe say \"one,\" we imply its undivided reality: thus, for instance, \"one\" \napplied to man signifies the undivided nature or substance of a man. In \nthe same way, when we speak of many things, multitude in this latter \nsense points to those things as being each undivided in itself.\nBut number, if taken as a species of quantity, denotes an accident added \nto being; as also does \"one\" which is the principle of that number. \nTherefore the numeral terms in God signify the things of which they are \nsaid, and beyond this they add negation only, as stated (Sent. i, D, 24); \nin which respect the Master was right (Sent. i, D, 24). So when we say, \nthe essence is one, the term \"one\" signifies the essence undivided; and \nwhen we say the person is one, it signifies the person undivided; and \nwhen we say the persons are many, we signify those persons, and their \nindividual undividedness; for it is of the very nature of multitude that \nit should be composed of units.",
        "RP1": "One, as it is a transcendental, is wider and more general \nthan substance and relation. And so likewise is multitude; hence in God \nit may mean both substance and relation, according to the context.

        "RP3": "\"One\" does not exclude multitude, but division, which \nlogically precedes one or multitude. Multitude does not remove unity, but \ndivision from each of the individuals which compose the multitude. This \nwas explained when we treated of the divine unity (Question [11], Article [2]).\nIt must be observed, nevertheless, that the opposite arguments do not \nsufficiently prove the point advanced. Although the idea of solitude is \nexcluded by plurality, and the plurality of gods by unity, it does not \nfollow that these terms express this signification alone.

Hence whenever we find terms of \"diversity\" or \"difference\" \nof Persons used in an authentic work, these terms of \"diversity\" or \n\"difference\" are taken to mean \"distinction.\" But lest the simplicity and \nsingleness of the divine essence be taken away, the terms \"separation\" \nand \"division,\" which belong to the parts of a whole, are to be avoided: \nand lest quality be taken away, we avoid the use of the term \"disparity\": \nand lest we remove similitude, we avoid the terms \"alien\" and \n\"discrepant.\" For Ambrose says (De Fide i) that \"in the Father and the \nSon there is no discrepancy, but one Godhead\": and according to Hilary, \nas quoted above, \"in God there is nothing alien, nothing separable.\"\nTo avoid the heresy of Sabellius, we must shun the term \"singularity,\" \nlest we take away the communicability of the divine essence. Hence Hilary \nsays (De Trin. vii): \"It is sacrilege to assert that the Father and the \nSon are separate in Godhead.\" We must avoid the adjective \"only\" [unici] \nlest we take away the number of persons.

Hence Ambrose says (De Fide i): \"What is one \nis not confused; and there is no multiplicity where there is no \ndifference.\" The word \"solitary\" is also to be avoided, lest we take away \nthe society of the three persons; for, as Hilary says (De Trin. iv), \"We \nconfess neither a solitary nor a diverse God.\"\nThis word \"other\" [alius], however, in the masculine sense, means only a \ndistinction of \"suppositum\"; and hence we can properly say that \"the Son \nis other than the Father,\" because He is another \"suppositum\" of the \ndivine nature, as He is another person and  another hypostasis.",

        "ANS": "It is impossible to attain to the knowledge of the \nTrinity by natural reason. For, as above explained (Question [12], Articles [4],12), man \ncannot obtain the knowledge of God by natural reason except from \ncreatures. Now creatures lead us to the knowledge of God, as effects do \nto their cause. Accordingly, by natural reason we can know of God that \nonly which of necessity belongs to Him as the principle of things, and we \nhave cited this fundamental principle in treating of God as above (Question [12], Article [12]). Now, the creative power of God is common to the whole Trinity; \nand hence it belongs to the unity of the essence, and not to the \ndistinction of the persons. Therefore, by natural reason we can know what \nbelongs to the unity of the essence, but not what belongs to the \ndistinction of the persons. Whoever, then, tries to prove the trinity of \npersons by natural reason, derogates from faith in two ways. Firstly, as \nregards the dignity of faith itself, which consists in its being \nconcerned with invisible things, that exceed human reason; wherefore the \nApostle says that \"faith is of things that appear not\" (Heb. 11:1), and \nthe same Apostle says also, \"We speak wisdom among the perfect, but not \nthe wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world; but we speak \nthe wisdom of God in a mystery which is hidden\" (1 Cor. 2:6,7). Secondly, \nas regards the utility of drawing others to the faith. For when anyone in \nthe endeavor to prove the faith brings forward reasons which are not \ncogent, he falls under the ridicule of the unbelievers: since they \nsuppose that we stand upon such reasons, and that we believe on such \ngrounds.\nTherefore, we must not attempt to prove what is of faith, except by \nauthority alone, to those who receive the authority; while as regards \nothers it suffices to prove that what faith teaches is not impossible. \nHence it is said by Dionysius (Div. Nom. ii): \"Whoever wholly resists the \nword, is far off from our philosophy; whereas if he regards the truth of \nthe word\"---i.e. \"the sacred word, we too follow this rule.\"",
        "RP1": "The philosophers did not know the mystery of the trinity of \nthe divine persons by its proper attributes, such as paternity, \nfiliation, and procession, according to the Apostle's words, \"We speak \nthe wisdom of God which none of the princes of the world\"---i.e. the \nphilosophers---\"knew\" (1 Cor. 2:6). Nevertheless, they knew some of the \nessential attributes appropriated to the persons, as power to the Father, \nwisdom to the Son, goodness to the Holy Ghost; as will later on appear. \nSo, when Aristotle said, \"By this number,\" etc., we must not take it as \nif he affirmed a threefold number in God, but that he wished to say that \nthe ancients used the threefold number in their sacrifices and prayers on \naccount of some perfection residing in the number three. In the Platonic \nbooks also we find, \"In the beginning was the word,\" not as meaning the \nPerson begotten in God, but as meaning the ideal type whereby God made \nall things, and which is appropriated to the  Son. And although they knew \nthese were appropriated to the three persons, yet they are said to have \nfailed in the third sign---that is, in the knowledge of the third person, \nbecause they deviated from the goodness appropriated to the Holy Ghost, \nin that knowing God \"they did not glorify Him as God\" (Rm. 1); or, \nbecause the Platonists asserted the existence of one Primal Being whom \nthey also declared to be the father of the universe, they consequently \nmaintained the existence of another substance beneath him, which they \ncalled \"mind\" or the \"paternal intellect,\" containing the idea of all \nthings, as Macrobius relates (Som. Scip. iv). They did not, however, \nassert the existence of a third separate substance which might correspond \nto the Holy Ghost. So also we do not assert that the Father and the Son \ndiffer in substance, which was the error of Origen and Arius, who in this \nfollowed the Platonists. When Trismegistus says, \"Monad begot monad,\" \netc., this does not refer to the generation of the Son, or to the \nprocession of the Holy Ghost, but to the production of the world.

In the first way, we can prove that God is one; and \nthe like. In the second way, reasons avail to prove the Trinity; as, when \nassumed to be true, such reasons confirm it. We must not, however, think \nthat the trinity of persons is adequately proved by such reasons. This \nbecomes evident when we consider each point; for the infinite goodness of \nGod is manifested also in creation, because to produce from nothing is an \nact of infinite power. For if God communicates Himself by His infinite \ngoodness, it is not necessary that an infinite effect should proceed from \nGod: but that according to its own mode and capacity it should receive \nthe divine goodness. Likewise, when it is said that joyous possession of \ngood requires partnership, this holds in the case of one not having \nperfect goodness: hence it needs to share some other's good, in order to \nhave the goodness of complete happiness. Nor is the image in our mind an \nadequate proof in the case of God, forasmuch as the intellect is not in \nGod and ourselves univocally. Hence, Augustine says (Tract. xxvii. in \nJoan.) that by faith we arrive at knowledge, and not conversely.",
        "RP3": "There are two reason why the knowledge of the divine \npersons was necessary for us. It was necessary for the right idea of \ncreation. The fact of saying that God made all things by His Word \nexcludes the error of those who say that God produced things by \nnecessity. When we say that in Him there is a procession  of love, we \nshow that God produced creatures not because He needed them, nor because \nof any other extrinsic reason, but on account of the love of His own \ngoodness. So Moses, when he had said, \"In the beginning God created \nheaven and earth,\" subjoined, \"God said, Let there be light,\" to manifest \nthe divine Word; and then said, \"God saw the light that it was good,\" to \nshow proof of the divine love.

        "ANS": "Prepositivus, considering the simplicity of the persons, \nsaid that in God there were no properties or notions, and wherever there \nwere mentioned, he propounded the abstract for the concrete. For as we \nare accustomed to say, \"I beseech your kindness\"---i.e. you who are \nkind---so when we speak of paternity in God, we mean God the Father.\nBut, as shown above (Question [3], Article [3], ad 1), the use of concrete and abstract \nnames in God is not in any way repugnant to the divine simplicity; \nforasmuch as we always name a thing as we understand it. Now, our \nintellect cannot attain to the absolute simplicity of the divine essence, \nconsidered in itself, and therefore, our human intellect apprehends and \nnames divine things, according to its own  mode, that is in so far as \nthey are found in sensible objects, whence its knowledge is derived. In \nthese things we use abstract terms to signify simple forms; and to \nsignify subsistent things we use concrete terms. Hence also we signify \ndivine things, as above stated, by abstract names, to express their \nsimplicity; whereas, to express their subsistence and completeness, we \nuse concrete names.\nBut not only must essential names be signified in the abstract and in \nthe concrete, as when we say Deity and God; or wisdom and wise; but the \nsame applies to the personal names, so that we may say paternity and \nFather.\nTwo chief motives for this can be cited. The first arises from the \nobstinacy of heretics. For since we confess the Father, the Son, and the \nHoly Ghost to be one God and three persons, to those who ask: \"Whereby \nare They one God? and whereby are They three persons?\" as we answer that \nThey are one in essence or deity; so there must also be some abstract \nterms whereby we may answer that the persons are distinguished; and these \nare the properties or notions signified by an abstract term, as paternity \nand filiation. Therefore the divine essence is signified as \"What\"; and \nthe person as \"Who\"; and the property as \"Whereby.\"\nThe second motive is because one person in God is related to two \npersons---namely, the person of the Father to the person of the Son and \nthe person of the Holy Ghost. This is not, however, by one relation; \notherwise it would follow that the Son also and the Holy Ghost would be \nrelated to the Father by one and the same relation. Thus, since relation \nalone multiplies the Trinity, it would follow that the Son and the Holy \nGhost would not be two persons. Nor can it be said with Prepositivus that \nas God is related in one way to creatures, while creatures are related to \nHim in divers ways, so the Father is related by one relation to the Son \nand to the Holy Ghost; whereas these two persons are related to the \nFather by two relations. For, since the very specific idea of a relation \nis that it refers to another, it must be said that two relations are not \nspecifically different if but one opposite relation corresponds to them. \nFor the relation of lord and father must differ according to the \ndifference of filiation and servitude. Now, all creatures are related to \nGod as His creatures by one specific relation. But the Son and the Holy \nGhost are not related to the Father by one and the same kind of relation. \nHence there is no parity.\nFurther, in God there is no need to admit any real relation to the \ncreature (Question [28], Article [1],3); while there is no reason against our admitting \nin God, many logical relations. But in the Father there must be a real \nrelation to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. Hence, corresponding to the \ntwo relations of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, whereby they are related \nto the Father, we must understand two relations in the Father, whereby He \nis related to the Son and to the Holy Ghost. Hence, since there is only \none Person of the Father, it is necessary that the relations should be \nseparately signified in the abstract; and these are what we mean by \nproperties and notions.",

Therefore the Person of the Father cannot be known by the fact \nthat He is from another; but by the fact that He is from no one; and thus \nthe notion that belongs to Him is called \"innascibility.\" As the source \nof another, He can be known in two ways, because as the Son is from Him, \nthe Father is known by the notion of \"paternity\"; and as the Holy Ghost \nis from Him, He is known by the notion of \"common spiration.\" The Son can \nbe known as begotten by another, and thus He is known by \"filiation\"; and \nalso by another person proceeding from Him, the Holy Ghost, and thus He \nis known in the same way as the Father is known, by \"common spiration.\" \nThe Holy Ghost can be known by the fact that He is from another, or from \nothers; thus He is known by \"procession\"; but not by the fact that \nanother is from Him, as no divine person proceeds from Him.\nTherefore, there are Five notions in God: \"innascibility,\" \"paternity,\" \n\"filiation,\" and \"procession.\" Of these only four are relations, for \n\"innascibility\" is not a relation, except by reduction, as will appear \nlater (Question [33], Article [4], ad 3).

        "OB2": "Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. ix, 10), \"The Word is \nknowledge with love;\" and according to Anselm (Monol. lx), \"To speak is \nto the Supreme Spirit nothing but to see by thought.\" But knowledge and \nthought, and sight, are essential terms in God.

Therefore, the name Word is used as an essential term in God, and \nnot in a personal sense.",
        "OB4": "Further, no divine person is made. But the Word of God is \nsomething made. For it is said, \"Fire, hail, snow, ice, the storms which \ndo His Word\" (Ps. 148:8). Therefore the Word is not a  personal name in \nGod.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 11): \"As the Son is \nrelated to the Father, so also is the Word to Him Whose Word He is.\" But \nthe Son is a personal name, since it is said relatively. Therefore so \nalso is Word.",
        "ANS": "The name of Word in God, if taken in its proper sense, is \na personal name, and in no way an essential name.\nTo see how this is true, we must know that our own word taken in its \nproper sense has a threefold meaning; while in a fourth sense it is taken \nimproperly or figuratively. The clearest and most common sense is when it \nis said of the word spoken by the voice; and this proceeds from an \ninterior source as regards two things found in the exterior word---that \nis, the vocal sound itself, and the signification of the sound. For, \naccording to the Philosopher (Peri Herm. i) vocal sound signifies the \nconcept of the intellect. Again the vocal sound proceeds from the \nsignification or the imagination, as stated in De Anima ii, text 90. The \nvocal sound, which has no signification cannot be called a word: \nwherefore the exterior vocal sound is called a word from the fact the it \nsignifies the interior concept of the mind. Therefore it follows that, \nfirst and chiefly, the interior concept of the mind is called a word; \nsecondarily, the vocal sound itself, signifying the interior concept, is \nso called; and thirdly, the imagination of the vocal sound is called a \nword. Damascene mentions these three kinds of words (De Fide Orth. i, \n17), saying that \"word\" is called \"the natural movement of the intellect, \nwhereby it is moved, and understands, and thinks, as light and splendor;\" \nwhich is the first kind. \"Again,\" he says, \"the word is what is not \npronounced by a vocal word, but is uttered in the heart;\" which is the \nthird kind. \"Again,\" also, \"the word is the angel\"---that is, the \nmessenger \"of intelligence;\" which is the second kind. Word is also used \nin a fourth way figuratively for that which is signified or effected by a \nword; thus we are wont to say, \"this is the word I have said,\" or \"which \nthe king has commanded,\" alluding to some deed signified by the word \neither by way of assertion or of command.\nNow word is taken strictly in God, as signifying the concept of the \nintellect. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 10): \"Whoever can \nunderstand the word, not only before it is sounded, but also before \nthought has clothed it with imaginary sound, can already see some \nlikeness of that Word of Whom it is said: In the beginning was the Word.\" \nThe concept itself of the heart has of its own nature to proceed from \nsomething other than itself---namely, from the knowledge of the one \nconceiving. Hence \"Word,\" according as we use the term strictly of God, \nsignifies something proceeding from another; which belongs to the nature \nof personal terms in God, inasmuch as the divine persons are \ndistinguished by origin (Question [27], Articles [3],4,5). Hence the term \"Word,\" \naccording as we use the term strictly of God, is to be taken as said not \nessentially, but personally.",
        "RP1": "The Arians, who sprang from Origen, declared that the Son \ndiffered in substance from the Father. Hence, they endeavored to maintain \nthat when the Son of God is called the Word, this is not to be understood \nin a strict sense; lest the idea of the Word proceeding should compel \nthem to confess that the Son of God is of the same substance as the \nFather. For the interior word proceeds in such a manner from the one who \npronounces it, as to remain within him. But supposing Word to be said \nmetaphorically of God, we must still admit Word in its strict sense. For \nif a thing be called a word metaphorically, this can only be by reason of \nsome manifestation; either it makes something manifest as a word, or it \nis manifested by a word. If manifested by a word, there must exist a word \nwhereby it is manifested. If it is called a word because it exteriorly \nmanifests, what it exteriorly manifests cannot be called word except in \nas far as it signifies the interior concept of the mind, which anyone may \nalso manifest by exterior signs. Therefore, although Word may be \nsometimes said of God metaphorically, nevertheless we must also admit \nWord in the proper sense, and which is said personally.",
        "RP2": "Nothing belonging to the intellect can be applied to God \npersonally, except word alone; for word alone signifies that which \nemanates from another. For what the intellect forms in its conception is \nthe word. Now, the intellect itself, according as it is made actual by \nthe intelligible species, is considered absolutely; likewise the act of \nunderstanding which is to the actual intellect what existence is to \nactual being; since the act of understanding does not signify an act \ngoing out from the intelligent agent, but an act remaining in the agent. \nTherefore when we say that word is knowledge, the term knowledge does not \nmean the act of a knowing intellect, or any one of its habits, but stands \nfor what the intellect conceives by knowing. Hence also Augustine says \n(De Trin. vii, 1) that the Word is \"begotten wisdom;\" for it is nothing \nbut the concept of the Wise One; and in the same way It can be called \n\"begotten knowledge.\" Thus can also be explained how \"to speak\" is in God \n\"to see by thought,\" forasmuch as the Word is conceived by the gaze of \nthe divine thought. Still the term \"thought\" does not properly apply to \nthe Word of God. For Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 16): \"Therefore do we \nspeak of the Word of God, and not of the Thought of God, lest we believe \nthat in God there is something unstable, now assuming the form of Word, \nnow putting off that form and remaining latent and as it were formless.\" \nFor thought consists properly in the search after the truth, and this has \nno place in God. But when the intellect attains to the form of truth, it \ndoes not think, but perfectly contemplates the truth. Hence Anselm \n(Monol. lx) takes \"thought\" in an improper sense for \"contemplation.\"",
        "RP3": "As, properly speaking, Word in God is said personally, and \nnot essentially, so likewise is to \"speak.\" Hence, as the Word is not \ncommon to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, so it is not true that the \nFather, Son, and Holy Ghost are one speaker. So Augustine says (De Trin. \nvii, 1): \"He who speaks in that co-eternal Word is understood as not \nalone in God, but as being  with that very Word, without which, forsooth, \nHe would not be speaking.\" On the other hand, \"to be spoken\" belongs to \neach Person, for not only is the word spoken, but also the thing \nunderstood or signified by the word. Therefore in this manner to one \nperson alone in God does it belong to be spoken in the same way as a word \nis spoken; whereas in the way whereby a thing is spoken as being \nunderstood in the word, it belongs to each Person to be spoken. For the \nFather, by understanding Himself, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and all \nother things comprised in this knowledge, conceives the Word; so that \nthus the whole Trinity is \"spoken\" in the Word; and likewise also all \ncreatures: as the intellect of a man by the word he conceives in the act \nof understanding a stone, speaks a stone. Anselm took the term \"speak\" \nimproperly for the act of understanding; whereas they really differ from \neach other; for \"to understand\" means only the habitude of the \nintelligent agent to the thing understood, in which habitude no trace of \norigin is conveyed, but only a certain information of our intellect; \nforasmuch as our intellect is made actual by the form of the thing \nunderstood. In God, however, it means complete identity, because in God \nthe intellect and the thing understood are altogether the same, as was \nproved above (Question [14], Articles [4],5). Whereas to \"speak\" means chiefly the \nhabitude to the word conceived; for \"to speak\" is nothing but to utter a \nword. But by means of the word it imports a habitude to the thing \nunderstood which in the word uttered is manifested to the one who \nunderstands. Thus, only the Person who utters the Word is \"speaker\" in \nGod, although each Person understands and is understood, and consequently \nis spoken by the Word.",
        "RP4": "The term \"word\" is there taken figuratively, as the thing \nsignified or effected by word is called word. For thus creatures are said \nto do the word of God, as executing any effect, whereto they are ordained \nfrom the word conceived of the divine wisdom; as anyone is said to do the \nword of the king when he does the work to which he is appointed by the \nking's word."

The \nappropriateness of this name may be shown in two ways. Firstly, from the \nfact that the person who is called \"Holy Ghost\" has something in common \nwith the other Persons. For, as Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 17; v, 11), \n\"Because the Holy Ghost is common to both, He Himself is called that \nproperly which both are called in common.

For the name \nspirit in things corporeal seems to signify impulse and motion; for we \ncall the breath and the wind by the term spirit. Now it is a property of \nlove to move and impel the will of the lover towards the object loved. \nFurther, holiness is attributed to whatever is ordered to God.

But it is \npossible for the Holy Ghost to be distinguished from the Son, even if He \ndid not proceed from Him. For Anselm says (De Process. Spir. Sancti, ii): \n\"The Son and the Holy Ghost have their Being from the Father; but each in \na different way; one by Birth, the other by Procession, so that they are \nthus distinct from one another.\" And further on he says: \"For even if for \nno other reason were the Son and the Holy Ghost distinct, this alone \nwould suffice.\" Therefore the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Son, \nwithout proceeding from Him.\nReply to  The Word in God is not taken after the similitude of the \nvocal word, whence the breath [spiritus] does not proceed; for it would \nthen be only metaphorical; but after the similitude of the mental word, \nwhence proceeds love.\nReply to Objection 6: For the reason that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father \nperfectly, not only is it not superfluous to say He proceeds from the \nSon, but rather it is absolutely necessary. Forasmuch as one power \nbelongs to the Father and the Son; and because whatever is from the \nFather, must be from the Son unless it be opposed to the property of \nfiliation; for the Son is not from Himself, although He is from the \nFather.\nReply to Objection 7: The Holy Ghost is distinguished from the Son, inasmuch as \nthe origin of one is distinguished from the origin of the other; but the \ndifference itself of origin comes from the fact that the Son is only from \nthe Father, whereas the Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son; for \notherwise the processions would not be distinguished from each other, as \nexplained above, and in Question [27].",

For \nif He were not from Him, He could in no wise be personally distinguished \nfrom Him; as appears from what has been said above (Question [28], Article [3]; Question [30], Article [2]). For it cannot be said that the divine Persons are distinguished \nfrom each other in any absolute sense; for it would follow that there \nwould not be one essence of the three persons: since everything that is \nspoken of God in an absolute sense, belongs to the unity of essence. \nTherefore it must be said that the divine persons are distinguished from \neach other only by the relations. Now the relations cannot distinguish \nthe persons except forasmuch as they are opposite relations; which \nappears from the fact that the Father has two relations, by one of which \nHe is related to the Son, and by the other to the Holy Ghost; but these \nare not opposite relations, and therefore they do not make two persons, \nbut belong only to the one person of the Father. If therefore in the Son \nand the Holy Ghost there were two relations  only, whereby each of them \nwere related to the Father, these relations would not be opposite to each \nother, as neither would be the two relations whereby the Father is \nrelated to them. Hence, as the person of the Father is one, it would \nfollow that the person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost would be one, \nhaving two relations opposed to the two relations of the Father. But this \nis heretical since it destroys the Faith in the Trinity. Therefore the \nSon and the Holy Ghost must be related to each other by opposite \nrelations. Now there cannot be in God any relations opposed to each \nother, except relations of origin, as proved above (Question [28], Article [44]). And \nopposite relations of origin are to be understood as of a \"principle,\" \nand of what is \"from the principle.\" Therefore we must conclude that it \nis necessary to say that either the Son is from the Holy Ghost; which no \none says; or that the Holy Ghost is from the Son, as we confess.\nFurthermore, the order of the procession of each one agrees with this \nconclusion. For it was said above (Question [27], Articles [2],4; Question [28], Article [4]), that the \nSon proceeds by the way of the intellect as Word, and the Holy Ghost by \nway of the will as Love. Now love must proceed from a word. For we do not \nlove anything unless we apprehend it by a mental conception. Hence also \nin this way it is manifest that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son.\nWe derive a knowledge of the same truth from the very order of nature \nitself. For we nowhere find that several things proceed from one without \norder except in those which differ only by their matter; as for instance \none smith produces many knives distinct from each other materially, with \nno order to each other; whereas in things in which there is not only a \nmaterial distinction we always find that some order exists in the \nmultitude produced. Hence also in the order of creatures produced, the \nbeauty of the divine wisdom is displayed. So if from the one Person of \nthe Father, two persons proceed, the Son and the Holy Ghost, there must \nbe some order between them. Nor can any other be assigned except the \norder of their nature, whereby one is from the other. Therefore it cannot \nbe said that the Son and the Holy Ghost proceed from the Father in such a \nway as that neither of them proceeds from the other, unless we admit in \nthem a material distinction; which is impossible.\nHence also the Greeks themselves recognize that the procession of the \nHoly Ghost has some order to the Son. For they grant that the Holy Ghost \nis the Spirit \"of the Son\"; and that He is from the Father \"through the \nSon.\" Some of them are said also to concede that \"He is from the Son\"; or \nthat \"He flows from the Son,\" but not that He proceeds; which seems to \ncome from ignorance or obstinacy. For a just consideration of the truth \nwill convince anyone that the word procession is the one most commonly \napplied to all that denotes origin of any kind. For we use the term to \ndescribe any kind of origin; as when we say that a line proceeds from a \npoint, a ray from the sun, a stream from a source, and likewise in \neverything else. Hence, granted that the Holy Ghost originates in any way \nfrom the Son, we can conclude that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son.",

It is also a rule of Holy \nScripture that whatever is said of the Father, applies to the Son, \nalthough there be added an exclusive term; except only as regards what \nbelongs to the opposite relations, whereby the Father and the Son are \ndistinguished from each other. For when the Lord says, \"No one knoweth \nthe Son, but the Father,\" the idea of the Son knowing Himself is not \nexcluded. So therefore when we say that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the \nFather, even though it be added that He proceeds from the Father alone, \nthe Son would not thereby be at all excluded; because as regards being \nthe principle of the Holy Ghost, the Father and the Son are not opposed \nto each other, but only as regards the fact that one is the Father, and \nthe other is the Son.",

If taken personally it is the proper name of the Holy Ghost; \nas Word is the proper name of the Son.\nTo see this we must know that since as shown above (Question [27], Articles [2],3,4,5), \nthere are two processions in God, one by way of the intellect, which is \nthe procession of the Word, and another by way of the will, which is the \nprocession of Love; forasmuch as the former is the more known to us, we \nhave been able to apply more suitable names to express our various \nconsiderations as regards that procession, but not as regards the \nprocession of the will. Hence, we are obliged to employ circumlocution as \nregards the person Who proceeds, and the relations following from this \nprocession which are called \"procession\" and \"spiration,\" as stated  \nabove (Question [27], Article [4], ad 3), and yet express the origin rather than the \nrelation in the strict sense of the term. Nevertheless we must consider \nthem in respect of each procession simply. For as when a thing is \nunderstood by anyone, there results in the one who understands a \nconception of the object understood, which conception we call word; so \nwhen anyone loves an object, a certain impression results, so to speak, \nof the thing loved in the affection of the lover; by reason of which the \nobject loved is said to be in the lover; as also the thing understood is \nin the one who understands; so that when anyone understands and loves \nhimself he is in himself, not only by real identity, but also as the \nobject understood is in the one who understands, and the thing loved is \nin the lover. As regards the intellect, however, words have been found to \ndescribe the mutual relation of the one who understands the object \nunderstood, as appears in the word \"to understand\"; and other words are \nused to express the procession of the intellectual conception---namely, \n\"to speak,\" and \"word.\" Hence in God, \"to understand\" is applied only to \nthe essence; because it does not import relation to the Word that \nproceeds; whereas \"Word\" is said personally, because it signifies what \nproceeds; and the term \"to speak\" is a notional term as importing the \nrelation of the principle of the Word to the Word Himself. On the other \nhand, on the part of the will, with the exception of the words \n\"dilection\" and \"love,\" which express the relation of the lover to the \nobject loved, there are no other terms in use, which express the relation \nof the impression or affection of the object loved, produced in the lover \nby fact that he loves---to the principle of that impression, or \"vice \nversa.\" And therefore, on account of the poverty of our vocabulary, we \nexpress these relations by the words \"love\" and \"dilection\": just as if \nwe were to call the Word \"intelligence conceived,\" or \"wisdom begotten.\"\nIt follows that so far as love means only the relation of the lover to \nthe object loved, \"love\" and \"to love\" are said of the essence, as \n\"understanding\" and \"to understand\"; but, on the other hand, so far as \nthese words are used to express the relation to its principle, of what \nproceeds by way of love, and \"vice versa,\" so that by \"love\" is \nunderstood the \"love proceeding,\" and by \"to love\" is understood \"the \nspiration of the love proceeding,\" in that sense \"love\" is the name of \nthe person and \"to love\" is a notional term, as \"to speak\" and \"to beget.\"",

But in God, in whom \nthere is nothing  accidental, there is more than this; because both Word \nand Love are subsistent. Therefore, when we say that the Holy Ghost is \nthe Love of the Father for the Son, or for something else; we do not mean \nanything that passes into another, but only the relation of love to the \nbeloved; as also in the Word is imported the relation of the Word to the \nthing expressed by the Word.",

        "ANS": "A difficulty about this question is objected to the \neffect that when we say, \"the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost,\" \nsince the ablative is construed as denoting a cause, it seems to mean \nthat the Holy Ghost is the principle of love to the Father and the Son; \nwhich cannot be admitted.\nIn view of this difficulty some have held that it is false, that \"the \nFather and the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost\"; and they add that \nit was retracted by Augustine when he retracted its equivalent to the \neffect that \"the Father is wise by the Wisdom begotten.\" Others say that \nthe proposition is inaccurate and ought to be expounded, as that \"the \nFather loves the Son by the Holy Ghost\"---that is, \"by His essential \nLove,\" which is appropriated to the Holy Ghost. Others further say that \nthis ablative should be construed as importing a sign, so that it means, \n\"the Holy Ghost is the sign that the Father loves the Son\"; inasmuch as \nthe Holy Ghost proceeds from them both, as Love. Others, again, say that \nthis ablative must be construed as importing the relation of formal \ncause, because the Holy Ghost is the love whereby the Father and the Son \nformally love each other. Others, again, say that it should be construed \nas importing the relation of a formal effect; and these approach nearer \nto the truth.\nTo make the matter clear, we must consider that since a thing is \ncommonly denominated from its forms, as \"white\" from whiteness, and \"man\" \nfrom humanity; everything whence anything is denominated, in this \nparticular respect stands to that thing in the relation of form. So when \nI say, \"this man is clothed with a garment,\" the ablative is to be \nconstrued as having relation to the formal cause, although the garment is \nnot the form. Now it may happen that a thing may be denominated from that \nwhich proceeds from it, not only as an agent is from its action, but also \nas from the term itself of the action---that is, the effect, when the \neffect itself is included in the idea of the action. For we say that fire \nwarms by heating, although heating is not the heat which is the form of \nthe fire, but is an action proceeding from the fire; and we say that a \ntree flowers with the flower, although the flower is not the tree's form, \nbut is the effect proceeding from the form. In this way, therefore, we \nmust say that since in God \"to love\" is taken in two ways, essentially \nand notionally, when it is taken essentially, it means that the Father \nand the Son love each other not by the Holy Ghost, but by their essence. \nHence Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 7): \"Who dares to say that the Father \nloves neither Himself, nor the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, except by the \nHoly Ghost?\" The opinions first quoted are to be taken in this sense. But \nwhen the term Love  is taken in a notional sense it means nothing else \nthan \"to spirate love\"; just as to speak is to produce a word, and to \nflower is to produce flowers. As therefore we say that a tree flowers by \nits flower, so do we say that the Father, by the Word or the Son, speaks \nHimself, and His creatures; and that the Father and the Son love each \nother and us, by the Holy Ghost, or by Love proceeding.",
        "RP1": "To be wise or intelligent is taken only essentially in God; \ntherefore we cannot say that \"the Father is wise or intelligent by the \nSon.\" But to love is taken not only essentially, but also in a notional \nsense; and in this way, we can say that the Father and the Son love each \nother by the Holy Ghost, as was above explained.",
        "RP2": "When the idea of an action includes a determined effect, \nthe principle of the action may be denominated both from the action, and \nfrom the effect; so we can say, for instance, that a tree flowers by its \nflowering and by its flower. When, however, the idea of an action does \nnot include a determined effect, then in that case, the principle of the \naction cannot be denominated from the effect, but only from the action. \nFor we do not say that the tree produces the flower by the flower, but by \nthe production of the flower. So when we say, \"spirates\" or \"begets,\" \nthis imports only a notional act. Hence we cannot say that the Father \nspirates by the Holy Ghost, or begets by the Son. But we can say that the \nFather speaks by the Word, as by the Person proceeding, \"and speaks by \nthe speaking,\" as by a notional act; forasmuch as \"to speak\" imports a \ndeterminate person proceeding; since \"to speak\" means to produce a word. \nLikewise to love, taken in a notional sense, means to produce love; and \nso it can be said that the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost, as by \nthe person proceeding, and by Love itself as a notional act.",
        "RP3": "The Father loves not only the Son, but also Himself and us, \nby the Holy Ghost; because, as above explained, to love, taken in a \nnotional sense, not only imports the production of a divine person, but \nalso the person produced, by way of love, which has relation to the \nobject loved. Hence, as the Father speaks Himself and every creature by \nHis begotten Word, inasmuch as the Word \"begotten\" adequately represents \nthe Father and every creature; so He loves Himself and every creature by \nthe Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love of the \nprimal goodness whereby the Father loves Himself and every creature. Thus \nit is evident that relation to the creature is implied both in the Word \nand in the proceeding Love, as it were in a secondary way, inasmuch as \nthe divine truth and goodness are a principle of understanding and loving \nall creatures."

Christ. i, 5): \"Unity is in \nthe Father, equality in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost is the concord of \nequality and unity.\" This does not, however, seem fitting; because one \nperson does not receive formal denomination from what is appropriated to \nanother. For the Father is not wise by the wisdom begotten, as above \nexplained (Question [37], Article [2], ad 1). But, as he subjoins, \"All these three are \none by the Father; all are equal by the Son, and all united by the Holy \nGhost.\" The above, therefore, are not fittingly appropriated to the \nPersons.",
        "OB3": "Further, according to Augustine, to the Father is attributed \n\"power,\" to the Son \"wisdom,\" to the Holy Ghost \"goodness.\" Nor does this \nseem fitting; for \"strength\" is part of power, whereas strength is found \nto be appropriated to the Son, according to the text, \"Christ the \nstrength [*Douay: power] of God\" (1 Cor. 1:24). So it is likewise \nappropriated to the Holy Ghost, according to the words, \"strength \n[*Douay: virtue] came out from Him and healed all\" (Lk. 6:19). Therefore \npower should not be appropriated to the Father.",
        "OB4": "Likewise Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 10): \"What the Apostle \nsays, \"From Him, and by Him, and in Him,\" is not to be taken in a \nconfused sense.\" And (Contra Maxim. ii) \"'from Him' refers to the Father, \n'by Him' to the Son, 'in Him' to the Holy Ghost.'\" This, however, seems \nto be incorrectly said; for the words \"in Him\" seem to imply the relation \nof final cause, which is first among the causes. Therefore this relation \nof cause should be appropriated to the Father, Who is \"the principle from \nno principle.\"",
        "OB5": "Likewise, Truth is appropriated to the Son, according to Jn. \n14:6, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life\"; and likewise \"the book of \nlife,\" according to Ps. 39:9, \"In the beginning of the book it is written \nof Me,\" where a gloss observes, \"that is, with the Father Who is My \nhead,\" also this word \"Who is\"; because on the text of Is. 65:1, \"Behold \nI go to the Gentiles,\" a gloss adds, \"The Son speaks Who said to Moses, I \nam Who am.\" These appear to belong to the Son, and are not appropriated. \nFor \"truth,\" according to Augustine (De Vera Relig. 36), \"is the supreme \nsimilitude of the principle without any dissimilitude.\" So it seems that \nit properly belongs to the Son, Who has a principle. Also the \"book of \nlife\" seems proper to the Son, as signifying \"a thing from another\"; for \nevery book is written by someone. This also, \"Who is,\" appears to be \nproper to the Son; because if when it was said to Moses, \"I am Who am,\" \nthe Trinity spoke, then Moses could have said, \"He Who is Father, Son, \nand Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost sent me to you,\" so also he could have \nsaid further, \"He Who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost sent \nme to you,\" pointing out a certain person. This, however, is false; \nbecause no person is Father, Son  and Holy Ghost. Therefore it cannot be \ncommon to the Trinity, but is proper to the Son.",
        "ANS": "Our intellect, which is led to the knowledge of God from \ncreatures, must consider God according to the mode derived from \ncreatures. In considering any creature four points present themselves to \nus in due order. Firstly, the thing itself taken absolutely is considered \nas a being. Secondly, it is considered as one. Thirdly, its intrinsic \npower of operation and causality is considered. The fourth point of \nconsideration embraces its relation to its effects. Hence this fourfold \nconsideration comes to our mind in reference to God.\nAccording to the first point of consideration, whereby we consider God \nabsolutely in His being, the appropriation mentioned by Hilary applies, \naccording to which \"eternity\" is appropriated to the Father, \"species\" to \nthe Son, \"use\" to the Holy Ghost. For \"eternity\" as meaning a \"being\" \nwithout a principle, has a likeness to the property of the Father, Who is \n\"a principle without a principle.\" Species or beauty has a likeness to \nthe property of the Son. For beauty includes three conditions, \n\"integrity\" or \"perfection,\" since those things which are impaired are by \nthe very fact ugly; due \"proportion\" or \"harmony\"; and lastly, \n\"brightness\" or \"clarity,\" whence things are called beautiful which have \na bright color.\nThe first of these has a likeness to the property of the Son, inasmuch \nas He as Son has in Himself truly and perfectly the nature of the Father. \nTo insinuate this, Augustine says in his explanation (De Trin. vi, 10): \n\"Where---that is, in the Son---there is supreme and primal life,\" etc.\nThe second agrees with the Son's property, inasmuch as He is the express \nImage of the Father. Hence we see that an image is said to be beautiful, \nif it perfectly represents even an ugly thing. This is indicated by \nAugustine when he says (De Trin. vi, 10), \"Where there exists wondrous \nproportion and primal equality,\" etc.\nThe third agrees with the property of the Son, as the Word, which is the \nlight and splendor of the intellect, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. \niii, 3). Augustine alludes to the same when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): \n\"As the perfect Word, not wanting in anything, and, so to speak, the art \nof the omnipotent God,\" etc.\n\"Use\" has a likeness to the property of the Holy Ghost; provided the \n\"use\" be taken in a wide sense, as including also the sense of \"to \nenjoy\"; according as \"to use\" is to employ something at the beck of the \nwill, and \"to enjoy\" means to use joyfully, as Augustine says (De Trin. \nx, 11). So \"use,\" whereby the Father and the Son enjoy each other, agrees \nwith the property of the Holy Ghost, as Love. This is what Augustine says \n(De Trin. vi, 10): \"That love, that delectation, that felicity or \nbeatitude, is called use by him\" (Hilary). But the \"use\" by which we \nenjoy God, is likened to the property of the Holy Ghost as the Gift; and  \nAugustine points to this when he says (De Trin. vi, 10): \"In the Trinity, \nthe Holy Ghost, the sweetness of the Begettor and the Begotten, pours out \nupon us mere creatures His immense bounty and wealth.\" Thus it is clear \nhow \"eternity,\" \"species,\" and \"use\" are attributed or appropriated to \nthe persons, but not essence or operation; because, being common, there \nis nothing in their concept to liken them to the properties of the \nPersons.\nThe second consideration of God regards Him as \"one.\" In that view \nAugustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) appropriates \"unity\" to the Father, \n\"equality\" to the Son, \"concord\" or \"union\" to the Holy Ghost. It is \nmanifest that these three imply unity, but in different ways. For \"unity\" \nis said absolutely, as it does not presuppose anything else; and for this \nreason it is appropriated to the Father, to Whom any other person is not \npresupposed since He is the \"principle without principle.\" \"Equality\" \nimplies unity as regards another; for that is equal which has the same \nquantity as another. So equality is appropriated to the Son, Who is the \n\"principle from a principle.\" \"Union\" implies the unity of two; and is \ntherefore appropriated to the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He proceeds from \ntwo. And from this we can understand what Augustine means when he says \n(De Doctr. Christ. i, 5) that \"The Three are one, by reason of the \nFather; They are equal by reason of the Son; and are united by reason of \nthe Holy Ghost.\" For it is clear that we trace a thing back to that in \nwhich we find it first: just as in this lower world we attribute life to \nthe vegetative soul, because therein we find the first trace of life. Now \n\"unity\" is perceived at once in the person of the Father, even if by an \nimpossible hypothesis, the other persons were removed. So the other \npersons derive their unity from the Father. But if the other persons be \nremoved, we do not find equality in the Father, but we find it as soon as \nwe suppose the Son. So, all are equal by reason of the Son, not as if the \nSon were the principle of equality in the Father, but that, without the \nSon equal to the Father, the Father could not be called equal; because \nHis equality is considered firstly in regard to the Son: for that the \nHoly Ghost is equal to the Father, is also from the Son. Likewise, if the \nHoly Ghost, Who is the union of the two, be excluded, we cannot \nunderstand the oneness of the union between the Father and the Son. So \nall are connected by reason of the Holy Ghost; because given the Holy \nGhost, we find whence the Father and the Son are said to be united.\nAccording to the third consideration, which brings before us the \nadequate power of God in the sphere of causality, there is said to be a \nthird kind of appropriation, of \"power,\" \"wisdom,\" and \"goodness.\" This \nkind of appropriation is made both by reason of similitude as regards \nwhat exists in the divine persons, and by reason of dissimilitude if we \nconsider what is in creatures. For \"power\" has the nature of a principle, \nand so it has a likeness to the heavenly Father, Who is the principle of \nthe whole Godhead. But in an earthly father it is wanting sometimes by \nreason of old age. \"Wisdom\" has likeness to the heavenly Son, as the \nWord, for a word is nothing but the concept of wisdom. In an earthly son \nthis is sometimes absent by reason of lack of years. \"Goodness,\" as the  \nnature and object of love, has likeness to the Holy Ghost; but seems \nrepugnant to the earthly spirit, which often implies a certain violent \nimpulse, according to Is. 25:4: \"The spirit of the strong is as a blast \nbeating on the wall.\" \"Strength\" is appropriated to the Son and to the \nHoly Ghost, not as denoting the power itself of a thing, but as sometimes \nused to express that which proceeds from power; for instance, we say that \nthe strong work done by an agent is its strength.\nAccording to the fourth consideration, i.e. God's relation to His \neffects, there arise appropriation of the expression \"from Whom, by Whom, \nand in Whom.\" For this preposition \"from\" [ex] sometimes implies a \ncertain relation of the material cause; which has no place in God; and \nsometimes it expresses the relation of the efficient cause, which can be \napplied to God by reason of His active power; hence it is appropriated to \nthe Father in the same way as power. The preposition \"by\" [per] sometimes \ndesignates an intermediate cause; thus we may say that a smith works \"by\" \na hammer. Hence the word \"by\" is not always appropriated to the Son, but \nbelongs to the Son properly and strictly, according to the text, \"All \nthings were made by Him\" (Jn. 1:3); not that the Son is an instrument, \nbut as \"the principle from a principle.\" Sometimes it designates the \nhabitude of a form \"by\" which an agent works; thus we say that an \nartificer works by his art. Hence, as wisdom and art are appropriated to \nthe Son, so also is the expression \"by Whom.\" The preposition \"in\" \nstrictly denotes the habitude of one containing. Now, God contains things \nin two ways: in one way by their similitudes; thus things are said to be \nin God, as existing in His knowledge. In this sense the expression \"in \nHim\" should be appropriated to the Son. In another sense things are \ncontained in God forasmuch as He in His goodness preserves and governs \nthem, by guiding them to a fitting end; and in this sense the expression \n\"in Him\" is appropriated to the Holy Ghost, as likewise is \"goodness.\" \nNor need the habitude of the final cause (though the first of causes) be \nappropriated to the Father, Who is \"the principle without a principle\": \nbecause the divine persons, of Whom the Father is the principle, do not \nproceed from Him as towards an end, since each of Them is the last end; \nbut They proceed by a natural procession, which seems more to belong to \nthe nature of a natural power.\nRegarding the other points of inquiry, we can say that since \"truth\" \nbelongs to the intellect, as stated above (Question [16], Article [1]), it is \nappropriated to the Son, without, however, being a property of His. For \ntruth can be considered as existing in the thought or in the thing \nitself. Hence, as intellect and thing in their essential meaning, are \nreferred to the essence, and not to the persons, so the same is to be \nsaid of truth. The definition quoted from Augustine belongs to truth as \nappropriated to the Son. The \"book of life\" directly means knowledge but \nindirectly it means life. For, as above explained (Question [24], Article [1]), it is \nGod's knowledge regarding those who are to possess eternal life. \nConsequently, it is appropriated to the Son; although life is \nappropriated to the Holy Ghost, as implying a certain kind of interior \nmovement, agreeing in that  sense with the property of the Holy Ghost as \nLove. To be written by another is not of the essence of a book considered \nas such; but this belongs to it only as a work produced. So this does not \nimply origin; nor is it personal, but an appropriation to a person. The \nexpression \"Who is\" is appropriated to the person of the Son, not by \nreason of itself, but by reason of an adjunct, inasmuch as, in God's word \nto Moses, was prefigured the delivery of the human race accomplished by \nthe Son. Yet, forasmuch as the word \"Who\" is taken in a relative sense, \nit may sometimes relate to the person of the Son; and in that sense it \nwould be taken personally; as, for instance, were we to say, \"The Son is \nthe begotten 'Who is,'\" inasmuch as \"God begotten is personal.\" But taken \nindefinitely, it is an essential term. And although the pronoun \"this\" \n[iste] seems grammatically to point to a particular person, nevertheless \neverything that we can point to can be grammatically treated as a person, \nalthough in its own nature it is not a person; as we may say, \"this \nstone,\" and \"this ass.\" So, speaking in a grammatical sense, so far as \nthe word \"God\" signifies and stands for the divine essence, the latter \nmay be designated by the pronoun \"this,\" according to Ex. 15:2: \"This is \nmy God, and I will glorify Him.\""

Now, there \nare two principles of difference between the divine persons, and these \nare \"origin\" and \"relation.\" Although these do not really differ, yet \nthey differ in the mode of signification; for \"origin\" is signified by \nway of act, as \"generation\"; and \"relation\" by way of the form, as \n\"paternity.\"\nSome, then, considering that relation follows upon act, have said that \nthe divine hypostases are distinguished by origin, so that we may say \nthat the Father is distinguished from the Son, inasmuch as the former \nbegets and the latter is begotten. Further,  that the relations, or the \nproperties, make known the distinctions of the hypostases or persons as \nresulting therefrom; as also in creatures the properties manifest the \ndistinctions of individuals, which distinctions are caused by the \nmaterial principles.\nThis opinion, however, cannot stand---for two reasons. Firstly, because, \nin order that two things be understood as distinct, their distinction \nmust be understood as resulting from something intrinsic to both; thus in \nthings created it results from their matter or their form. Now origin of \na thing does not designate anything intrinsic, but means the way from \nsomething, or to something; as generation signifies the way to a thing \ngenerated, and as proceeding from the generator. Hence it is not possible \nthat what is generated and the generator should be distinguished by \ngeneration alone; but in the generator and in the thing generated we must \npresuppose whatever makes them to be distinguished from each other. In a \ndivine person there is nothing to presuppose but essence, and relation or \nproperty. Whence, since the persons agree in essence, it only remains to \nbe said that the persons are distinguished from each other by the \nrelations. Secondly: because the distinction of the divine persons is not \nto be so understood as if what is common to them all is divided, because \nthe common essence remains undivided; but the distinguishing principles \nthemselves must constitute the things which are distinct. Now the \nrelations or the properties distinguish or constitute the hypostases or \npersons, inasmuch as they are themselves the subsisting persons; as \npaternity is the Father, and filiation is the Son, because in God the \nabstract and the concrete do not differ. But it is against the nature of \norigin that it should constitute hypostasis or person. For origin taken \nin an active sense signifies proceeding from a subsisting person, so that \nit presupposes the latter; while in a passive sense origin, as \n\"nativity,\" signifies the way to a subsisting person, and as not yet \nconstituting the person.\nIt is therefore better to say that the persons or hypostases are \ndistinguished rather by relations than by origin. For, although in both \nways they are distinguished, nevertheless in our mode of understanding \nthey are distinguished chiefly and firstly by relations; whence this name \n\"Father\" signifies not only a property, but also the hypostasis; whereas \nthis term \"Begetter\" or \"Begetting\" signifies property only; forasmuch as \nthis name \"Father\" signifies the relation which is distinctive and \nconstitutive of the hypostasis; and this term \"Begetter\" or \"Begotten\" \nsignifies the origin which is not distinctive and constitutive of the \nhypostasis.",

The \ndifference between these two abstractions consists in the fact that in \nthe abstraction of the universal from  the particular, that from which \nthe abstraction is made does not remain; for when the difference of \nrationality is removed from man, the man no longer remains in the \nintellect, but animal alone remains. But in the abstraction of the form \nfrom the matter, both the form and the matter remain in the intellect; \nas, for instance, if we abstract the form of a circle from brass, there \nremains in our intellect separately the understanding both of a circle, \nand of brass. Now, although there is no universal nor particular in God, \nnor form and matter, in reality; nevertheless, as regards the mode of \nsignification there is a certain likeness of these things in God; and \nthus Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that \"substance is common and \nhypostasis is particular.\" So, if we speak of the abstraction of the \nuniversal from the particular, the common universal essence remains in \nthe intellect if the properties are removed; but not the hypostasis of \nthe Father, which is, as it were, a particular.\nBut as regards the abstraction of the form from the matter, if the \nnon-personal properties are removed, then the idea of the hypostases and \npersons remains; as, for instance, if the fact of the Father's being \nunbegotten or spirating be mentally abstracted from the Father, the \nFather's hypostasis or person remains.\nIf, however, the personal property be mentally abstracted, the idea of \nthe hypostasis no longer remains. For the personal properties are not to \nbe understood as added to the divine hypostases, as a form is added to a \npre-existing subject: but they carry with them their own \"supposita,\" \ninasmuch as they are themselves subsisting persons; thus paternity is the \nFather Himself. For hypostasis signifies something distinct in God, since \nhypostasis means an individual substance. So, as relation distinguishes \nand constitutes the hypostases, as above explained (Article [2]), it follows \nthat if the personal relations are mentally abstracted, the hypostases no \nlonger remain.

And that the consequent \nrelations which are to be regarded as properties of dignity, constitute \nthe notion of a person, and are thus called \"personal properties.\" Hence, \nif these relations are mentally abstracted, the hypostasis, but not the \npersons, remain.\nBut this is impossible, for two reasons: first, because the relations \ndistinguish and constitute the hypostases, as shown above (Article [2]); \nsecondly, because every hypostasis of a rational nature is a person, as \nappears from the definition of Boethius (De Duab. Nat.) that, \"person is \nthe individual substance of a rational nature.\" Hence, to have hypostasis \nand not person, it would be necessary to abstract the rationality from \nthe nature, but not the property from the person.",

Hence, if the distinguishing property be removed from the person, \nthe hypostasis no longer remains; whereas it would remain were the \nrationality of the nature removed; for both person and hypostasis are \nindividual substances. Consequently, in God the distinguishing relation \nbelongs essentially to both.",

But he speaks in a \ngeneral sense, forasmuch as not every unbegotten being is the Father.

For, \nin the order of intelligence, origin, in the passive sense, simply \nprecedes the personal properties of the person proceeding; because \norigin, as passively understood, signifies the way to a person \nconstituted by the property. Likewise, origin signified actively is prior \nin the order of intelligence to the non-personal relation of the person \noriginating; as the notional act of spiration precedes, in the order of \nintelligence, the unnamed relative property common to the Father and the \nSon. The personal property of the Father can be considered in a twofold \nsense: firstly, as a relation; and thus again in the order of \nintelligence it presupposes the notional act, for relation, as such, is \nfounded upon an act: secondly, according as it constitutes the person; \nand thus the notional act presupposes the relation, as an action \npresupposes a person acting.",

To see this, we must \nconsider that the origin of one thing from another is firstly inferred \nfrom movement: for that anything be changed from its disposition by \nmovement evidently arises from some cause. Hence action, in its primary \nsense, means origin of movement; for, as movement derived from another \ninto a mobile object, is called \"passion,\" so the origin of movement \nitself as beginning from another and terminating in what is moved, is \ncalled \"action.\" Hence, if we take away movement, action implies nothing \nmore than order of origin, in so far as action proceeds from some cause \nor principle to what is from that principle. Consequently, since in God \nno movement exists, the personal action of the one producing a person is \nonly the habitude of the principle to the  person who is from the \nprinciple; which habitudes are the relations, or the notions. \nNevertheless we cannot speak of divine and intelligible things except \nafter the manner of sensible things, whence we derive our knowledge, and \nwherein actions and passions, so far as these imply movement, differ from \nthe relations which result from action and passion, and therefore it was \nnecessary to signify the habitudes of the persons separately after the \nmanner of act, and separately after the manner of relations.

        "ANS": "When anything is said to be, or to be made by the will, \nthis can be understood in two senses. In one sense, the ablative \ndesignates only concomitance, as I can say that I am a man by my \nwill---that is, I will to be a man; and in this way it can be said that \nthe Father begot the Son by will; as also He is God by will, because He \nwills to be God, and wills to beget the Son. In the other sense, the \nablative imports the habitude of a principle as it is said that the \nworkman works by his will, as the will is  the principle of his work; and \nthus in that sense it must be said the God the Father begot the Son, not \nby His will; but that He produced the creature by His will. Whence in the \nbook De Synod, it is said: \"If anyone say that the Son was made by the \nWill of God, as a creature is said to be made, let him be anathema.\" The \nreason of this is that will and nature differ in their manner of \ncausation, in such a way that nature is determined to one, while the will \nis not determined to one; and this because the effect is assimilated to \nthe form of the agent, whereby the latter acts. Now it is manifest that \nof one thing there is only one natural form whereby it exists; and hence \nsuch as it is itself, such also is its work. But the form whereby the \nwill acts is not only one, but many, according to the number of ideas \nunderstood. Hence the quality of the will's action does not depend on the \nquality of the agent, but on the agent's will and understanding. So the \nwill is the principle of those things which may be this way or that way; \nwhereas of those things which can be only in one way, the principle is \nnature. What, however, can exist in different ways is far from the divine \nnature, whereas it belongs to the nature of a created being; because God \nis of Himself necessary being, whereas a creature is made from nothing. \nThus, the Arians, wishing to prove the Son to be a creature, said that \nthe Father begot the Son by will, taking will in the sense of principle. \nBut we, on the contrary, must assert that the Father begot the Son, not \nby will, but by nature. Wherefore Hilary says (De Synod.): \"The will of \nGod gave to all creatures their substance: but perfect birth gave the Son \na nature derived from a substance impassible and unborn.

Likewise we can object concerning the Holy Ghost, by \nreason of what is said (Zach. 12:1): \"Thus saith the Lord Who stretcheth \nforth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and formeth \nthe spirit of man within him\"; and (Amos 4:13) according to another \nversion [*The Septuagint]: \"I Who form the earth, and create the spirit.\"",

For it was explained above (Question [27], Article [2]; Question [33], Articles [2],3) that paternity, filiation and nativity really and truly exist in God. \nNow, this is the difference between true \"generation,\" whereby one \nproceeds from another as a son, and \"making,\" that the maker makes \nsomething out of external matter, as a carpenter makes a bench out of \nwood, whereas a man begets a son from himself. Now, as a created workman \nmakes a thing out of matter, so God makes things out of nothing, as will \nbe shown later on (Question [45], Article [1]), not as if this nothing were a part of \nthe substance of the thing made, but because the whole substance of a \nthing is produced by Him without anything else whatever presupposed. So, \nwere the Son to proceed from the Father as out of nothing, then the Son \nwould be to the Father what the thing made is to the maker, whereto, as \nis evident, the name of filiation would not apply except by a kind of \nsimilitude. Thus, if the Son of God proceeds from the Father out of \nnothing, He could not be properly and truly called the Son, whereas the \ncontrary is stated (1 Jn. 5:20): \"That we may be in His true Son Jesus \nChrist.\" Therefore the true Son of God is not from nothing; nor is He \nmade, but begotten.\nThat certain creatures made by God out of nothing are called sons of God \nis to be taken in a metaphorical sense, according to a certain likeness \nof assimilation to Him Who is the true Son. Whence, as He is the only \ntrue and natural Son of God, He is called the \"only begotten,\" according \nto Jn. 1:18, \"The only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, \nHe hath declared Him\"; and so as others are entitled sons of adoption by \ntheir similitude to Him, He is called the \"first begotten,\" according to \nRm. 8:29: \"Whom He foreknew He also predestinated to be made conformable \nto the image of His Son, that He might be the first born of many \nbrethren.\" Therefore the Son of God is begotten of the substance of the \nFather, but not in the same way as man is born of man; for a part of the \nhuman substance in generation passes into the substance of the one \nbegotten, whereas the divine nature cannot be parted; whence it \nnecessarily follows that the Father in begetting the Son does not \ntransmit any part of His nature, but communicates His whole nature to \nHim, the distinction only of origin remaining as explained above (Question [40], Article [2]).",

So we may explain them otherwise, by \nobserving that the preposition \"of\" [de] always denotes \nconsubstantiality. We do not say that a house is \"of\" [de] the builder, \nsince he is not the consubstantial cause. We can say, however, that \nsomething is \"of\" another, if this is its consubstantial principle, no \nmatter in what way it is so, whether it be an active principle, as the \nson is said to be \"of\" the father, or a material principle, as a knife is \n\"of\" iron; or a formal principle, but in those things only in which the \nforms are subsisting, and not accidental to another, for we can say that \nan angel is \"of\" an intellectual nature.

        "RP4": "When we say \"Wisdom was created,\" this may be understood \nnot of Wisdom which is the Son of God, but of created wisdom given by God \nto creatures: for it is said, \"He created her [namely, Wisdom] in the \nHoly Ghost, and He poured her out over all His works\" (Ecclus. 1:9,10). \nNor is it inconsistent for Scripture in one text to speak of the Wisdom \nbegotten and wisdom created, for wisdom created is a kind of \nparticipation of the uncreated Wisdom. The saying may also be referred to \nthe created nature assumed by the Son, so that the sense be, \"From the \nbeginning and before the world was I made\"---that is, I was foreseen as \nunited to the creature. Or the mention of wisdom as both created and \nbegotten insinuates into our minds the mode of the divine generation; for \nin generation what is generated receives the nature of the generator and \nthis pertains to perfection; whereas in creation the Creator is  not \nchanged, but the creature does not receive the Creator's nature. Thus the \nSon is called both created and begotten, in order that from the idea of \ncreation the immutability of the Father may be understood, and from \ngeneration the unity of nature in the Father and the Son. In this way \nHilary expounds the sense of this text of Scripture (De Synod.). The \nother passages quoted do not refer to the Holy Ghost, but to the created \nspirit, sometimes called wind, sometimes air, sometimes the breath of \nman, sometimes also the soul, or any other invisible substance."

In \nevery begetter, therefore, that is the power of begetting in which the \nbegotten is like the begetter.\nNow the Son of God is like the Father, who begets Him, in the divine \nnature. Wherefore the divine nature in the Father is in Him the power of \nbegetting. And so Hilary says (De Trin. v): \"The birth of God cannot but \ncontain that nature from which it proceeded; for He cannot subsist other \nthan God, Who subsists from no other source than God.\"\nWe must therefore conclude that the power of begetting signifies \nprincipally the divine essence as the Master says (Sent. i, D, vii), and \nnot the relation only. Nor does it signify the essence as identified with \nthe relation, so as to signify both equally.

And in this sense Damascene says (De Fide \nOrth. i, 18) that generation is the \"work of nature,\" not of nature \ngenerating, but of nature, as being that by which the generator \ngenerates.

Now the agent is distinct from that which it makes, and the \ngenerator from that which it generates: but that by which the generator \ngenerates is common to generated and generator, and so much more \nperfectly, as the generation is more perfect.

For since the divine Persons are the relations \nthemselves as subsistent, there would not be several Fathers, or several \nSons in God, unless there were more than one paternity, or more than one \nfiliation. And this, indeed, would not be possible except owing to a \nmaterial distinction: since forms of one species are not multiplied \nexcept in respect of matter, which is not in God. Wherefore there can be \nbut one subsistent filiation in God: just as there could be but one \nsubsistent whiteness.\nThe second reason is taken from the manner of the processions. For God \nunderstands and wills all things by one simple act. Wherefore there can \nbe but one person proceeding after the manner of word, which person is \nthe Son; and but one person proceeding  after the manner of love, which \nperson is the Holy Ghost.\nThe third reason is taken from the manner in which the persons proceed. \nFor the persons proceed naturally, as we have said (Article [2]), and nature is \ndetermined to one.\nThe fourth reason is taken from the perfection of the divine persons. \nFor this reason is the Son perfect, that the entire divine filiation is \ncontained in Him, and that there is but one Son.

But in  the divine persons \nthere is no quantity, neither continuous intrinsic quantity, which we \ncall size, nor continuous extrinsic quantity, which we call place and \ntime. Nor can there be equality by reason of discrete quantity, because \ntwo persons are more than one. Therefore equality is not becoming to the \ndivine persons.",
        "OB2": "Further, the divine persons are of one essence, as we have said \n(Question [39], Article [2]). Now essence is signified by way of form.

        "OB3": "Further, things wherein there is to be found equality, are equal \nto one another, for equality is reciprocal. But the divine persons cannot \nbe said to be equal to one another. For as Augustine says (De Trin. vi, \n10): \"If an image answers perfectly to that whereof it is the image, it \nmay be said to be equal to it; but that which it represents cannot be \nsaid to be equal to the image.\" But the Son is the image of the Father; \nand so the Father is not equal to the Son. Therefore equality is not to \nbe found among the divine persons.",

        "ANS": "We must needs admit equality among the divine persons. \nFor, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. x, text 15,16, 17), equality \nsignifies the negation of greater or less. Now we cannot admit anything \ngreater or less in the divine persons; for as Boethius says (De Trin. i): \n\"They must needs admit a difference [namely, of Godhead] who speak of \neither increase or decrease, as the Arians do, who sunder the Trinity by \ndistinguishing degrees as of numbers, thus involving a plurality.\" Now \nthe reason of this is that unequal things cannot have the same quantity. \nBut quantity, in God, is nothing else than His essence. Wherefore it \nfollows, that if there were any inequality in the divine persons, they \nwould not have the same essence; and thus the three persons would not be \none God; which is impossible. We must therefore admit equality among the \ndivine persons.",
        "RP1": "Quantity is twofold. There is quantity of \"bulk\" or \ndimensive quantity, which is to be found only in corporeal things, and \nhas, therefore, no place in God. There is also quantity of \"virtue,\" \nwhich is measured according to the perfection of some nature or form: to \nthis sort of quantity we allude when we speak of something as being more, \nor less, hot; forasmuch as it is more or less, perfect in heat. Now this \nvirtual quantity is measured firstly by its source---that is, by the \nperfection of that form or nature: such is the greatness of spiritual \nthings, just as we speak  of great heat on account of its intensity and \nperfection. And so Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 18) that \"in things which \nare great, but not in bulk, to be greater is to be better,\" for the more \nperfect a thing is the better it is. Secondly, virtual quantity is \nmeasured by the effects of the form. Now the first effect of form is \nbeing, for everything has being by reason of its form. The second effect \nis operation, for every agent acts through its form. Consequently virtual \nquantity is measured both in regard to being and in regard to action: in \nregard to being, forasmuch as things of a more perfect nature are of \nlonger duration; and in regard to action, forasmuch as things of a more \nperfect nature are more powerful to act. And so as Augustine (Fulgentius, \nDe Fide ad Petrum i) says: \"We understand equality to be in the Father, \nSon and Holy Ghost, inasmuch as no one of them either precedes in \neternity, or excels in greatness, or surpasses in power.\"",
        "RP2": "Where we have equality in respect of virtual quantity, \nequality includes likeness and something besides, because it excludes \nexcess. For whatever things have a common form may be said to be alike, \neven if they do not participate in that form equally, just as the air may \nbe said to be like fire in heat; but they cannot be said to be equal if \none participates in the form more perfectly than another. And because not \nonly is the same nature in both Father and Son, but also is it in both in \nperfect equality, therefore we say not only that the Son is like to the \nFather, in order to exclude the error of Eunomius, but also that He is \nequal to the Father to exclude the error of Arius.",
        "RP3": "Equality and likeness in God may be designated in two \nways---namely, by nouns and by verbs. When designated by nouns, equality \nin the divine persons is mutual, and so is likeness; for the Son is equal \nand like to the Father, and conversely. This is because the divine \nessence is not more the Father's than the Son's. Wherefore, just as the \nSon has the greatness of the Father, and is therefore equal to the \nFather, so the Father has the greatness of the Son, and is therefore \nequal to the Son. But in reference to creatures, Dionysius says (Div. \nNom. ix): \"Equality and likeness are not mutual.\" For effects are said to \nbe like their causes, inasmuch as they have the form of their causes; but \nnot conversely, for the form is principally in the cause, and secondarily \nin the effect.\nBut verbs signify equality with movement. And although movement is not \nin God, there is something that receives. Since, therefore, the Son \nreceives from the Father, this, namely, that He is equal to the Father, \nand not conversely, for this reason we say that the Son is equalled to \nthe Father, but not conversely.",
        "RP4": "In the divine persons there is nothing for us to consider \nbut the essence which they have in common and the relations in which they \nare distinct. Now equality implies both ---namely, distinction of \npersons, for nothing can be said to be equal to itself; and unity of \nessence, since for this reason are the persons equal to one another, that \nthey are of the same  greatness and essence. Now it is clear that the \nrelation of a thing to itself is not a real relation. Nor, again, is one \nrelation referred to another by a further relation: for when we say that \npaternity is opposed to filiation, opposition is not a relation mediating \nbetween paternity and filiation. For in both these cases relation would \nbe multiplied indefinitely. Therefore equality and likeness in the divine \npersons is not a real relation distinct from the personal relations: but \nin its concept it includes both the relations which distinguish the \npersons, and the unity of essence. For this reason the Master says (Sent. \ni, D, xxxi) that in these \"it is only the terms that are relative.\""

The \nthird is like the mark or impression made by a seal; wherein is wanting \nconsubstantiality and executive power. The fourth is the infusion of a \ngood will from God; wherein also consubstantiality is wanting. The fifth \nis the emanation of an accident from its subject; but the accident has no \nsubsistence. The sixth is the abstraction of a species from matter, as \nsense receives the species from the sensible object; wherein is wanting \nequality of spiritual simplicity. The seventh is the exciting of the will \nby knowledge, which excitation is merely temporal. The eighth is \ntransformation, as an image is made of brass; which transformation is \nmaterial. The ninth is motion from a mover; and here again we have effect \nand cause. The tenth is the taking of species from genera; but this mode \nhas no place in God, for the Father is not predicated of the Son as the \ngenus of a species. The eleventh is the realization of an idea [ideatio], \nas an external coffer arises from the one in the mind. The twelfth is \nbirth, as a man is begotten of his father; which implies priority and \nposteriority of time. Thus it is clear that equality of nature or of time \nis absent in every mode whereby one thing is from another.

On the \npart of the agent this happens differently as regards free agents and \nnatural agents. In free agents, on account of the choice of time; for as \na free agent can choose the form it gives to the effect, as stated above \n(Question [41], Article [2]), so it can choose the time in which to produce its effect. \nIn natural agents, however, the same happens from the agent not having \nits perfection of natural power from the very first, but obtaining it \nafter a certain time; as, for instance, a man is not able to generate \nfrom the very first. Considered on the part of action, anything derived \nfrom a principle cannot exist simultaneously with its principle when the \naction is successive. So, given that an agent, as soon as it exists, \nbegins to act thus, the effect would not exist in the same instant, but \nin the instant of the action's termination. Now it is manifest, according \nto what has been said (Question [41], Article [2]), that the Father does not beget the \nSon by will, but by nature; and also that the Father's nature was perfect \nfrom eternity; and again that the action whereby the Father produces the \nSon is not successive, because thus the Son would be successively \ngenerated, and this generation would be material, and accompanied with \nmovement; which is quite impossible.

But since in men generation is a certain kind of transmutation \nof one proceeding from potentiality to act, it follows that a man is not \nequal at first to the father who begets him, but attains to equality by \ndue growth, unless owing to a defect in the principle of generation it \nshould happen otherwise. From what precedes (Question [27], Article [2]; Question [33], Articles [2],3), it is evident that in God there exist real true paternity and \nfiliation. Nor can we say that the power of generation in the Father was \ndefective, nor that the Son of God arrived at perfection in a successive \nmanner and by change. Therefore we must say that the Son was eternally \nequal to the Father in greatness. Hence, Hilary says (De Synod. Can. 27): \n\"Remove bodily weakness, remove the beginning of conception, remove pain \nand all human shortcomings, then every son, by reason of his natural \nnativity, is the father's equal, because he has a like nature.\"",

As, therefore, the same \nessence, which in the Father is paternity, in the Son is filiation, so \nthe same dignity which, in the Father is paternity, in the Son is \nfiliation. It is thus true to say that the Son possesses whatever dignity \nthe Father has; but we cannot argue---\"the Father has paternity, \ntherefore the Son has paternity,\" for there is a transition from \nsubstance to relation.

The visible mission was directed to Christ at the time of His \nbaptism by the figure of a dove, a fruitful animal, to show forth in \nChrist the authority of the giver of grace by spiritual regeneration; \nhence the Father's voice spoke, \"This is My beloved Son\" (Mt. 3:17), that \nothers might be regenerated to the likeness of the only Begotten. The  \nTransfiguration showed it forth in the appearance of a bright cloud, to \nshow the exuberance of doctrine; and hence it was said, \"Hear ye Him\" \n(Mt. 17:5). To the apostles the mission was directed in the form of \nbreathing to show forth the power of their ministry in the dispensation \nof the sacraments; and hence it was said, \"Whose sins you shall forgive, \nthey are forgiven\" (Jn. 20:23): and again under the sign of fiery tongues \nto show forth the office of teaching; whence it is said that, \"they began \nto speak with divers tongues\" (Acts 2:4). The visible mission of the Holy \nGhost was fittingly not sent to the fathers of the Old Testament, because \nthe visible mission of the Son was to be accomplished before that of the \nHoly Ghost; since the Holy Ghost manifests the Son, as the Son manifests \nthe Father. Visible apparitions of the divine persons were, however, \ngiven to the Fathers of the Old Testament which, indeed, cannot be called \nvisible missions; because, according to Augustine (De Trin. ii, 17), they \nwere not sent to designate the indwelling of the divine person by grace, \nbut for the manifestation of something else.",

As God, therefore, in a certain way has demonstrated \nHimself and His eternal processions to men by visible creatures, \naccording to certain signs; so was it fitting that the invisible missions \nalso of the divine persons should be made manifest by some visible \ncreatures.\nThis mode of manifestation applies in different ways to the Son and to \nthe Holy Ghost. For it belongs to the Holy Ghost, Who proceeds as Love, \nto be the gift of sanctification; to the Son as the principle of the Holy \nGhost, it belongs to the author of this sanctification. Thus the Son has \nbeen sent visibly as the author of sanctification; the Holy Ghost as the \nsign of sanctification.",

But whoever saw the dove and the fire, saw them by their eyes. \nNor, again, has the Holy Ghost the same relation to these images that the \nSon has to the rock, because it is said, \"The rock was Christ\" (1 Cor. 10:4). For that rock was already created, and after the manner of an \naction was named Christ, Whom it typified; whereas the dove and the fire \nsuddenly appeared to signify only what was happening. They seem, however, \nto be like to the flame of the burning bush seen by Moses and to the \ncolumn which the people followed in the desert, and to the lightning and \nthunder issuing forth when the law was given on  the mountain. For the \npurpose of the bodily appearances of those things was that they might \nsignify, and then pass away.\" Thus the visible mission is neither \ndisplayed by prophetic vision, which belongs to the imagination, and not \nto the body, nor by the sacramental signs of the Old and New Testament, \nwherein certain pre-existing things are employed to signify something. \nBut the Holy Ghost is said to be sent visibly, inasmuch as He showed \nHimself in certain creatures as in signs especially made for that purpose.",

Nor was such a visible \ncreature, formed for such a purpose, necessarily assumed by the Holy \nGhost into the unity of His person, since it was not assumed or used for \nthe purpose of action, but only for the purpose of a sign; and so \nlikewise it was not required to last beyond what its use required."

Augustine, however, says (De \nTrin. ii, 5) that the Son is sent by Himself, and by the Holy Ghost; and \nthe Holy Ghost is sent by Himself, and by the Son; so that to be sent in \nGod does not apply to each person, but only to the person proceeding from\nanother, whereas to send belongs to each person.\nThere is some truth in both of these opinions; because when a person is \ndescribed as being sent, the person Himself existing from another is \ndesignated, with the visible or invisible effect, applicable to the \nmission of the divine person. Thus if the sender be designated as the \nprinciple of the person sent, in this sense not each person sends, but \nthat person only Who is the principle of that person who is sent; and \nthus the Son is sent only by the Father; and the Holy Ghost by the Father \nand the Son. If, however, the person sending is understood as the \nprinciple of the effect implied in the mission, in that sense the whole \nTrinity sends the person sent.

Therefore all beings apart \nfrom God are not their own being, but are beings by participation. \nTherefore it must be that all things which are diversified by the diverse \nparticipation of being, so as to be more or less perfect, are caused by \none First Being, Who possesses being most perfectly.\nHence Plato said (Parmen. xxvi) that unity must come before multitude; \nand Aristotle said (Metaph. ii, text 4) that whatever is greatest in \nbeing and greatest in truth, is the cause of every being and of every \ntruth; just as whatever is the greatest in heat is the cause of all heat.",

But as action and \npassion coincide as to the substance of motion, and differ only according \nto diverse relations (Phys. iii, text 20,21), it must follow that when \nmotion is withdrawn, only diverse relations remain in the Creator and in \nthe creature.

For \nthe more universal effects must be reduced to the more universal and \nprior causes. Now among all effects the most universal is being itself: \nand hence it must be the proper effect of the first and most universal \ncause, and that is God. Hence also it is said (De Causis prop., iii) that \n\"neither intelligence nor the soul gives us being, except inasmuch as it \nworks by divine operation.\" Now to produce being absolutely, not as this \nor that being, belongs to creation. Hence it is manifest that creation is \nthe proper act of God alone.\nIt happens, however, that something participates the proper action of \nanother, not by its own power, but instrumentally, inasmuch as it acts by \nthe power of another; as air can heat and ignite by the power of fire. \nAnd so some have supposed that although creation is the proper act of the \nuniversal cause, still some inferior cause acting by the power of the \nfirst cause, can create. And thus Avicenna asserted that the first \nseparate substance created by God created another after itself, and the \nsubstance of the world and its soul; and that the substance of the world \ncreates the matter of inferior bodies. And in the same manner the Master \nsays (Sent. iv, D, 5) that God can communicate to a creature the power of \ncreating, so that the latter can create ministerially, not by its own \npower.\nBut such a thing cannot be, because the secondary instrumental cause \ndoes not participate the action of the superior cause, except inasmuch as \nby something proper to itself it acts dispositively to the effect of the \nprincipal agent. If therefore it effects nothing, according to what is \nproper to itself, it is used to no purpose; nor would there be any need \nof certain instruments for certain actions. Thus we see that a saw, in \ncutting wood, which it does by the property of its own form, produces the \nform of a bench, which is the proper effect of the principal agent. Now \nthe proper effect of God creating is what is presupposed to all other \neffects, and that is absolute being. Hence nothing else can act \ndispositively and instrumentally to this effect, since creation is not \nfrom anything presupposed, which can be disposed by the action of the \ninstrumental agent. So therefore it is impossible for any creature to \ncreate, either by its own power or instrumentally---that is, \nministerially.\nAnd above all it is absurd to suppose that a body can create, for no \nbody acts except by touching or moving; and thus it requires in its \naction some pre-existing thing, which can be touched or moved, which is \ncontrary to the very idea of creation.",

For an individual man cannot be the cause of human nature \nabsolutely, because he would then be the cause of himself; but he is the \ncause of human nature being in the man begotten; and thus he presupposes \nin his action a determinate matter whereby he is an individual man. But \nas an individual man participates human nature, so every created being \nparticipates, so  to speak, the nature of being; for God alone is His own \nbeing, as we have said above (Question [7], Articles [1],2). Therefore no created being \ncan produce a being absolutely, except forasmuch as it causes \"being\" in \n\"this\": and so it is necessary to presuppose that whereby a thing is this \nthing, before the action whereby it makes its own likeness. But in an \nimmaterial substance it is not possible to presuppose anything whereby it \nis this thing; because it is what it is by its form, whereby it has \nbeing, since it is a subsisting form. Therefore an immaterial substance \ncannot produce another immaterial substance like to itself as regards its \nbeing, but only as regards some added perfection; as we may say that a \nsuperior angel illuminates an inferior, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. \niv, x). In this way even in heaven there is paternity, as the Apostle \nsays (Eph. 3:15): \"From whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is \nnamed.\" From which evidently appears that no created being can cause \nanything, unless something is presupposed; which is against the very idea \nof creation.",

For if a greater power is required in the agent in \nproportion to the distance of the potentiality from the act, it follows \nthat the power of that which produces something from no presupposed \npotentiality is infinite, because there is no proportion between \"no \npotentiality\" and the potentiality presupposed by the power of a natural \nagent, as there is no proportion between \"not being\" and \"being.\" And \nbecause no creature has simply an infinite power, any more than it has an \ninfinite being, as was proved above (Question [7], Article [2]), it follows that no \ncreature can create."

Again, the reason \nfor this particular appropriation may be taken from the common notion of \nthe appropriation of the essential attributes.

        "OB1": "It would seem that the universe of creatures, called the world, \nhad no beginning, but existed from eternity. For everything which begins \nto exist, is a possible being before it exists: otherwise it would be \nimpossible for it to exist. If therefore the world began to exist, it was \na possible being before it began to exist. But possible being is matter, \nwhich is in potentiality to existence, which results from a form, and to \nnon-existence, which results from privation of form. If therefore the \nworld began to exist, matter must have existed before the world. But \nmatter cannot exist without form: while the matter of the world with its \nform is the world. Therefore the world existed before it began to exist: \nwhich is impossible.\n: Further, eternal action postulates an eternal effect. But the \naction of God is His substance, which is eternal. Therefore the world is \neternal.",
        "OB2": "Further, nothing which has power to be always, sometimes is and \nsometimes is not; because so far as the power of a thing extends so long \nis exists. But every incorruptible thing  has power to be always; for its \npower does not extend to any determinate time. Therefore no incorruptible \nthing sometimes is, and sometimes is not: but everything which has a \nbeginning at some time is, and at some time is not; therefore no \nincorruptible thing begins to exist. But there are many incorruptible \nthings in the world, as the celestial bodies and all intellectual \nsubstances. Therefore the world did not begin to exist.",
        "OB3": "Further, what is unbegotten has no beginning. But the Philosopher \n(Phys. i, text 82) proves that matter is unbegotten, and also (De Coelo \net Mundo i, text 20) that the heaven is unbegotten. Therefore the \nuniverse did not begin to exist.",
        "OB4": "Further, a vacuum is where there is not a body, but there might \nbe. But if the world began to exist, there was first no body where the \nbody of the world now is; and yet it could be there, otherwise it would \nnot be there now. Therefore before the world there was a vacuum; which is \nimpossible.",
        "OB5": "Further, nothing begins anew to be moved except through either \nthe mover or the thing moved being otherwise than it was before. But what \nis otherwise now than it was before, is moved. Therefore before every new \nmovement there was a previous movement. Therefore movement always was; \nand therefore also the thing moved always was, because movement is only \nin a movable thing.\nObjection 6: Further, every mover is either natural or voluntary. But neither \nbegins to move except by some pre-existing movement. For nature always \nmoves in the same manner: hence unless some change precede either in the \nnature of the mover, or in the movable thing, there cannot arise from the \nnatural mover a movement which was not there before. And the will, \nwithout itself being changed, puts off doing what it proposes to do; but \nthis can be only by some imagined change, at least on the part of time. \nThus he who wills to make a house tomorrow, and not today, awaits \nsomething which will be tomorrow, but is not today; and at least awaits \nfor today to pass, and for tomorrow to come; and this cannot be without \nchange, because time is the measure of movement. Therefore it remains \nthat before every new movement, there was a previous movement; and so the \nsame conclusion follows as before.\nObjection 7: Further, whatever is always in its beginning, and always in its \nend, cannot cease and cannot begin; because what begins is not in its \nend, and what ceases is not in its beginning. But time always is in its \nbeginning and end, because there is no time except \"now\" which is the end \nof the past and the beginning of the future. Therefore time cannot begin \nor end, and consequently neither can movement, the measure of what is \ntime.\nObjection 8: Further, God is before the world either in the order of nature \nonly, or also by duration. If in the order of nature only, therefore, \nsince God is eternal, the world also is eternal. But if God is prior by \nduration; since what is prior and posterior in duration constitutes time, \nit follows that time existed before the  world, which is impossible.\nObjection 9: Further, if there is a sufficient cause, there is an effect; for \na cause to which there is no effect is an imperfect cause, requiring \nsomething else to make the effect follow. But God is the sufficient cause \nof the world; being the final cause, by reason of His goodness, the \nexemplar cause by reason of His wisdom, and the efficient cause, by \nreason of His power as appears from the above (Question [44], Articles [2],3,4). Since \ntherefore God is eternal, the world is also eternal.\nReply to  The first mover was always in the same state: but the first \nmovable thing was not always so, because it began to be whereas hitherto \nit was not. This, however, was not through change, but by creation, which \nis not change, as said above (Question [45], Article [2], as 2). Hence it is evident \nthat this reason, which Aristotle gives (Phys. viii), is valid against \nthose who admitted the existence of eternal movable things, but not \neternal movement, as appears from the opinions of Anaxagoras and \nEmpedocles. But we hold that from the moment that movable things began to \nexist movement also existed.\nReply to Objection 6: The first agent is a voluntary agent. And although He had \nthe eternal will to produce some effect, yet He did not produce an \neternal effect. Nor is it necessary for some change to be presupposed, \nnot even on account of imaginary time. For we must take into \nconsideration the difference between a particular agent, that presupposes \nsomething and produces something else, and the universal agent, who \nproduces the whole. The particular agent produces the form, and \npresupposes the matter; and hence it is necessary that it introduce the \nform in due proportion into a suitable matter. Hence it is correct to say \nthat it introduces the form into such matter, and not into another, on \naccount of the different kinds of matter. But it is not correct to say so \nof God Who produces form and matter together: whereas it is correct to \nsay of Him that He produces matter fitting to the form and to the end. \nNow, a particular agent presupposes time just as it presupposes matter. \nHence it is correctly described as acting in time \"after\"  and not in \ntime \"before,\" according to an imaginary succession of time after time. \nBut the universal agent who produces the thing and time also, is not \ncorrectly described as acting now, and not before, according to an \nimaginary succession of time succeeding time, as if time were presupposed \nto His action; but He must be considered as giving time to His effect as \nmuch as and when He willed, and according to what was fitting to \ndemonstrate His power. For the world leads more evidently to the \nknowledge of the divine creating power, if it was not always, than if it \nhad always been; since everything which was not always manifestly has a \ncause; whereas this is not so manifest of what always was.\nReply to Objection 7: As is stated (Phys. iv, text 99), \"before\" and \"after\" \nbelong to time, according as they are in movement. Hence beginning and \nend in time must be taken in the same way as in movement. Now, granted \nthe eternity of movement, it is necessary that any given moment in \nmovement be a beginning and an end of movement; which need not be if \nmovement be a beginning. The same applies to the \"now\" of time. Thus it \nappears that the idea of the instant \"now,\" as being always the beginning \nand end of time, presupposes the eternity of time and movement. Hence \nAristotle brings forward this reason (Phys. viii, text 10) against those \nwho asserted the eternity of time, but denied the eternity of movement.\nReply to Objection 8: God is prior to the world by priority of duration. But the \nword \"prior\" signifies priority not of time, but of eternity. Or we may \nsay that it signifies the eternity of imaginary time, and not of time \nreally existing; thus, when we say that above heaven there is nothing, \nthe word \"above\" signifies only an imaginary place, according as it is \npossible to imagine other dimensions beyond those of the heavenly body.\nReply to Objection 9: As the effect follows from the cause that acts by nature, \naccording to the mode of its form, so likewise it follows from the \nvoluntary agent, according to the form preconceived and determined by the \nagent, as appears from what was said above (Question [19], Article [4]; Question [41], Article [2]). \nTherefore, although God was from eternity the sufficient cause of the \nworld, we should not say that the world was produced by Him, except as \npreordained by His will---that is, that it should have being after not \nbeing, in order more manifestly to declare its author.",

Now it was shown above (Question [19], Article [3]), that, absolutely speaking, \nit is not necessary that God should will anything except Himself. It is \nnot therefore necessary for God to will that the world should always \nexist; but the world exists forasmuch as God wills it to exist, since the \nbeing of the world depends on the will of God, as on its cause. It is not \ntherefore necessary for the world to be always; and hence it cannot be \nproved by demonstration.\nNor are Aristotle's reasons (Phys. viii) simply, but relatively, \ndemonstrative---viz. in order to contradict the reasons of some of the \nancients who asserted that the world began to exist in some quite \nimpossible manner.

Firstly, because, both in \nPhys. viii and in De Coelo i, text 101, he premises some opinions, as \nthose of Anaxagoras, Empedocles and Plato, and brings forward reasons to \nrefute them. Secondly, because wherever he speaks of this subject, he \nquotes the testimony of the ancients, which is not the way of a \ndemonstrator, but of one persuading of what is probable.

But in agents \nacting by will, what is conceived and preordained is to be taken as the \nform, which is the principle of action.

But it is impossible to pass \nthrough an infinite medium. Therefore we should never have arrived at \nthis present day; which is manifestly false.\nObjection 7: Further, if the world was eternal, generation also was eternal. \nTherefore one man was begotten of another in an infinite series. But the \nfather is the efficient cause of the son (Phys. ii, text 5). Therefore in \nefficient causes there could be an infinite series, which is disproved \n(Metaph. ii, text 5).\nObjection 8: Further, if the world and generation always were, there have been \nan infinite number of men. But man's soul is immortal: therefore an \ninfinite number of human souls would actually now exist, which is \nimpossible. Therefore it can be known with certainty that the world \nbegan, and not only is it known by faith.\nReply to  Even supposing that the world always was, it would not be \nequal to God in eternity, as Boethius says (De Consol. v, 6); because the \ndivine Being is all being simultaneously without succession; but with the \nworld it is otherwise.\nReply to Objection 6: Passage is always understood as being from term to term. \nWhatever bygone day we choose, from it to the present day there is a \nfinite number of days which can be passed through. The objection is \nfounded on the idea that, given two extremes, there is an infinite number \nof mean terms.\nReply to Objection 7: In efficient causes it is impossible to proceed to infinity \n\"per se\"---thus, there cannot be an infinite number of causes that are \n\"per se\" required for a certain effect; for instance, that a stone be \nmoved by a stick, the stick by the hand, and so on to infinity. But it is \nnot impossible to proceed to infinity \"accidentally\" as regards efficient \ncauses; for instance, if all the causes thus infinitely multiplied should \nhave the order of only one cause, their multiplication being accidental, \nas an artificer acts by means of many hammers accidentally, because one \nafter the other may be broken. It is accidental, therefore, that one \nparticular hammer acts after the action of another; and likewise it is \naccidental to this particular man as generator to be generated by another \nman; for he generates as a man, and not as the son of another man. For \nall men generating hold one grade in efficient causes---viz. the grade of \na particular generator. Hence it is not impossible for a man to be \ngenerated by man to infinity; but such a thing would be impossible if the \ngeneration of this man depended upon this man, and on an elementary body, \nand on the sun, and so on to infinity.\nReply to Objection 8: Those who hold the eternity of the world evade this reason \nin many ways. For some do not think it impossible for there to be an \nactual infinity of souls, as appears from the Metaphysics of Algazel, who \nsays that such a thing is an accidental infinity. But this was disproved \nabove (Question [7], Article [4]). Some say that the soul is corrupted with the body. \nAnd some say that of all souls  only one will remain. But others, as \nAugustine says [*Serm. xiv, De Temp. 4,5; De Haeres., haeres. 46; De Civ. \nDei xii. 13], asserted on this account a circuit of souls---viz. that \nsouls separated from their bodies return again thither after a course of \ntime; a fuller consideration of which matters will be given later (Question [75], Article [2]; Question [118], Article [6]). But be it noted that this argument considers only a \nparticular case. Hence one might say that the world was eternal, or least \nsome creature, as an angel, but not man.

Now \neverything according to its species is abstracted from \"here\" and \"now\"; \nwhence it is said that universals are everywhere and always. Hence it \ncannot be demonstrated that man, or heaven, or a stone were not always. \nLikewise neither can it be demonstrated on the part of the efficient \ncause, which acts by will. For the will of God cannot be investigated by \nreason, except as regards those things which God must will of necessity; \nand what He wills about creatures is not among these, as was said above \n(Question [19], Article [3]). But the divine will can be manifested by revelation, on \nwhich faith rests. Hence that the world began to exist is an object of \nfaith, but not of demonstration or science.

But \nif the action is instantaneous and not successive, it is not necessary \nfor the maker to be prior to the thing made in duration as appears in the \ncase of illumination.

Democritus, for instance, and all the ancient natural \nphilosophers, who admitted no cause but matter, attributed it to matter \nalone; and in their opinion the distinction of things comes from chance \naccording to the movement of matter. Anaxagoras, however, attributed the \ndistinction and multitude of things to matter and to the agent together; \nand he said that the intellect distinguishes things by extracting what is \nmixed up in matter.\nBut this cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because, as was shown \nabove (Question [44], Article [2]), even matter itself was created by God. Hence we must \nreduce whatever distinction comes from matter to a higher cause. \nSecondly, because matter is for the sake of the form, and not the form \nfor the matter, and the distinction of things comes from their proper \nforms. Therefore the distinction of things is not on account of the \nmatter; but rather, on the contrary, created matter is formless, in order \nthat it may be accommodated to different forms.\nOthers have attributed the distinction of things to secondary agents, as \ndid Avicenna, who said that God by understanding Himself, produced the \nfirst intelligence; in which, forasmuch as it was not its own being, \nthere is necessarily composition of potentiality and act, as will appear \nlater (Question [50], Article [3]). And so the first intelligence, inasmuch as it \nunderstood the first cause, produced the second intelligence; and in so \nfar as it understood itself as in potentiality it produced the heavenly \nbody, which causes movement, and inasmuch as it understood itself as \nhaving actuality it produced the soul of the heavens.\nBut this opinion cannot stand, for two reasons. First, because it was \nshown above (Question [45], Article [5]) that to create belongs to God alone, and hence \nwhat can be caused only by creation is produced by God alone---viz. all \nthose things which are not subject to generation and corruption. \nSecondly, because, according to this opinion, the universality of things \nwould not proceed from the intention of the first agent, but from the \nconcurrence of many active causes; and such an effect we can describe \nonly as being produced by chance. Therefore, the perfection of the \nuniverse, which consists of the diversity of things, would thus be a \nthing of chance, which is impossible.\nHence we must say that the distinction and multitude of things come from \nthe intention of the first agent, who is God. For He brought things into \nbeing in order that His goodness might be  communicated to creatures, and \nbe represented by them; and because His goodness could not be adequately \nrepresented by one creature alone, He produced many and diverse \ncreatures, that what was wanting to one in the representation of the \ndivine goodness might be supplied by another. For goodness, which in God \nis simple and uniform, in creatures is manifold and divided and hence the \nwhole universe together participates the divine goodness more perfectly, \nand represents it better than any single creature whatever.\nAnd because the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction of things, \ntherefore Moses said that things are made distinct by the word of God, \nwhich is the concept of His wisdom; and this is what we read in Gn. \n1:3,4: \"God said: Be light made . . .

        "ANS": "When Origen wished to refute those who said that the \ndistinction of things arose from the contrary principles of good and \nevil, he said that in the beginning all things were created equal by God. \nFor he asserted that God first created only the rational creatures and \nall equal; and that inequality arose in them from free-will, some being \nturned to God more and some less, and others turned more and others less \naway from God. And so those rational creatures which were turned to God \nby free-will, were promoted to the order of angels according to the \ndiversity of merits. And those who were turned away from God were bound \ndown to bodies according to the diversity of their sin; and he said this \nwas the cause of the creation and diversity of bodies. But according to \nthis opinion, it would follow that the universality of bodily creatures \nwould not be the effect of the goodness of God as communicated to \ncreatures, but it would be for the sake of the punishment of sin, which \nis contrary to what is said: \"God saw all the things that He had made, \nand they were very good\" (Gn. 1:31). And, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei \nii, 3): \"What can be more foolish than to say that the divine Architect \nprovided this one sun for the one world, not to be an ornament to its \nbeauty, nor for the benefit of corporeal things, but that it happened \nthrough the sin of one soul; so that, if a hundred souls had sinned, \nthere would be a hundred suns in the world?\"\nTherefore it must be said that as the wisdom of God is the cause of the \ndistinction of things, so the same wisdom is the cause of their \ninequality. This may be explained as follows. A twofold distinction is \nfound in things; one is a formal distinction as regards things differing \nspecifically; the other is a material distinction as regards things \ndiffering numerically only. And as the matter is on account of the form, \nmaterial distinction exists for the sake of the formal distinction. Hence \nwe see that in incorruptible things there is only one individual of each \nspecies, forasmuch as the species is sufficiently preserved in the one; \nwhereas in things generated and corruptible there are many individuals of \none species for the preservation of the species. Whence it appears that \nformal distinction is of greater consequence than material. Now, formal \ndistinction always requires inequality, because as the Philosopher says \n(Metaph. viii, 10), the forms of things are like numbers in which species \nvary by addition or subtraction of unity. Hence in natural things species \nseem to be arranged in degrees; as the mixed things are more perfect than \nthe elements, and plants than minerals, and animals than plants, and men \nthan other animals; and in each of these one species is more perfect than \nothers. Therefore, as the divine wisdom is the cause of the distinction \nof things for the sake of the perfection of the universe, so it is the \ncause of inequality. For the universe would  not be perfect if only one \ngrade of goodness were found in things.",

Thus, therefore, God also \nmade the universe to be best as a whole, according to the mode of a \ncreature; whereas He did not make each single creature best, but one \nbetter than another. And therefore we find it said of each creature, \"God \nsaw the light that it was good\" (Gn. 1:4); and in like manner of each one \nof the rest. But of all together it is said, \"God saw all the things that \nHe had made, and they were very good\" (Gn. 1:31).",

This appears also in works done by art; for the \nroof of a house differs from the foundation, not because it is made of \nother material; but in order that the house may be made perfect of \ndifferent parts, the artificer seeks different material; indeed, he would \nmake such material if he could."

But this explanation does not avail here. For when in a \ndivision we keep the same proportion, we continue to subtract less and \nless; for half of half is less than half of the whole.

Therefore evil also is twofold. \nIn one way it occurs by the subtraction of the form, or of any part \nrequired for the integrity of the thing, as blindness is an evil, as also \nit is an evil to be wanting in any member of the body. In another way \nevil exists by the withdrawal of the due operation, either because it \ndoes not exist, or because it has not its due mode and order. But because \ngood in itself is the object of the will, evil, which is the privation of \ngood, is found in a special way in rational creatures which have a will. \nTherefore the evil which comes from the withdrawal of the form and \nintegrity of the thing, has the nature of a pain; and especially so on \nthe supposition that all things are subject to divine providence and \njustice, as was shown above (Question [22], Article [2]); for it is of the very nature \nof a pain to be against the will. But the evil which consists in the \nsubtraction of the due operation in voluntary things has the nature of a \nfault; for this is imputed to anyone as a fault to fail as regards \nperfect action, of which he is master by the will. Therefore every evil \nin voluntary things is to be looked upon as a pain or a fault.",

The first is that one becomes evil \nby the evil of fault, but not by the evil of pain, as Dionysius says \n(Div. Nom. iv): \"To be punished is not an evil; but it is an evil to be \nmade worthy of punishment.\" And this because, since good absolutely \nconsidered consists in act, and not in potentiality, and the ultimate act \nis operation, or the use of something possessed, it follows that the \nabsolute good of man consists in good operation, or the good use of \nsomething possessed. Now we use all things by the act of the will. Hence \nfrom a good will, which makes a man use well what he has, man is called \ngood, and from a bad will he is called bad. For a man who has a bad will \ncan use ill even the good he has, as when a grammarian of his own will \nspeaks incorrectly. Therefore, because the fault itself consists in the \ndisordered act of the will, and the pain consists in the privation of \nsomething used by the will, fault has more of evil in it than pain has.\nThe second reason can be taken from the fact that God is the author of \nthe evil of pain, but not of the evil of fault. And this is because the \nevil of pain takes away the creature's good, which may be either \nsomething created, as sight, destroyed by blindness, or something \nuncreated, as by being deprived of the vision of God, the creature \nforfeits its uncreated good. But the evil of fault is properly opposed to \nuncreated good; for it is opposed to the fulfilment of the divine will, \nand to divine love, whereby the divine good is loved for itself, and not \nonly as shared by the creature. Therefore it is plain that fault has more \nevil in it than pain has.",
        "RP1": "Although fault results in pain, as merit in reward, yet \nfault is not intended on account of the pain, as merit is for the reward; \nbut rather, on the contrary, pain is brought about so that the fault may \nbe avoided, and thus fault is worse than pain.",
        "RP2": "The order of action which is destroyed by fault is the more \nperfect good of the agent, since it is the second perfection, than the \ngood taken away by pain, which is the first perfection.",

        "CON": "Augustine says (Contra Julian. i, 9): \"There is no \npossible source of evil except good.\"",
        "ANS": "It must be said that every evil in some way has a cause. \nFor evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing. \nBut that anything fail from its natural and due disposition can come only \nfrom some cause drawing it out of its  proper disposition. For a heavy \nthing is not moved upwards except by some impelling force; nor does an \nagent fail in its action except from some impediment. But only good can \nbe a cause; because nothing can be a cause except inasmuch as it is a \nbeing, and every being, as such, is good.\nAnd if we consider the special kinds of causes, we see that the agent, \nthe form, and the end, import some kind of perfection which belongs to \nthe notion of good. Even matter, as a potentiality to good, has the \nnature of good. Now that good is the cause of evil by way of the material \ncause was shown above (Question [48], Article [3]). For it was shown that good is the \nsubject of evil. But evil has no formal cause, rather is it a privation \nof form; likewise, neither has it a final cause, but rather is it a \nprivation of order to the proper end; since not only the end has the \nnature of good, but also the useful, which is ordered to the end. Evil, \nhowever, has a cause by way of an agent, not directly, but accidentally.\nIn proof of this, we must know that evil is caused in the action \notherwise than in the effect. In the action evil is caused by reason of \nthe defect of some principle of action, either of the principal or the \ninstrumental agent; thus the defect in the movement of an animal may \nhappen by reason of the weakness of the motive power, as in the case of \nchildren, or by reason only of the ineptitude of the instrument, as in \nthe lame. On the other hand, evil is caused in a thing, but not in the \nproper effect of the agent, sometimes by the power of the agent, \nsometimes by reason of a defect, either of the agent or of the matter. It \nis caused by reason of the power or perfection of the agent when there \nnecessarily follows on the form intended by the agent the privation of \nanother form; as, for instance, when on the form of fire there follows \nthe privation of the form of air or of water. Therefore, as the more \nperfect the fire is in strength, so much the more perfectly does it \nimpress its own form, so also the more perfectly does it corrupt the \ncontrary. Hence that evil and corruption befall air and water comes from \nthe perfection of the fire: but this is accidental; because fire does not \naim at the privation of the form of water, but at the bringing in of its \nown form, though by doing this it also accidentally causes the other. But \nif there is a defect in the proper effect of the fire---as, for instance, \nthat it fails to heat---this comes either by defect of the action, which \nimplies the defect of some principle, as was said above, or by the \nindisposition of the matter, which does not receive the action of the \nfire, the agent. But this very fact that it is a deficient being is \naccidental to good to which of itself it belongs to act. Hence it is true \nthat evil in no way has any but an accidental cause; and thus is good the \ncause of evil.",
        "RP1": "As Augustine says (Contra Julian. i): \"The Lord calls an \nevil will the evil tree, and a good will a good tree.\" Now, a good will \ndoes not produce a morally bad act, since it is from the good will itself \nthat a moral act is judged to be good. Nevertheless the movement itself \nof an evil will is caused by the rational creature, which is good; and \nthus good is the cause of  evil.",
        "RP2": "Good does not cause that evil which is contrary to itself, \nbut some other evil: thus the goodness of the fire causes evil to the \nwater, and man, good as to his nature, causes an act morally evil. And, \nas explained above (Question [19], Article [9]), this is by accident. Moreover, it does \nhappen sometimes that one contrary causes another by accident: for \ninstance, the exterior surrounding cold heats (the body) through the \nconcentration of the inward heat.",
        "RP3": "Evil has a deficient cause in voluntary things otherwise \nthan in natural things. For the natural agent produces the same kind of \neffect as it is itself, unless it is impeded by some exterior thing; and \nthis amounts to some defect belonging to it. Hence evil never follows in \nthe effect, unless some other evil pre-exists in the agent or in the \nmatter, as was said above. But in voluntary things the defect of the \naction comes from the will actually deficient, inasmuch as it does not \nactually subject itself to its proper rule.

For he supposes that whatever things are distinguished by \nthe intellect are really distinct. Now as regards incorporeal substance, \nthe intellect apprehends that which distinguishes it from corporeal \nsubstance, and that which it has in common with it. Hence he concludes \nthat what distinguishes incorporeal from corporeal substance is a kind of \nform to it, and whatever is subject to this distinguishing form, as it \nwere something common, is its matter. Therefore, he asserts the universal \nmatter of spiritual and corporeal things is the same; so that it must be \nunderstood that the form of incorporeal substance is impressed in the \nmatter of spiritual things, in the same way as the form of quantity is \nimpressed in the matter of corporeal things.\nBut one glance is enough to show that there cannot be one matter of \nspiritual and of corporeal things. For it is not possible  that a \nspiritual and a corporeal form should be received into the same part of \nmatter, otherwise one and the same thing would be corporeal and \nspiritual. Hence it would follow that one part of matter receives the \ncorporeal form, and another receives the spiritual form. Matter, however, \nis not divisible into parts except as regarded under quantity; and \nwithout quantity substance is indivisible, as Aristotle says (Phys. i, \ntext 15). Therefore it would follow that the matter of spiritual things \nis subject to quantity; which cannot be. Therefore it is impossible that \ncorporeal and spiritual things should have the same matter.\nIt is, further, impossible for an intellectual substance to have any \nkind of matter. For the operation belonging to anything is according to \nthe mode of its substance. Now to understand is an altogether immaterial \noperation, as appears from its object, whence any act receives its \nspecies and nature. For a thing is understood according to its degree of \nimmateriality; because forms that exist in matter are individual forms \nwhich the intellect cannot apprehend as such. Hence it must be that every \nindividual substance is altogether immaterial.\nBut things distinguished by the intellect are not necessarily \ndistinguished in reality; because the intellect does not apprehend things \naccording to their mode, but according to its own mode. Hence material \nthings which are below our intellect exist in our intellect in a simpler \nmode than they exist in themselves. Angelic substances, on the other \nhand, are above our intellect; and hence our intellect cannot attain to \napprehend them, as they are in themselves, but by its own mode, according \nas it apprehends composite things; and in this way also it apprehends God \n(Question [3]).",

But in material things there is \none thing which determines to a special grade, and that is the form; and \nanother thing which is determined, and this is the matter; and hence from \nthe latter the \"genus\" is derived, and from the former the \"difference.\" \nWhereas in immaterial things there is no separate determinator and thing \ndetermined; each thing by its own self holds a determinate grade in \nbeing; and therefore in them \"genus\" and \"difference\" are not derived \nfrom different things, but from one and the same.

Such a composite nature is not its own existence but \nexistence is its act. Hence the nature itself is related to its own \nexistence as potentiality to act. Therefore if there be no matter, and \nsupposing that the form itself subsists without matter, there \nnevertheless still remains the relation of the form to its very \nexistence, as of potentiality to act.

For \"what is,\" is the form itself subsisting; and \nthe existence itself is whereby the substance is; as the running is \nwhereby the runner runs.

But immaterial created substances are finite in their being; \nwhereas they are infinite in the sense that their forms are not received \nin anything else; as if we were to say, for example, that whiteness \nexisting separate is infinite as regards the nature of whiteness, \nforasmuch as it is not contracted to any one subject; while its \"being\" \nis finite as determined to some one special nature.\nWhence it is said (De Causis, prop. 16) that \"intelligence is finite \nfrom above,\" as receiving its being from above itself, and is \"infinite \nfrom below,\" as not received in any matter."

Plato contended that the separate \nsubstances are the species of sensible things; as if we were to maintain \nthat human nature is a separate substance of itself: and according to \nthis view it would have to be maintained that the number of the separate \nsubstances is the number of the species of sensible things. Aristotle, \nhowever, rejects this view (Metaph. i, text 31) because matter is of the \nvery nature of the species of sensible things. Consequently the separate \nsubstances cannot be the exemplar species of these sensible things; but \nhave their own fixed natures, which are higher than the natures of \nsensible things. Nevertheless Aristotle held (Metaph. xi, text 43) that \nthose more perfect natures bear relation to these sensible things, as \nthat of mover and end; and therefore he strove to find out the number of \nthe separate substances according to the number of the first movements.\nBut since this appears to militate against the teachings of Sacred \nScripture, Rabbi Moses the Jew, wishing to bring both into harmony, held \nthat the angels, in so far as they are styled immaterial substances, are \nmultiplied according to the number of heavenly movements or bodies, as \nAristotle held (Metaph. xi, text 43); while he contended that in the \nScriptures even men bearing a divine message are styled angels; and \nagain, even the powers of natural things, which manifest God's almighty \npower. It is, however, quite foreign to the custom of the Scriptures for \nthe powers of irrational things to be designated as angels.\nHence it must be said that the angels, even inasmuch as they are \nimmaterial substances, exist in exceeding great number, far beyond all \nmaterial multitude. This is what Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xiv): \"There \nare many blessed armies of the heavenly intelligences, surpassing the \nweak and limited reckoning of our material numbers.\" The reason whereof \nis this, because, since it is the perfection of the universe that God \nchiefly intends in the creation of things, the more perfect some things \nare, in so much greater an excess are they created by God. Now, as in \nbodies such excess is observed in regard to their magnitude, so in things \nincorporeal is it observed in regard to their multitude. We see, in fact, \nthat incorruptible bodies, exceed corruptible bodies almost incomparably \nin magnitude; for the entire sphere of things active and passive is \nsomething very small in comparison with the heavenly bodies. Hence it is \nreasonable to conclude that the immaterial substances as it were \nincomparably exceed material substances as to multitude.",

But it is not true that the immaterial substances exist on \naccount of the corporeal, because the end is nobler than the means to the \nend.

The reason for this is, that nothing \nis corrupted except by its form being separated from the matter. Hence, \nsince an angel is a subsisting form, as is clear from what was said above \n(Article [2]), it is impossible for its substance to be corruptible. For what \nbelongs to anything considered in itself can never be separated from it; \nbut what belongs to a thing, considered in relation to something else, \ncan be separated, when that something else is taken away, in view of \nwhich it belonged to it. Roundness can never be taken from the circle, \nbecause it belongs to it of itself; but a bronze circle can  lose \nroundness, if the bronze be deprived of its circular shape. Now to be \nbelongs to a form considered in itself; for everything is an actual being \naccording to its form: whereas matter is an actual being by the form. \nConsequently a subject composed of matter and form ceases to be actually \nwhen the form is separated from the matter. But if the form subsists in \nits own being, as happens in the angels, as was said above (Article [2]), it \ncannot lose its being. Therefore, the angel's immateriality is the cause \nwhy it is incorruptible by its own nature.\nA token of this incorruptibility can be gathered from its intellectual \noperation; for since everything acts according as it is actual, the \noperation of a thing indicates its mode of being.

But this has befallen \nthe angels in their assumed bodies; for it is related: \"After the sons of \nGod went in to the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, \nthese are the mighty men of old, men of renown\" (Gn. 6:4). Consequently \nthe angels exercised vital functions in their assumed bodies.\nReply to  Properly speaking, the angels cannot be said to eat, \nbecause eating involves the taking of food convertible into the substance \nof the eater.\nAlthough after the Resurrection food was not converted into the \nsubstance of Christ's body, but resolved into pre-existing matter; \nnevertheless Christ had a body of such a true nature that food could be \nchanged into it; hence it was a true eating. But the food taken by angels \nwas neither changed into the assumed body, nor was the body of such a \nnature that food could be changed into it;  consequently, it was not a \ntrue eating, but figurative of spiritual eating. This is what the angel \nsaid to Tobias: \"When I was with you, I seemed indeed to eat and to \ndrink; but I use an invisible meat and drink\" (Tob. 12:19).\nAbraham offered them food, deeming them to be men, in whom, \nnevertheless, he worshipped God, as God is wont to be in the prophets, as \nAugustine says (De Civ.

Dei xv): \"Many persons affirm \nthat they have had the experience, or have heard from such as have \nexperienced it, that the Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk call \nincubi, have often presented themselves before women, and have sought and \nprocured intercourse with them. Hence it is folly to deny it. But God's \nholy angels could not fall in such fashion before the deluge. Hence by \nthe sons of God are to be understood the sons of Seth, who were good; \nwhile by the daughters of men the Scripture designates those who sprang \nfrom the race of Cain. Nor is it to be wondered at that giants should be \nborn of them; for they were not all giants, albeit there were many more \nbefore than after the deluge.\" Still if some are occasionally begotten \nfrom demons, it is not from the seed of such demons, nor from their \nassumed bodies, but from the seed of men taken for the purpose; as when \nthe demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; \njust as they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes, \nas Augustine says (De Trin. iii), so that the person born is not the \nchild of a demon, but of a man.",

Now since the \nangel's power is finite, it does not extend to all things, but to one \ndetermined thing. For whatever is compared with one power must be \ncompared therewith as one determined thing. Consequently since all being \nis compared as one thing to God's universal power, so is one particular \nbeing compared as one with the angelic power. Hence, since the angel is \nin a place by the application of his power to the place, it follows that \nhe is not everywhere, nor in several places, but in only one place.\nSome, however, have been deceived in this matter. For some who were \nunable to go beyond the reach of their imaginations supposed the \nindivisibility of the angel to be like that of a point; consequently they \nthought that an angel could be only in a place which is a point. But they \nwere manifestly deceived, because a point is something indivisible, yet \nhaving its situation; whereas the angel is indivisible, and beyond the \ngenus of quantity and situation. Consequently there is no occasion for \ndetermining in his regard one indivisible place as to situation: any \nplace which is either divisible or indivisible, great or small suffices, \naccording as to his own free-will he applies his power to a great or to a \nsmall body. So the entire body to which he is applied by his power, \ncorresponds as one place to him.\nNeither, if any angel moves the heavens, is it necessary for him to be \neverywhere. First of all, because his power is applied only to what is \nfirst moved by him. Now there is one part of the heavens in which there \nis movement first of all, namely, the part to the east: hence the \nPhilosopher (Phys. vii, text 84) attributes the power of the heavenly \nmover to the part which is in the east. Secondly, because philosophers do \nnot hold that one separate substance moves all the spheres immediately. \nHence it need not be everywhere.\nSo, then, it is evident that to be in a place appertains quite \ndifferently to a body, to an angel, and to God. For a body is in a place \nin a circumscribed fashion, since it is measured by the place. An angel, \nhowever, is not there in a circumscribed fashion, since he is not \nmeasured by the place, but definitively, because he is in a place in such \na manner that he is not in another. But God is neither circumscriptively \nnor definitively there, because He is everywhere.\nFrom this we can easily gather an answer to the objections: because the \nentire subject to which the angelic power is immediately applied, is \nreputed as one place, even though it be continuous."

        "ANS": "A beatified angel can be moved locally. As, however, to \nbe in a place belongs equivocally to a body and to an angel, so likewise \ndoes local movement. For a body is in a place in so far as it is \ncontained under the place, and is commensurate with the place. Hence it \nis necessary for local movement of a body to be commensurate with the \nplace, and according to its exigency. Hence it is that the continuity of \nmovement is according to the continuity of magnitude; and according to \npriority and posteriority of local movement, as the Philosopher says \n(Phys. iv, text 99). But an angel is not in a place as commensurate and \ncontained, but rather as containing it. Hence it is not necessary for the \nlocal movement of an angel to be commensurate with the place, nor for it \nto be according to the exigency of the place, so as to have continuity \ntherefrom; but it is a non-continuous movement. For since the angel is in \na place only by virtual contact, as was said above (Question [52], Article [1]), it \nfollows necessarily that the movement of an angel in a place is nothing \nelse than the various contacts of various places successively, and not at \nonce; because an angel cannot be in several places at one time, as was \nsaid above (Question [52], Article [2]). Nor is it necessary for these contacts to be \ncontinuous. Nevertheless a certain kind of continuity can be found in \nsuch  contacts. Because, as was said above (Question [52], Article [1]), there is \nnothing to hinder us from assigning a divisible place to an angel \naccording to virtual contact; just as a divisible place is assigned to a \nbody by contact of magnitude. Hence as a body successively, and not all \nat once, quits the place in which it was before, and thence arises \ncontinuity in its local movement; so likewise an angel can successively \nquit the divisible place in which he was before, and so his movement will \nbe continuous. And he can all at once quit the whole place, and in the \nsame instant apply himself to the whole of another place, and thus his \nmovement will not be continuous.",

And this cannot be said of an angel.\nSecondly, because Aristotle's demonstration deals with movement which is \ncontinuous. For if the movement were not continuous, it might be said \nthat a thing is moved where it is in the term \"wherefrom,\" and while it \nis in the term \"whereto\": because the very succession of \"wheres,\" \nregarding the same thing, would be called movement: hence, in whichever \nof those \"wheres\" the thing might be, it could be said to be moved. But \nthe continuity of movement prevents this; because nothing which is \ncontinuous is in its term, as is clear, because the line is not in the \npoint. Therefore it is necessary for the thing moved to be not totally in \neither of the terms while it is being moved; but partly in the one, and \npartly in the other. Therefore, according as the angel's movement is not \ncontinuous, Aristotle's demonstration does not hold good. But according \nas the angel's movement is held to be continuous, it can be so granted, \nthat, while an angel is in movement, he is partly in the term \n\"wherefrom,\" and partly in the term \"whereto\" (yet so that such \npartiality be not referred to the angel's substance, but to the place); \nbecause at the outset of his continuous movement the angel is in the \nwhole divisible place from which he begins to be moved; but while he is \nactually in movement, he is in part of the first place which he quits, \nand in part of the second place which he occupies. This very fact that he \ncan occupy the parts of two places appertains to the angel from this, \nthat he can occupy a divisible place by applying his power; as a body \ndoes by application of magnitude.

If it be \ncontinuous, the angel cannot pass from one extreme to another without \npassing through the mid-space; because, as is said by the Philosopher \n(Phys. v, text 22; vi, text 77), \"The middle is that into which a thing \nwhich is continually moved comes, before arriving at the last into which \nit is moved\"; because the order of first and last in continuous movement, \nis according to the order of the first and last in magnitude, as he says \n(Phys. iv, text 99).\nBut if an angel's movement be not continuous, it is possible for him to \npass from one extreme to another without going through the middle: which \nis evident thus. Between the two extreme limits there are infinite \nintermediate places; whether the places be taken as divisible or as \nindivisible. This is clearly evident with regard to places which are \nindivisible; because between every two points that are infinite \nintermediate points, since no two points follow one another without a \nmiddle, as is proved in Phys. vi, text. 1. And the same must of necessity \nbe said of divisible places: and this is shown from the continuous \nmovement of a body. For a body is not moved from place to place except in \ntime. But in the whole time which measures the movement of a body, there \nare not two \"nows\" in which the body moved is not in one place and in \nanother; for if it were in one and the same place in two \"nows,\" it would \nfollow that  it would be at rest there; since to be at rest is nothing \nelse than to be in the same place now and previously. Therefore since \nthere are infinite \"nows\" between the first and the last \"now\" of the \ntime which measures the movement, there must be infinite places between \nthe first from which the movement begins, and the last where the movement \nceases. This again is made evident from sensible experience. Let there be \na body of a palm's length, and let there be a plane measuring two palms, \nalong which it travels; it is evident that the first place from which the \nmovement starts is that of the one palm; and the place wherein the \nmovement ends is that of the other palm. Now it is clear that when it \nbegins to move, it gradually quits the first palm and enters the second. \nAccording, then, as the magnitude of the palm is divided, even so are the \nintermediate places multiplied; because every distinct point in the \nmagnitude of the first palm is the beginning of a place, and a distinct \npoint in the magnitude of the other palm is the limit of the same. \nAccordingly, since magnitude is infinitely divisible and the points in \nevery magnitude are likewise infinite in potentiality, it follows that \nbetween every two places there are infinite intermediate places.\nNow a movable body only exhausts the infinity of the intermediate places \nby the continuity of its movement; because, as the intermediate places \nare infinite in potentiality, so likewise must there be reckoned some \ninfinitudes in movement which is continuous. Consequently, if the \nmovement be not continuous, then all the parts of the movement will be \nactually numbered. If, therefore, any movable body be moved, but not by \ncontinuous movement, it follows, either that it does not pass through all \nthe intermediate places, or else that it actually numbers infinite \nplaces: which is not possible. Accordingly, then, as the angel's movement \nis not continuous, he does not pass through all intermediate places.\nNow, the actual passing from one extreme to the other, without going \nthrough the mid-space, is quite in keeping with an angel's nature; but \nnot with that of a body, because a body is measured by and contained \nunder a place; hence it is bound to follow the laws of place in its \nmovement.

They said that when an angel is moved from place to \nplace, during the whole of the preceding time he is in the term \n\"wherefrom\"; but in the last instant of such time he is in the term \n\"whereto.\" Nor is there any need for a medium between the terms, just as \nthere is no medium between time and the limit of time. But there is a \nmid-time between two \"nows\" of time: hence they say that a last \"now\" \ncannot be assigned in which it was in the term \"wherefrom,\" just as in \nillumination, and in the substantial generation of fire, there is no last \ninstant to be assigned in which the air was dark, or in which the matter \nwas  under the privation of the form of fire: but a last time can be \nassigned, so that in the last instant of such time there is light in the \nair, or the form of fire in the matter. And so illumination and \nsubstantial generation are called instantaneous movements.\nBut this does not hold good in the present case; and it is shown thus. \nIt is of the nature of rest that the subject in repose be not otherwise \ndisposed now than it was before: and therefore in every \"now\" of time \nwhich measures rest, the subject reposing is in the same \"where\" in the \nfirst, in the middle, and in the last \"now.\" On the other hand, it is of \nthe very nature of movement for the subject moved to be otherwise now \nthan it was before: and therefore in every \"now\" of time which measures \nmovement, the movable subject is in various dispositions; hence in the \nlast \"now\" it must have a different form from what it had before. So it \nis evident that to rest during the whole time in some (disposition), for \ninstance, in whiteness, is to be in it in every instant of such time. \nHence it is not possible for anything to rest in one term during the \nwhole of the preceding time, and afterwards in the last instant of that \ntime to be in the other term. But this is possible in movement: because \nto be moved in any whole time, is not to be in the same disposition in \nevery instant of that time. Therefore all instantaneous changes of the \nkind are terms of a continuous movement: just as generation is the term \nof the alteration of matter, and illumination is the term of the local \nmovement of the illuminating body. Now the local movement of an angel is \nnot the term of any other continuous movement, but is of itself, \ndepending upon no other movement. Consequently it is impossible to say \nthat he is in any place during the whole time, and that in the last \"now\" \nhe is in another place: but some \"now\" must be assigned in which he was \nlast in the preceding place. But where there are many \"nows\" succeeding \none another, there is necessarily time; since time is nothing else than \nthe reckoning of before and after in movement. It remains, then, that the \nmovement of an angel is in time. It is in continuous time if his movement \nbe continuous, and in non-continuous time if his movement is \nnon-continuous for, as was said (Article [1]), his movement can be of either \nkind, since the continuity of time comes of the continuity of movement, \nas the Philosopher says (Phys. iv, text 99).\nBut that time, whether it be continuous or not, is not the same as the \ntime which measures the movement of the heavens, and whereby all \ncorporeal things are measured, which have their changeableness from the \nmovement of the heavens; because the angel's movement does not depend \nupon the movement of the heavens.",

If, however, it be continuous, it is \nindeed proportionable, not, indeed, because of the proportion of the \nmover and the movable, but on account of the proportion of the magnitudes \nin which the movement exists. Besides, the swiftness of the angel's \nmovement is  not measured by the quantity of his power, but according to \nthe determination of his will.",
        "RP2": "Illumination is the term of a movement; and is an \nalteration, not a local movement, as though the light were understood to \nbe moved to what is near, before being moved to what is remote. But the \nangel's movement is local, and, besides, it is not the term of movement; \nhence there is no comparison.",
        "RP3": "This objection is based on continuous time. But the same \ntime of an angel's movement can be non-continuous. So an angel can be in \none place in one instant, and in another place in the next instant, \nwithout any time intervening. If the time of the angel's movement be \ncontinuous, he is changed through infinite places throughout the whole \ntime which precedes the last 'now'; as was already shown (Article [2]). \nNevertheless he is partly in one of the continuous places, and partly in \nanother, not because his substance is susceptible of parts, but because \nhis power is applied to a part of the first place and to a part of the \nsecond, as was said above (Article [2])."

This is the power which is \ndenominated the passive intellect. The necessity for admitting an active \nintellect is due to this---that the natures of the material things which \nwe understand do not exist outside the soul, as immaterial and actually \nintelligible, but are only intelligible in potentiality so long as they \nare outside the soul.

First, it \nmay be replied that those authorities are speaking according to the \nopinion of such men as contended that angels and demons have bodies \nnaturally united to them.

Because, since sense has a sure apprehension of its \nproper sensible object, it is a common usage of speech, when he \nunderstands something for certain, to say that we \"sense it.\" And hence \nit is that we use the word \"sentence.\" Experience can be attributed to \nthe angels according to the likeness of the things known, although not by \nlikeness of the faculty knowing them.

But \nmemory can be allowed in the angels, according as Augustine (De Trin. x) \nputs it in the mind; although it cannot belong to them in so far as it is \na part of the sensitive soul. In like fashion 'a perverted phantasy' is \nattributed to demons, since they have a false practical estimate of what \nis the true good; while deception in us comes properly from the phantasy, \nwhereby we sometimes hold fast to images of things as to the things \nthemselves, as is manifest in sleepers and lunatics."

On the other hand, the higher \nsubstances---that is, the angels---are utterly free from bodies, and \nsubsist immaterially and in their own intelligible nature; consequently \nthey attain their intelligible perfection through an intelligible \noutpouring, whereby they received from God the species of things known, \ntogether with their intellectual nature. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad \nlit. ii, 8): \"The other things which are lower than the angels are so \ncreated that they first receive existence in the knowledge of the \nrational creature, and then in their own nature.\"",
        "RP1": "There are images of creatures in the angel's mind, not, \nindeed derived from creatures, but from God, Who is the cause of \ncreatures, and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first exist. Hence \nAugustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that, \"As the type, according to \nwhich the creature is fashioned, is in the Word of God before the \ncreature which is fashioned, so the knowledge of the same type exists \nfirst in the intellectual creature, and is afterwards the very fashioning \nof the creature.\"",
        "RP2": "To go from one extreme to the other it is  necessary to \npass through the middle. Now the nature of a form in the imagination, \nwhich form is without matter but not without material conditions, stands \nmidway between the nature of a form which is in matter, and the nature of \na form which is in the intellect by abstraction from matter and from \nmaterial conditions. Consequently, however powerful the angelic mind \nmight be, it could not reduce material forms to an intelligible \ncondition, except it were first to reduce them to the nature of imagined \nforms; which is impossible, since the angel has no imagination, as was \nsaid above (Question [54], Article [5]). Even granted that he could abstract \nintelligible species from material things, yet he would not do so; \nbecause he would not need them, for he has connatural intelligible \nspecies.",

This plenitude of knowledge is found in created intellects in a \nlower manner, and less simply.  Consequently it is necessary for the \nlower intelligences to know by many forms what God knows by one, and by \nso many forms the more according as the intellect is lower.\nThus the higher the angel is, by so much the fewer species will he be \nable to apprehend the whole mass of intelligible objects.

To know a thing thus is something less \nperfect: for he would have but an imperfect knowledge of a man who only \nknew him to be an animal. In another way, on the part of the medium of \nsuch knowledge.

And the \nobject which is united to a faculty bears the same relation to actions of \nthis kind as does the form which is the principle of action in other \nagents: for, as heat is the formal principle of heating in the fire, so \nis the species of the thing seen the formal principle of sight to the eye.\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that this image of the object exists \nsometimes only potentially in the knowing faculty; and then there is only \nknowledge in potentiality; and in order that there may be actual \nknowledge, it is required that the faculty of knowledge be actuated by \nthe species. But if it always actually possesses the species, it can \nthereby have actual knowledge without any preceding change or reception. \nFrom this it is evident that it is not of the nature of knower, as \nknowing, to be moved by the object, but as knowing in potentiality.

So therefore, if in the order of \nintelligible beings there be any subsisting intelligible form, it will \nunderstand itself.

In the first place this derogates from the Catholic faith, \nwhich asserts that these lower things are administered by angels, \naccording to Heb. 1:14: \"They are all ministering spirits.\"  Now, if they \nhad no knowledge of singulars, they could exercise no provision over what \nis going on in this world; since acts belong to individuals: and this is \nagainst the text of Eccles. 5:5: \"Say not before the angel: There is no \nprovidence.\" Secondly, it is also contrary to the teachings of \nphilosophy, according to which the angels are stated to be the movers of \nthe heavenly spheres, and to move them according to their knowledge and \nwill.\nConsequently others have said that the angel possesses knowledge of \nsingulars, but in their universal causes, to which all particular effects \nare reduced; as if the astronomer were to foretell a coming eclipse from \nthe dispositions of the movements of the heavens. This opinion does not \nescape the aforesaid implications; because, to know a singular, merely in \nits universal causes, is not to know it as singular, that is, as it \nexists here and now. The astronomer, knowing from computation of the \nheavenly movements that an eclipse is about to happen, knows it in the \nuniversal; yet he does not know it as taking place now, except by the \nsenses. But administration, providence and movement are of singulars, as \nthey are here and now existing.\nTherefore, it must be said differently, that, as man by his various \npowers of knowledge knows all classes of things, apprehending universals \nand immaterial things by his intellect, and things singular and corporeal \nby the senses, so an angel knows both by his one mental power. For the \norder of things runs in this way, that the higher a thing is, so much the \nmore is its power united and far-reaching: thus in man himself it is \nmanifest that the common sense which is higher than the proper sense, \nalthough it is but one faculty, knows everything apprehended by the five \noutward senses, and some other things which no outer sense knows; for \nexample, the difference between white and sweet.

Hence Aristotle pronounces it \nridiculous to say that a discord, which is known to us, should be unknown \nto God (De Anima i, text. 80; Metaph. text. 15).\nThe manner in which an angel knows singular things can be considered \nfrom this, that, as things proceed from God in order that they may \nsubsist in their own natures, so likewise they proceed in order that they \nmay exist in the angelic mind. Now it is clear that there comes forth \nfrom God not only whatever belongs to their universal nature, but \nlikewise all that goes to make up their principles of individuation; \nsince He is the cause of the entire substance of the thing, as to both \nits matter and its form. And for as much as He causes, does He know; for \nHis knowledge is the cause of a thing, as was shown above (Question [14], Article [8]). \nTherefore as by His essence, by which He causes all things, God is the \nlikeness of all things, and knows all things, not only as to their \nuniversal natures, but also as to their singularity; so through the \nspecies imparted to them do the angels know things, not only as to their  \nuniversal nature, but likewise in their individual conditions, in so far \nas they are the manifold representations of that one simple essence.",

Much more then can angels, or \neven demons, the more deeply they penetrate those occult bodily \nmodifications.

Yet the angels do \nnot necessarily know the movement of the sensitive appetite and the \nimaginative apprehension of man in so far as these are moved by the will \nand reason; because, even the lower part of the soul has some share of \nreason, as obeying its ruler, as is said in Ethics iii, 12. But it does \nnot follow that, if the angel knows what is passing through man's \nsensitive appetite or imagination, he knows what is in the thought or \nwill: because the intellect or will is not subject to the sensitive \nappetite or the imagination, but can make various uses of them."

For it has been said (Article [4]) that an angel understands not by \ncomposing and dividing, but by understanding what a thing is. Now the \nintellect is always true as regards what a thing is, just as the sense \nregarding its proper object, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 26. But by \naccident, deception and falsehood creep in, when we understand the \nessence of a thing by some kind of composition, and this happens either \nwhen we take the definition of one thing for another, or when the parts \nof a definition do not hang together, as if we were to accept as the \ndefinition of some creature, \"a four-footed flying beast,\" for there is \nno such animal. And this comes about in things composite, the definition \nof which is drawn from diverse elements, one of which is as matter to the \nother. But there is no room for error in understanding simple quiddities, \nas is stated in Metaph. ix, text. 22; for either they are not grasped at \nall, and so we know nothing respecting them; or else they are known \nprecisely as they exist.\nSo therefore, no falsehood, error, or deception can exist of itself in \nthe mind of any angel; yet it does so happen accidentally; but very \ndifferently from the way it befalls us. For we sometimes get at the \nquiddity of a thing by a composing and  dividing process, as when, by \ndivision and demonstration, we seek out the truth of a definition. Such \nis not the method of the angels; but through the (knowledge of the) \nessence of a thing they know everything that can be said regarding it. \nNow it is quite evident that the quiddity of a thing can be a source of \nknowledge with regard to everything belonging to such thing, or excluded \nfrom it; but not of what may be dependent on God's supernatural \nordinance. Consequently, owing to their upright will, from their knowing \nthe nature of every creature, the good angels form no judgments as to the \nnature of the qualities therein, save under the Divine ordinance; hence \nthere can be no error or falsehood in them. But since the minds of demons \nare utterly perverted from the Divine wisdom, they at times form their \nopinions of things simply according to the natural conditions of the \nsame. Nor are they ever deceived as to the natural properties of \nanything; but they can be misled with regard to supernatural matters; for \nexample, on seeing a dead man, they may suppose that he will not rise \nagain, or, on beholding Christ, they may judge Him not to be God.\nFrom all this the answers to the objections of both sides of the \nquestion are evident. For the perversity of the demons comes of their not \nbeing subject to the Divine wisdom; while nescience is in the angels as \nregards things knowable, not naturally but supernaturally. It is, \nfurthermore, evident that their understanding of what a thing is, is \nalways true, save accidentally, according as it is, in an undue manner, \nreferred to some composition or division."

Now love follows knowledge, as has been already stated \n(Article [1]; Question [16], Article [1]). Consequently, besides their infused love, there is \nonly natural love in the angels. Therefore there is no love of choice in \nthem.",
        "CON": "We neither merit nor demerit by our natural acts. But \nby their love the angels merit or demerit. Therefore there is love of \nchoice in them.",

Their natural love is the principle of their love of choice; \nbecause, what belongs to that which precedes, has always the nature of a \nprinciple. Wherefore, since nature is first in everything, what belongs \nto nature must be a principle in everything.\nThis is clearly evident in man, with respect to both his intellect and \nhis will. For the intellect knows principles naturally; and from such \nknowledge in man comes the knowledge of conclusions, which are known by \nhim not naturally, but by  discovery, or by teaching. In like manner, the \nend acts in the will in the same way as the principle does in the \nintellect, as is laid down in Phys. ii, text. 89. Consequently the will \ntends naturally to its last end; for every man naturally wills happiness: \nand all other desires are caused by this natural desire; since whatever a \nman wills he wills on account of the end. Therefore the love of that \ngood, which a man naturally wills as an end, is his natural love; but the \nlove which comes of this, which is of something loved for the end's sake, \nis the love of choice.\nThere is however a difference on the part of the intellect and on the \npart of the will. Because, as was stated already (Question [59], Article [2]), the \nmind's knowledge is brought about by the inward presence of the known \nwithin the knower. It comes of the imperfection of man's intellectual \nnature that his mind does not simultaneously possess all things capable \nof being understood, but only a few things from which he is moved in a \nmeasure to grasp other things. The act of the appetitive faculty, on the \ncontrary, follows the inclination of man towards things; some of which \nare good in themselves, and consequently are appetible in themselves; \nothers being good only in relation to something else, and being appetible \non account of something else. Consequently it does not argue imperfection \nin the person desiring, for him to seek one thing naturally as his end, \nand something else from choice as ordained to such end. Therefore, since \nthe intellectual nature of the angels is perfect, only natural and not \ndeductive knowledge is to be found in them, but there is to be found in \nthem both natural love and love of choice.\nIn saying all this, we are passing over all that regards things which \nare above nature, since nature is not the sufficient principle thereof: \nbut we shall speak of them later on (Question [62]).",

Now there is a twofold ultimate perfection of rational or of \nintellectual nature. The first is one which it can procure of its own \nnatural power; and this is in a measure called beatitude or happiness. \nHence Aristotle (Ethic. x) says that man's ultimate happiness consists in \nhis most perfect contemplation, whereby in this life he can behold the \nbest intelligible object; and that is God. Above this happiness there is \nstill another, which we look forward to in the future, whereby \"we shall \nsee God as He is.\" This is beyond the nature of every created intellect, \nas was shown above (Question [12], Article [4]).\nSo, then, it remains to be said, that, as regards this first beatitude, \nwhich the angel could procure by his natural power, he was created \nalready blessed. Because the angel does not acquire such beatitude by any \nprogressive action, as man does, but, as was observed above (Question [58], Articles [3],4), is straightway in possession thereof, owing to his natural dignity. \nBut the angels did not have from the beginning of their creation that \nultimate beatitude which is beyond the power of nature; because such \nbeatitude is no part of their nature, but its end; and consequently they \nought not to have it immediately from the beginning.",

Now it is evident from what has \ngone before (Articles [1],2; Question [12], Articles [4],5), ultimate beatitude exceeds both \nthe angelic and the human nature. It remains, then, that both man and \nangel merited their beatitude.\nAnd if the angel was created in grace, without which there is no merit, \nthere would be no difficulty in saying that he merited beatitude: as \nalso, if one were to say that he had grace in any way before he had glory.\nBut if he had no grace before entering upon beatitude, it would then \nhave to be said that he had beatitude without merit, even as we have \ngrace.

The angel is not \na compound of different natures, so that the inclination of the one \nthwarts or retards the tendency of the other; as happens in man, in whom \nthe movement of his intellective part is either retarded or thwarted by \nthe inclination of his sensitive part.

Now it is evident, since the rational creature cannot of its \nown power attain to its beatitude, which consists in the vision of God, \nas is clear from what has gone before (Question [12], Article [4]), that it needs to be \nmoved by God towards its beatitude. Therefore there must be some one \ndetermined thing to which every rational creature is directed as to its \nlast end.\nNow this one determinate object cannot, in the vision of God, consist \nprecisely in that which is seen; for the Supreme Truth is seen by all the \nblessed in various degrees: but it is on the part of the mode of vision, \nthat diverse terms are fixed beforehand by the intention of Him Who \ndirects towards the end. For it is impossible that as the rational \ncreature is led on to the vision of the Supreme Essence, it should be led \non in the same way to the supreme mode of vision, which is comprehension, \nfor this belongs to God only; as is evident from what was said above \n(Question [12], Article [7]; Question [14], Article [3]).

And as beatitude \nconsists in vision, so the degree of vision lies in a determinate mode of \nthe vision.\nTherefore every rational creature is so led by God to the end of its \nbeatitude, that from God's predestination it is brought even to a \ndeterminate degree of beatitude.

The adulterer errs \nin the particular, choosing this delight of an inordinate act as \nsomething good to be performed now, from the inclination of passion or of \nhabit; even though he does not err in his universal judgment, but retains \na right opinion in this respect. In this way there can be no sin in the \nangel; because there are no passions in the angels to fetter reason or \nintellect, as is manifest from what has been said above (Question [59], Article [4]); \nnor, again, could any habit inclining to sin precede their first sin. In \nanother way sin comes of free-will by choosing something good in itself, \nbut not according to proper measure or rule; so that the defect which \ninduces sin is only on the part of the choice which is not properly \nregulated, but not on the part of the thing chosen; as if one were to \npray, without heeding the order established by the Church. Such a sin \ndoes not presuppose ignorance, but merely absence of consideration of the \nthings which ought to be considered.

As to guilt, all sins are in the \ndemons; since by leading men to sin they incur the guilt of all sins. But \nas to affection only those sins can be in the demons which can belong to \na spiritual nature. Now a spiritual nature cannot be affected by such \npleasures as appertain to bodies, but only by such as are in keeping with \nspiritual things; because nothing is affected except with regard to \nsomething which is in  some way suited to its nature. But there can be no \nsin when anyone is incited to good of the spiritual order; unless in such \naffection the rule of the superior be not kept. Such is precisely the sin \nof pride---not to be subject to a superior when subjection is due. \nConsequently the first sin of the angel can be none other than pride.\nYet, as a consequence, it was possible for envy also to be in them, \nsince for the appetite to tend to the desire of something involves on its \npart resistance to anything contrary.

He could not seek to be as God in the first way; because by \nnatural knowledge he knew that this was impossible: and there was no \nhabit preceding his first sinful act, nor any passion fettering his mind, \nso as to lead him to choose what was impossible by failing in some \nparticular; as sometimes happens in ourselves. And even supposing it were \npossible, it would be against the natural desire; because there exists in \neverything the natural desire of preserving its own nature; which would \nnot be preserved were it to be changed into another nature. Consequently, \nno creature of a lower order can ever covet the grade of a higher nature; \njust as an ass does not desire to be a horse: for were it to be so \nupraised, it would cease to be itself. But herein the imagination plays \nus false; for one is liable to think that, because a man seeks to occupy \na higher grade as to accidentals, which can increase without the \ndestruction of the subject, he can also seek a higher grade of nature, to \nwhich he could not attain without ceasing to exist. Now it is quite \nevident that God surpasses the angels, not merely in accidentals, but \nalso in degree of nature; and one angel, another. Consequently it is \nimpossible for one angel of lower degree to desire equality with a \nhigher; and still more to covet equality with God.\nTo desire to be as God according to likeness can happen in two ways. In \none way, as to that likeness whereby everything is made to be likened \nunto God. And so, if anyone desire in this way to be Godlike, he commits \nno sin; provided that he desires such likeness in proper order, that is \nto say, that he may obtain it of God. But he would sin were he to desire \nto be like unto God even in the right way, as of his own, and not of \nGod's power. In another way one may desire to be like unto God in some \nrespect which is not natural to one; as if one were to desire to create \nheaven and  earth, which is proper to God; in which desire there would be \nsin. It was in this way that the devil desired to be as God. Not that he \ndesired to resemble God by being subject to no one else absolutely; for \nso he would be desiring his own 'not-being'; since no creature can exist \nexcept by holding its existence under God. But he desired resemblance \nwith God in this respect---by desiring, as his last end of beatitude, \nsomething which he could attain by the virtue of his own nature, turning \nhis appetite away from supernatural beatitude, which is attained by God's \ngrace. Or, if he desired as his last end that likeness of God which is \nbestowed by grace, he sought to have it by the power of his own nature; \nand not from Divine assistance according to God's ordering. This \nharmonizes with Anselm's opinion, who says [*De casu diaboli, iv.] that \n\"he sought that to which he would have come had he stood fast.\" These two \nviews in a manner coincide; because according to both, he sought to have \nfinal beatitude of his own power, whereas this is proper to God alone.\nSince, then, what exists of itself is the cause of what exists of \nanother, it follows from this furthermore that he sought to have dominion \nover others; wherein he also perversely wished to be like unto God.\nFrom this we have the answer to all the objections."

But if the changes are \ninstantaneous, then all at once and in the same instant there can be a \nterm to the first and the second change; thus in the same instant in \nwhich the moon is lit up by the sun, the atmosphere is lit up by the \nmoon. Now, it is manifest that creation is instantaneous; so also is the \nmovement of free-will in the angels; for, as has been already stated, \nthey have no occasion for comparison or discursive reasoning (Question [58], Article [3]). Consequently, there is nothing to hinder the term of creation and of \nfree-will from existing in the same instant.\nWe must therefore reply that, on the contrary, it was impossible for the \nangel to sin in the first instant by an inordinate act of free-will. For \nalthough a thing can begin to act in the first instant of its existence, \nnevertheless, that operation which begins with the existence comes of the \nagent from which it drew its nature; just as upward movement in fire \ncomes of its productive cause. Therefore, if there be anything which \nderives its nature from a defective cause, which can be the cause of a \ndefective action, it can in the first instant of its existence have a \ndefective operation; just as the leg, which is defective from birth, \nthrough a defect in the principle of generation, begins at once to limp. \nBut the agent which brought the angels into existence, namely, God, \ncannot be the cause of sin. Consequently it cannot be said that the devil \nwas wicked in the first instant of his creation.",
        "RP1": "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15), when it is stated \nthat \"the devil sins from the beginning,\" \"he is not to be thought of as \nsinning from the beginning wherein he was created, but from the beginning \nof sin\": that is to say, because he never went back from his sin.",

So the first \ninstant in the angels is understood to respond to the operation of the \nangelic mind, whereby it introspects itself by its evening knowledge \nbecause on the first day evening is mentioned, but not morning. This \noperation was good in them all. From such operation some of them were \nconverted to the praise of the Word by their morning knowledge while \nothers, absorbed in themselves, became night, \"swelling up with pride,\" \nas Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24).

If, then, in the angels we \nconsider the proneness to sin, it seems that the higher angels were less \nlikely to sin than the lower. On this account Damascene says (De Fide \nOrth. ii), that the highest of those who sinned was set over the \nterrestrial order. This opinion seems to agree with the view of the \nPlatonists, which Augustine quotes (De Civ. Dei vii, 6,7; x, 9,10,11). \nFor they said that all the gods were good; whereas some of the demons \nwere good, and some bad; naming as 'gods' the intellectual substances \nwhich are above the lunar sphere, and calling by the name of \"demons\" the \nintellectual substances which are beneath it, yet higher than men in the \norder of nature. Nor is this opinion to be rejected as contrary to faith; \nbecause the whole corporeal creation is governed by God through the \nangels, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4,5). Consequently there is \nnothing to prevent us from saying that the lower angels were divinely set \naside for presiding over the lower bodies, the higher over the higher \nbodies; and the highest to stand before God. And in this sense Damascene \nsays (De Fide Orth. ii) that they who fell were of the lower grade of \nangels; yet in that order some of them remained good.\nBut if the motive for sinning be considered, we find that it existed in \nthe higher angels more than in the lower. For, as has been said (Article [2]), \nthe demons' sin was pride; and the motive of pride is excellence, which \nwas greater in the higher spirits. Hence Gregory says that he who sinned \nwas the very highest of all. This seems to be the more probable view: \nbecause the angels' sin did not come of any proneness, but of free choice \nalone. Consequently that argument seems to have the more weight which is \ndrawn from the motive in sinning.

Such a statement deprives angels and saints of true beatitude, \nbecause everlasting stability is of the very nature of true beatitude; \nhence it is termed \"life everlasting.\" It is also contrary to the \nauthority of Sacred Scripture, which declares that demons and wicked men \nshall be sent \"into everlasting punishment,\" and the good brought \"into \neverlasting life.\" Consequently such an opinion must be considered \nerroneous; while according to Catholic Faith, it must be held firmly both \nthat the will of the good angels is confirmed in good, and that the will \nof the demons is obstinate in evil.\nWe must seek for the cause of this obstinacy, not in the gravity of the \nsin, but in the condition of their nature or state. For as Damascene says \n(De Fide Orth. ii), \"death is to men, what the fall is to the angels.\" \nNow it is clear that all the mortal sins of men, grave or less grave, are \npardonable before death; whereas after death they are without remission \nand endure for ever.\nTo find the cause, then, of this obstinacy, it must be borne in mind \nthat the appetitive power is in all things proportioned to the \napprehensive, whereby it is moved, as the movable by its mover. For the \nsensitive appetite seeks a particular good; while the will seeks the \nuniversal good, as was said above (Question [59], Article [1]); as also the sense \napprehends particular objects, while the intellect considers universals. \nNow the angel's apprehension differs from man's in this respect, that the \nangel by his intellect apprehends immovably, as we apprehend immovably \nfirst principles which are the object of the habit of \"intelligence\"; \nwhereas man by his reason apprehends movably, passing from one \nconsideration to another; and having the way open by which he may proceed \nto either of two opposites. Consequently man's will adheres to a thing \nmovably, and with the power of forsaking it and of clinging to the \nopposite; whereas the angel's will adheres fixedly and immovably. \nTherefore, if his will be considered before its adhesion, it can freely \nadhere either to this or to its opposite (namely, in such things as he \ndoes not will naturally); but after he has once adhered, he clings \nimmovably. So it is customary to say that man's free-will is flexible to \nthe opposite both before and after choice; but the angel's free-will is \nflexible either opposite before the choice, but not after. Therefore the \ngood angels who adhered to justice, were confirmed therein; whereas the \nwicked ones, sinning, are obstinate in sin. Later on we shall treat of \nthe obstinacy of men who are damned (SP, Question [98], Articles [1], 2).",

Now it is evident that the \ndemons would wish many things not to be, which are, and others to be, \nwhich are not: for, out of envy, they would wish others to be damned, who \nare saved. Consequently, sorrow must be said to exist in them: and \nespecially because it is of the very notion of punishment for it to be \nrepugnant to the will.

But this position is erroneous. In the first place, \nbecause it is contrary to Scripture, which, after narrating the \nproduction of each kind of corporeal creatures, subjoins, \"God saw that \nit was good\" (Gn. 1), as if to say that everything was brought into being \nfor the reason that it was good for it to be. But according to  Origen's \nopinion, the corporeal creature was made, not because it was good that it \nshould be, but that the evil in another might be punished. Secondly, \nbecause it would follow that the arrangement, which now exists, of the \ncorporeal world would arise from mere chance. For it the sun's body was \nmade what it is, that it might serve for a punishment suitable to some \nsin of a spiritual creature, it would follow, if other spiritual \ncreatures had sinned in the same way as the one to punish whom the sun \nhad been created, that many suns would exist in the world; and so of \nother things.

Furthermore, the entire universe, with all its parts, is \nordained towards God as its end, inasmuch as it imitates, as it were, and \nshows forth the Divine goodness, to the glory of God.

Thus he held that there exists an \nimmaterial man, and an immaterial horse, and so forth, and that from such \nthe individual sensible things that we see are constituted, in so far as \nin corporeal matter there abides the impression received from these \nseparate forms, by a kind of assimilation, or as he calls it, \n\"participation\" (Phaedo xlix).

This \ntheory seems to be the same as that of certain heretics of modern times, \nwho say that God indeed created all things, but that the devil formed \ncorporeal matter, and differentiated it into species.\nBut all these opinions seem to have a common origin; they all, in fact, \nsought for a cause of forms as though the form were of itself brought \ninto being. Whereas, as Aristotle (Metaph. vii, text. 26,27,28), proves, \nwhat is, properly speaking, made, is the \"composite.\" Now, such are the \nforms of corruptible things that at one time they exist and at another \nexist not, without being themselves generated or corrupted, but by reason \nof the generation or corruption of the \"composite\"; since even forms have \nnot being, but composites have being through forms: for, according to a \nthing's mode of being, is the mode in which it is brought into being. \nSince, then, like is produced from like, we must not look for the cause \nof corporeal forms in any immaterial form, but in something that is \ncomposite, as this fire is generated by that fire. Corporeal forms, \ntherefore, are caused, not as emanations from some immaterial form, but \nby matter being brought from potentiality into act by some composite \nagent. But since the composite agent, which is a body, is moved by a \ncreated spiritual substance, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4,5), it \nfollows further that even corporeal forms are derived from spiritual  \nsubstances, not emanating from them, but as the term of their movement. \nAnd, further still, the species of the angelic intellect, which are, as \nit were, the seminal types of corporeal forms, must be referred to God as \nthe first cause. But in the first production of corporeal creatures no \ntransmutation from potentiality to act can have taken place, and \naccordingly, the corporeal forms that bodies had when first produced came \nimmediately form God, whose bidding alone matter obeys, as its own proper \ncause. To signify this, Moses prefaces each work with the words, \"God \nsaid, Let this thing be,\" or \"that,\" to denote the formation of all \nthings by the Word of God, from Whom, according to Augustine [*Tract. i. \nin Joan. and Gen. ad lit. i. 4], is \"all form and fitness and concord of \nparts.\"",
        "RP1": "By immaterial forms Boethius understands the types of \nthings in the mind of God. Thus the Apostle says (Heb. 11:3): \"By faith \nwe understand that the world was framed by the Word of God; that from \ninvisible things visible things might be made.\" But if by immaterial \nforms he understands the angels, we say that from them come material \nforms, not by emanation, but by motion.",
        "RP2": "Forms received into matter are to be referred, not to \nself-subsisting forms of the same type, as the Platonists held, but \neither to intelligible forms of the angelic intellect, from which they \nproceed by movement, or, still higher, to the types in the Divine \nintellect, by which the seeds of forms are implanted in created things, \nthat they may be able to be brought by movement into act.",

For it is said (Gn. 1:2): \"The earth was void and empty,\" or \n\"invisible and shapeless,\" according to another version [*Septuagint]; by \nwhich is understood the formlessness of matter, as Augustine says \n(Confess. xii, 12). Therefore matter was  formless until it received its \nform.",
        "OB2": "Further, nature in its working imitates the working of God, as a \nsecondary cause imitates a first cause. But in the working of nature \nformlessness precedes form in time. It does so, therefore, in the Divine \nworking.",
        "OB3": "Further, matter is higher than accident, for matter is part of \nsubstance. But God can effect that accident exist without substance, as \nin the Sacrament of the Altar. He could, therefore, cause matter to exist \nwithout form.",
        "CON": "An imperfect effect proves imperfection in the agent. \nBut God is an agent absolutely perfect; wherefore it is said of Him (Dt. 32:4): \"The works of God are perfect.\" Therefore the work of His creation \nwas at no time formless. Further, the formation of corporeal creatures \nwas effected by the work of distinction. But confusion is opposed to \ndistinction, as formlessness to form. It, therefore, formlessness \npreceded in time the formation of matter, it follows that at the \nbeginning confusion, called by the ancients chaos, existed in the \ncorporeal creation.",
        "ANS": "On this point holy men differ in opinion. Augustine for \ninstance (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), believes that the formlessness of matter \nwas not prior in time to its formation, but only in origin or the order \nof nature, whereas others, as Basil (Hom. ii In Hexaem.), Ambrose (In \nHexaem. i), and Chrysostom (Hom. ii In Gen.), hold that formlessness of \nmatter preceded in time its formation. And although these opinions seem \nmutually contradictory, in reality they differ but little; for Augustine \ntakes the formlessness of matter in a different sense from the others. In \nhis sense it means the absence of all form, and if we thus understand it \nwe cannot say that the formlessness of matter was prior in time either to \nits formation or to its distinction. As to formation, the argument is \nclear. For it formless matter preceded in duration, it already existed; \nfor this is implied by duration, since the end of creation is being in \nact: and act itself is a form. To say, then, that matter preceded, but \nwithout form, is to say that being existed actually, yet without act, \nwhich is a contradiction in terms. Nor can it be said that it possessed \nsome common form, on which afterwards supervened the different forms that \ndistinguish it. For this would be to hold the opinion of the ancient \nnatural philosophers, who maintained that primary matter was some \ncorporeal thing in act, as fire, air, water, or some intermediate \nsubstance. Hence, it followed that to be made means merely to be changed; \nfor since that preceding form bestowed actual substantial being, and made \nsome particular thing to be, it would result that the supervening form \nwould not simply make an actual being, but 'this' actual being; which is \nthe proper effect of an accidental form. Thus the consequent forms would \nbe merely accidents, implying not generation, but alteration. Hence we \nmust assert that primary matter was not created altogether formless, nor \nunder any one common form, but under distinct forms. And so, if the \nformlessness  of matter be taken as referring to the condition of primary \nmatter, which in itself is formless, this formlessness did not precede in \ntime its formation or distinction, but only in origin and nature, as \nAugustine says; in the same way as potentiality is prior to act, and the \npart to the whole. But the other holy writers understand by formlessness, \nnot the exclusion of all form, but the absence of that beauty and \ncomeliness which are now apparent in the corporeal creation. Accordingly \nthey say that the formlessness of corporeal matter preceded its form in \nduration. And so, when this is considered, it appears that Augustine \nagrees with them in some respects, and in others disagrees, as will be \nshown later (Question [69], Article [1]; Question [74], Article [2]).\nAs far as may be gathered from the text of Genesis a threefold beauty \nwas wanting to corporeal creatures, for which reason they are said to be \nwithout form. For the beauty of light was wanting to all that transparent \nbody which we call the heavens, whence it is said that \"darkness was upon \nthe fact of the deep.\" And the earth lacked beauty in two ways: first, \nthat beauty which it acquired when its watery veil was withdrawn, and so \nwe read that \"the earth was void,\" or \"invisible,\" inasmuch as the waters \ncovered and concealed it from view; secondly, that which it derives from \nbeing adorned by herbs and plants, for which reason it is called \"empty,\" \nor, according to another reading [*Septuagint], \"shapeless\"---that is, \nunadorned. Thus after mention of two created natures, the heaven and the \nearth, the formlessness of the heaven is indicated by the words, \n\"darkness was upon the face of the deep,\" since the air is included under \nheaven; and the formlessness of the earth, by the words, \"the earth was \nvoid and empty.\"",
        "RP1": "The word earth is taken differently in this passage by \nAugustine, and by other writers. Augustine holds that by the words \n\"earth\" and \"water,\" in this passage. primary matter itself is signified \non account of its being impossible for Moses to make the idea of such \nmatter intelligible to an ignorant people, except under the similitude of \nwell-known objects. Hence he uses a variety of figures in speaking of it, \ncalling it not water only, nor earth only, lest they should think it to \nbe in very truth water or earth. At the same time it has so far a \nlikeness to earth, in that it is susceptible of form, and to water in its \nadaptability to a variety of forms. In this respect, then, the earth is \nsaid to be \"void and empty,\" or \"invisible and shapeless,\" that matter is \nknown by means of form. Hence, considered in itself, it is called \n\"invisible\" or \"void,\" and its potentiality is completed by form; thus \nPlato says that matter is \"place\" [*Timaeus, quoted by Aristotle, Phys. \niv, text. 15]. But other holy writers understand by earth the element of \nearth, and we have said (Article [1]) how, in this sense, the earth was, \naccording to them, without form.",
        "RP2": "Nature produces effect in act from being in potentiality; \nand consequently in the operations of nature potentiality must precede \nact in time, and formlessness precede form. But God produces being in act \nout of nothing, and can, therefore, produce a perfect thing in an \ninstant, according to the  greatness of His power.",
        "RP3": "Accident, inasmuch as it is a form, is a kind of act; \nwhereas matter, as such, is essentially being in potentiality. Hence it \nis more repugnant that matter should be in act without form, than for \naccident to be without subject.\nIn reply to the first argument in the contrary sense, we say that if, \naccording to some holy writers, formlessness was prior in time to the \ninforming of matter, this arose, not from want of power on God's part, \nbut from His wisdom, and from the design of preserving due order in the \ndisposition of creatures by developing perfection from imperfection.\nIn reply to the second argument, we say that certain of the ancient \nnatural philosophers maintained confusion devoid of all distinction; \nexcept Anaxagoras, who taught that the intellect alone was distinct and \nwithout admixture. But previous to the work of distinction Holy Scripture \nenumerates several kinds of differentiation, the first being that of the \nheaven from the earth, in which even a material distinction is expressed, \nas will be shown later (Article [3]; Question [68], Article [1]). This is signified by the \nwords, \"In the beginning God created heaven and earth.\" The second \ndistinction mentioned is that of the elements according to their forms, \nsince both earth and water are named. That air and fire are not mentioned \nby name is due to the fact that the corporeal nature of these would not \nbe so evident as that of earth and water, to the ignorant people to whom \nMoses spoke. Plato (Timaeus xxvi), nevertheless, understood air to be \nsignified by the words, \"Spirit of God,\" since spirit is another name for \nair, and considered that by the word heaven is meant fire, for he held \nheaven to be composed of fire, as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei viii, \n11). But Rabbi Moses (Perplex. ii), though otherwise agreeing with Plato, \nsays that fire is signified by the word darkness, since, said he, fire \ndoes not shine in its own sphere. However, it seems more reasonable to \nhold to what we stated above; because by the words \"Spirit of God\" \nScripture usually means the Holy Ghost, Who is said to \"move over the \nwaters,\" not, indeed, in bodily shape, but as the craftsman's will may be \nsaid to move over the material to which he intends to give a form. The \nthird distinction is that of place; since the earth is said to be under \nthe waters that rendered it invisible, whilst the air, the subject of \ndarkness, is described as being above the waters, in the words: \"Darkness \nwas upon the face of the deep.\" The remaining distinctions will appear \nfrom what follows (Question [71])."

        "ANS": "On this question the opinions of philosophers have \ndiffered. Plato and all who preceded Aristotle held that all bodies are \nof the nature of the four elements. Hence because the four elements have \none common matter, as their mutual generation and corruption prove, it \nfollowed that the matter of all bodies is the same. But the fact of the \nincorruptibility of some bodies was ascribed by Plato, not to the \ncondition of matter, but to the will of the artificer, God, Whom he \nrepresents as saying to the heavenly bodies: \"By your own nature you are \nsubject to dissolution, but by My will you are indissoluble, for My will \nis more powerful than the link that binds you together.\" But this theory \nAristotle (De Caelo i, text. 5) disproves by the natural movements of \nbodies. For since, he says, the heavenly bodies have a natural movement, \ndifferent from that of the elements, it follows that they have a \ndifferent nature from them. For movement in a circle, which is proper to \nthe heavenly bodies, is not by contraries, whereas the movements of the \nelements are mutually opposite, one tending upwards, another downwards: \nso, therefore, the heavenly body is without contrariety, whereas the \nelemental bodies have contrariety in their nature. And as generation and \ncorruption are from contraries, it follows that, whereas the elements are \ncorruptible, the heavenly bodies are incorruptible. But in spite of this \ndifference of natural corruption and incorruption, Avicebron taught unity \nof matter in all bodies, arguing from their unity of form. And, indeed, \nif corporeity were one form in itself, on which the other forms that \ndistinguish bodies from each other supervene, this argument would \nnecessarily be true; for this form of corporeity would inhere in matter \nimmutably and so far all bodies would be incorruptible. But corruption \nwould then be merely accidental through the disappearance of successive \nforms---that is to say, it would be corruption, not pure and simple, but \npartial, since a being in act would subsist under the transient form. \nThus the ancient natural philosophers taught that the substratum of \nbodies  was some actual being, such as air or fire. But supposing that no \nform exists in corruptible bodies which remains subsisting beneath \ngeneration and corruption, it follows necessarily that the matter of \ncorruptible and incorruptible bodies is not the same. For matter, as it \nis in itself, is in potentiality to form.\nConsidered in itself, then, it is in potentiality in respect to all \nthose forms to which it is common, and in receiving any one form it is in \nact only as regards that form. Hence it remains in potentiality to all \nother forms. And this is the case even where some forms are more perfect \nthan others, and contain these others virtually in themselves. For \npotentiality in itself is indifferent with respect to perfection and \nimperfection, so that under an imperfect form it is in potentiality to a \nperfect form, and \"vice versa.\" Matter, therefore, whilst existing under \nthe form of an incorruptible body, would be in potentiality to the form \nof a corruptible body; and as it does not actually possess the latter, it \nhas both form and the privation of form; for want of a form in that which \nis in potentiality thereto is privation. But this condition implies \ncorruptibility. It is therefore impossible that bodies by nature \ncorruptible, and those by nature incorruptible, should possess the same \nmatter.\nNeither can we say, as Averroes [*De Substantia Orbis ii.] imagines, \nthat a heavenly body itself is the matter of the heaven---beings in \npotentiality with regard to place, though not to being, and that its form \nis a separate substance united to it as its motive force. For it is \nimpossible to suppose any being in act, unless in its totality it be act \nand form, or be something which has act or form. Setting aside, then, in \nthought, the separate substance stated to be endowed with motive power, \nif the heavenly body is not something having form---that is, something \ncomposed of a form and the subject of that form---it follows that in its \ntotality it is form and act. But every such thing is something actually \nunderstood, which the heavenly bodies are not, being sensible. It \nfollows, then, that the matter of the heavenly bodies, considered in \nitself, is in potentiality to that form alone which it actually \npossesses. Nor does it concern the point at issue to inquire whether this \nis a soul or any other thing. Hence this form perfects this matter in \nsuch a way that there remains in it no potentiality with respect to \nbeing, but only to place, as Aristotle [*De Coelo i, text. 20] says. So, \nthen, the matter of the heavenly bodies and of the elements is not the \nsame, except by analogy, in so far as they agree in the character of \npotentiality.",

Strabus and \nBede teach that there is an empyrean heaven, because the firmament, which \nthey take to mean the sidereal heaven, is said to have been made, not in \nthe beginning, but on the second day: whereas the reason given by Basil \nis that otherwise God would seem to have made darkness His first work, as \nthe Manicheans falsely assert, when they call the God of the Old \nTestament the God of darkness. These reasons, however, are not very \ncogent. For the question of the firmament, said to have been made on the \nsecond day, is solved in one way by Augustine, and in another by other \nholy writers. But the question of the darkness is explained according to \nAugustine [*Gen. ad lit. i; vii.], by supposing that formlessness, \nsignified by darkness, preceded form not by duration, but by origin. \nAccording to others, however, since darkness is no creature, but a \nprivation of light, it is a proof of Divine wisdom, that the things it \ncreated from nothing it produced first of all in an imperfect state, and \nafterwards brought them to perfection. But a better reason can be drawn \nfrom the state of glory itself. For in the reward to come a two-fold \nglory is looked for, spiritual and corporeal, not only in the human body \nto be glorified, but in the whole world which is to be made new. Now the \nspiritual glory began with the beginning of the world, in the blessedness \nof the angels, equality with whom is promised to the saints. It was \nfitting, then, that even from the beginning, there should be made some \nbeginning of bodily glory in something corporeal, free at the very outset \nfrom the servitude of corruption and change, and wholly luminous, even as \nthe whole bodily creation, after the Resurrection, is expected to be. So, \nthen, that heaven is called the empyrean, i.e. fiery, not from its heat, \nbut from its brightness. It is to be noticed, however, that Augustine (De \nCiv. Dei x, 9,27) says that Porphyry sets the demons apart from the \nangels by supposing that the former inhabit the air, the latter the \nether, or empyrean. But Porphyry, as a Platonist, held the heaven, known \nas sidereal, to be fiery, and therefore called it empyrean or ethereal, \ntaking ethereal to denote the burning of flame, and not as Aristotle \nunderstands it, swiftness of movement (De Coel. i, text. 22). This much \nhas been said to prevent anyone from supposing that Augustine maintained \nan empyrean heaven in the sense understood by modern writers.",

Hier. xii). For this reason it may \nbe said that the influence of the empyrean upon that which is called the \nfirst heaven, and is moved, produces therein not something that comes and \ngoes as a result of movement, but something of a fixed and stable nature, \nas the power of conservation or causation, or something of the kind \npertaining to dignity.",

Thus we say, \"Seeing how it tastes,\" or \"smells,\" or \n\"burns. \"Further, sight is applied to knowledge obtained through the \nintellect, as in those words: \"Blessed are the clean of heart, for they \nshall see God\" (Mt. 5:8).

        "CON": "Two bodies cannot occupy the same place simultaneously. \nBut this is the case with light and air. Therefore light is not a body.",
        "ANS": "Light cannot be a body, for three evident reasons. First, \non the part of place. For the place of any one body is different from \nthat of any other, nor is it possible, naturally speaking, for any two \nbodies of whatever nature, to exist simultaneously in the same place; \nsince contiguity requires distinction of place.\nThe second reason is from movement. For if light were a body, its \ndiffusion would be the local movement of a body. Now no local movement of \na body can be instantaneous, as everything that moves from one place to \nanother must pass through the intervening space before reaching the end: \nwhereas the diffusion of light is instantaneous. Nor can it be argued \nthat the time required is too short to be perceived; for though this may \nbe the case in short distances, it cannot be so in distances so great as \nthat which separates the East from the West. Yet as soon as the sun is at \nthe horizon, the whole hemisphere is illuminated from end to end. It must \nalso be borne in mind on the part of movement that whereas all bodies \nhave their natural determinate movement, that of light is indifferent as \nregards direction, working equally in a circle as in a straight line. \nHence it appears that the diffusion of light is not the local movement of \na body.\nThe third reason is from generation and corruption. For if light were a \nbody, it would follow that whenever the air is darkened by the absence of \nthe luminary, the body of light would be corrupted, and its matter would \nreceive a new form. But unless we are to say that darkness is a body, \nthis does not appear to be the case. Neither does it appear from what \nmatter a body can be daily generated large enough to fill the intervening \nhemisphere. Also it would be absurd to say that a body of so great a bulk \nis corrupted by the mere absence of the luminary. And should anyone reply \nthat it is not corrupted, but approaches and moves around with the sun, \nwe may ask why it is that when a lighted candle is obscured by the \nintervening object the whole room is darkened? It is not that the light \nis condensed round the candle when this is done, since it burns no more \nbrightly then than it burned before.\nSince, therefore, these things are repugnant, not only to reason, but to \ncommon sense, we must conclude that light cannot be a body.",

But color does not do this, for we \ndo not speak of the air as colored. Secondly, because light produces \nnatural effects, for by the rays of the sun bodies are warmed, and \nnatural changes cannot be brought about by mere intentions. Others have \nsaid that light is the sun's substantial form, but this also seems \nimpossible for two reasons. First, because substantial forms are not of \nthemselves objects of the senses; for the object of the intellect is what \na thing is, as is said De Anima iii, text. 26: whereas light is visible \nof itself. In the second place, because it is impossible that what is the \nsubstantial form of one thing should be the accidental form of another; \nsince substantial forms of their very nature constitute species: \nwherefore the substantial form always and everywhere accompanies the \nspecies. But light is not the substantial form of air, for if it were, \nthe air would be destroyed when light is withdrawn. Hence it cannot be \nthe substantial form of the sun.\nWe must say, then, that as heat is an active quality consequent on the \nsubstantial form of fire, so light is an active quality consequent on the \nsubstantial form of the sun, or of another body that is of itself \nluminous, if there is any such body.

When, \nhowever, substantial form is received imperfectly, so as to be, as it \nwere, in process of being received, rather than fully impressed, the \nconsequent quality lasts for a time but is not permanent; as may be seen \nwhen water which has been heated returns in time to its natural state. \nBut light is not produced by the transmutation of matter, as though \nmatter were in receipt of a substantial form, and light were a certain \ninception of substantial form.

Dei xi, 9,33) that Moses could not have \nfittingly passed over the production of the spiritual creature, and \ntherefore when we read, \"In the beginning God created heaven and earth,\" \na spiritual nature as yet formless is to be understood by the word \n\"heaven,\" and formless matter of the corporeal creature by the word \n\"earth.\" And spiritual nature was formed first, as being of higher \ndignity than corporeal. The forming, therefore, of this spiritual nature \nis signified by the production of light, that is to say, of spiritual \nlight. For a spiritual nature receives its form by the enlightenment \nwhereby it is led to adhere to the Word of God.\nOther writers think that the production of spiritual creatures was \npurposely omitted by Moses, and give various reasons. Basil [*Hom. i in \nHexaem.] says that Moses begins his narrative from the beginning of time \nwhich belongs to sensible things; but that the spiritual or angelic \ncreation is passed over, as created beforehand.\nChrysostom [*Hom. ii in Genes.] gives as a reason for the omission that \nMoses was addressing an ignorant people, to whom material things alone \nappealed, and whom he was endeavoring to withdraw from the service of \nidols. It would have been to them a pretext for idolatry if he had spoken \nto them of natures spiritual in substance and nobler than all corporeal \ncreatures; for they would have paid them Divine worship, since they were \nprone to worship as gods even the sun, moon, and stars, which was \nforbidden them (Dt. 4).\nBut mention is made of several kinds of formlessness, in regard to the \ncorporeal creature. One is where we read that \"the earth was void and \nempty,\" and another where it is said that \"darkness was upon the face of \nthe deep.\" Now it seems to be required, for two reasons, that the \nformlessness of darkness should be removed first of all by the production \nof light. In the first place because light is a quality of the first \nbody, as was stated (Article [3]), and thus by means of light it was fitting \nthat the world should first receive its form. The second reason is \nbecause light is a common quality. For light is common to terrestrial and \ncelestial bodies. But as in knowledge we proceed from general principles, \nso do we in work of every kind. For the living thing is generated before \nthe animal, and the animal before the man, as is shown in De Gener. Anim. \nii, 3. It was fitting, then, as an evidence of the Divine wisdom, that \namong the works of distinction the production of light should take first \nplace, since light is a form of the primary body, and because it is more \ncommon quality.\nBasil [*Hom. ii in Hexaem.], indeed, adds a third reason: that all other \nthings are made manifest by light. And there is yet a fourth, already \ntouched upon in the objections; that day cannot be unless light exists, \nwhich was made therefore on the first day.",
        "RP1": "According to the opinion of those who hold that the \nformlessness of matter preceded its form in duration, matter must be held \nto have been created at the beginning with substantial forms, afterwards \nreceiving those that are accidental, among which light holds the first \nplace.",
        "RP2": "In the opinion of some the light here spoken of was a kind \nof luminous nebula, and that on the making of the sun this returned to \nthe matter of which it had been formed. But this cannot well be \nmaintained, as in the beginning of Genesis Holy Scripture records the \ninstitution of that order of nature which henceforth is to endure. We \ncannot, then, say that what was made at that time afterwards ceased to \nexist.\nOthers, therefore, held that this luminous nebula continues in \nexistence, but so closely attached to the sun as to be indistinguishable. \nBut this is as much as to say that it is superfluous, whereas none of \nGod's works have been made in vain. On this account it is held by some \nthat the sun's body was made out of this nebula. This, too, is impossible \nto those at least who believe that the sun is different in its nature \nfrom the four elements, and naturally incorruptible. For in that case its \nmatter cannot take on another form.\nI answer, then, with Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv), that the light was the \nsun's light, formless as yet, being already the solar substance, and \npossessing illuminative power in a general way, to which was afterwards \nadded the special and determinative power required to produce determinate \neffects. Thus, then, in the production of this light a triple distinction \nwas made between light and darkness. First, as to the cause, forasmuch as \nin the substance of the sun we have the cause of light, and in the opaque \nnature of the earth the cause of darkness. Secondly, as to place, for in \none hemisphere there was light, in the other darkness. Thirdly, as to \ntime; because there was light for one and darkness for another in the \nsame hemisphere; and this is signified by the words, \"He called the light \nday, and the darkness night.\"",
        "RP3": "Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) that day and night were \nthen caused by expansion and contraction of light, rather than by \nmovement. But Augustine objects to this (Gen. ad lit. i), that there was \nno reason for this vicissitude of expansion and contraction since there \nwere neither men nor animals on the earth at that time, for whose service \nthis was required. Nor does the nature of a luminous body seem to admit \nof the withdrawal of light, so long as the body is actually present; \nthough this might be effected by a miracle. As to this, however, \nAugustine remarks (Gen. ad lit. i) that in the first founding of the \norder of nature we must not look for miracles, but for what is in \naccordance with nature. We hold, then, that the movement of the heavens \nis twofold. Of these movements, one is common to the entire heaven, and \nis the cause of day and night. This, as it seems, had its beginning on \nthe first day. The other varies in proportion as it affects various \nbodies, and by its variations is the cause of the succession of days, \nmonths, and years. Thus it is, that in the account of the first day the \ndistinction between day and night alone is mentioned; this distinction \nbeing brought about by the common movement of the heavens. The further \ndistinction into successive days, seasons, and years recorded as begun on \nthe fourth day, in the words, \"let them be for seasons, and for days, and \nyears\" is due to proper movements.",
        "RP4": "As Augustine teaches (Confess. xii; Gen. ad lit. 1,15), \nformlessness did not precede forms in duration; and so we must understand \nthe production of light to signify the formation of spiritual creatures, \nnot, indeed, with the perfection of glory, in which they were not \ncreated, but with the perfection of grace, which they possessed from \ntheir creation as said above (Question [62], Article [3]).  Thus the division of light \nfrom darkness will denote the distinction of the spiritual creature from \nother created things as yet without form. But if all created things \nreceived their form at the same time, the darkness must be held to mean \nthe spiritual darkness of the wicked, not as existing from the beginning \nbut such as God foresaw would exist."

        "ANS": "In discussing questions of this kind two rules are to \nobserved, as Augustine teaches (Gen. ad lit. i, 18). The first is, to \nhold the truth of Scripture without wavering. The second is that since \nHoly Scripture can be explained in a multiplicity of senses, one should \nadhere to a particular explanation, only in such measure as to be ready \nto abandon it, if it be proved with certainty to be false; lest Holy \nScripture be exposed to the ridicule of unbelievers, and obstacles be \nplaced to their believing.\nWe say, therefore, that the words which speak of the firmament  as made \non the second day can be understood in two senses. They may be \nunderstood, first, of the starry firmament, on which point it is \nnecessary to set forth the different opinions of philosophers. Some of \nthese believed it to be composed of the elements; and this was the \nopinion of Empedocles, who, however, held further that the body of the \nfirmament was not susceptible of dissolution, because its parts are, so \nto say, not in disunion, but in harmony. Others held the firmament to be \nof the nature of the four elements, not, indeed, compounded of them, but \nbeing as it were a simple element. Such was the opinion of Plato, who \nheld that element to be fire. Others, again, have held that the heaven is \nnot of the nature of the four elements, but is itself a fifth body, \nexisting over and above these. This is the opinion of Aristotle (De Coel. \ni, text. 6,32).\nAccording to the first opinion, it may, strictly speaking, be granted \nthat the firmament was made, even as to substance, on the second day. For \nit is part of the work of creation to produce the substance of the \nelements, while it belongs to the work of distinction and adornment to \ngive forms to the elements that pre-exist.\nBut the belief that the firmament was made, as to its substance, on the \nsecond day is incompatible with the opinion of Plato, according to whom \nthe making of the firmament implies the production of the element of \nfire. This production, however, belongs to the work of creation, at \nleast, according to those who hold that formlessness of matter preceded \nin time its formation, since the first form received by matter is the \nelemental.\nStill less compatible with the belief that the substance of the \nfirmament was produced on the second day is the opinion of Aristotle, \nseeing that the mention of days denotes succession of time, whereas the \nfirmament, being naturally incorruptible, is of a matter not susceptible \nof change of form; wherefore it could not be made out of matter existing \nantecedently in time.\nHence to produce the substance of the firmament belongs to the work of \ncreation. But its formation, in some degree, belongs to the second day, \naccording to both opinions: for as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), the \nlight of the sun was without form during the first three days, and \nafterwards, on the fourth day, received its form.\nIf, however, we take these days to denote merely sequence in the natural \norder, as Augustine holds (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,24), and not succession in \ntime, there is then nothing to prevent our saying, whilst holding any one \nof the opinions given above, that the substantial formation of the \nfirmament belongs to the second day.\nAnother possible explanation is to understand by the firmament that was \nmade on the second day, not that in which the stars are set, but the part \nof the atmosphere where the clouds are collected, and which has received \nthe name firmament from the firmness and  density of the air. \"For a body \nis called firm,\" that is dense and solid, \"thereby differing from a \nmathematical body\" as is remarked by Basil (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). If, \nthen, this explanation is adopted none of these opinions will be found \nrepugnant to reason. Augustine, in fact (Gen. ad lit. ii, 4), recommends \nit thus: \"I consider this view of the question worthy of all \ncommendation, as neither contrary to faith nor difficult to be proved and \nbelieved.\"",
        "RP1": "According to Chrysostom (Hom. iii in Genes.), Moses \nprefaces his record by speaking of the works of God collectively, in the \nwords, \"In the beginning God created heaven and earth,\" and then proceeds \nto explain them part by part; in somewhat the same way as one might say: \n\"This house was constructed by that builder,\" and then add: \"First, he \nlaid the foundations, then built the walls, and thirdly, put on the \nroof.\" In accepting this explanation we are, therefore, not bound to hold \nthat a different heaven is spoken of in the words: \"In the beginning God \ncreated heaven and earth,\" and when we read that the firmament was made \non the second day.\nWe may also say that the heaven recorded as created in the beginning is \nnot the same as that made on the second day; and there are several senses \nin which this may be understood. Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. i, 9) that \nthe heaven recorded as made on the first day is the formless spiritual \nnature, and that the heaven of the second day is the corporeal heaven. \nAccording to Bede (Hexaem. i) and Strabus, the heaven made on the first \nday is the empyrean, and the firmament made on the second day, the starry \nheaven. According to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii) that of the first day \nwas spherical in form and without stars, the same, in fact, that the \nphilosophers speak of, calling it the ninth sphere, and the primary \nmovable body that moves with diurnal movement: while by the firmament \nmade on the second day he understands the starry heaven. According to \nanother theory, touched upon by Augustine [*Gen. ad lit. ii, 1] the \nheaven made on the first day was the starry heaven, and the firmament \nmade on the second day was that region of the air where the clouds are \ncollected, which is also called heaven, but equivocally. And to show that \nthe word is here used in an equivocal sense, it is expressly said that \n\"God called the firmament heaven\"; just as in a preceding verse it said \nthat \"God called the light day\" (since the word \"day\" is also used to \ndenote a space of twenty-four hours). Other instances of a similar use \noccur, as pointed out by Rabbi Moses.\nThe second and third objections are sufficiently answered by what has \nbeen already said."

Origen says (Hom. i in Gen.) that the \nwaters that are above the firmament are \"spiritual substances.\" Wherefore \nit is written (Ps. 148:4): \"Let the waters that are above the heavens \npraise the name of the Lord,\" and (Dn. 3:60): \"Ye waters that are above \nthe heavens, bless the Lord.\"To this Basil answers (Hom. iii in Hexaem.) \nthat these words do not mean that these waters are rational creatures, \nbut that \"the thoughtful contemplation of them by those who understand \nfulfils the glory of the Creator.\" Hence in the same context, fire, hail, \nand other like creatures, are invoked in the same way, though no one \nwould attribute reason to these.\nWe must hold, then, these waters to be material, but their exact nature \nwill be differently defined according as opinions on the firmament \ndiffer. For if by the firmament we understand the starry heaven, and as \nbeing of the nature of the four elements, for the same reason it may be \nbelieved that the waters above the heaven are of the same nature as the \nelemental waters. But if by the firmament we understand the starry \nheaven, not, however, as being of the nature of the four elements then \nthe waters above the firmament will not be of the same nature as the \nelemental waters, but just as, according to Strabus, one heaven is called \nempyrean, that is, fiery, solely on account of its splendor: so this \nother heaven will be called aqueous solely on account of its \ntransparence; and this heaven is above the starry heaven. Again, if the \nfirmament is held to be of other nature than the elements, it may still \nbe said to divide the waters, if we understand by water not the element \nbut formless matter. Augustine, in fact, says (Super Gen. cont. Manich. \ni, 5,7) that whatever divides bodies from bodies can be said to divide \nwaters from waters.\nIf, however, we understand by the firmament that part of the air in \nwhich the clouds are collected, then the waters above the  firmament must \nrather be the vapors resolved from the waters which are raised above a \npart of the atmosphere, and from which the rain falls. But to say, as \nsome writers alluded to by Augustine (Gen. ad lit. ii, 4), that waters \nresolved into vapor may be lifted above the starry heaven, is a mere \nabsurdity. The solid nature of the firmament, the intervening region of \nfire, wherein all vapor must be consumed, the tendency in light and \nrarefied bodies to drift to one spot beneath the vault of the moon, as \nwell as the fact that vapors are perceived not to rise even to the tops \nof the higher mountains, all to go to show the impossibility of this. Nor \nis it less absurd to say, in support of this opinion, that bodies may be \nrarefied infinitely, since natural bodies cannot be infinitely rarefied \nor divided, but up to a certain point only.",
        "RP1": "Some have attempted to solve this difficulty by supposing \nthat in spite of the natural gravity of water, it is kept in its place \nabove the firmament by the Divine power. Augustine (Gen. ad lit. ii, 1), \nhowever will not admit this solution, but says \"It is our business here \nto inquire how God has constituted the natures of His creatures, not how \nfar it may have pleased Him to work on them by way of miracle.\" We leave \nthis view, then, and answer that according to the last two opinions on \nthe firmament and the waters the solution appears from what has been \nsaid. According to the first opinion, an order of the elements must be \nsupposed different from that given by Aristotle, that is to say, that the \nwaters surrounding the earth are of a dense consistency, and those around \nthe firmament of a rarer consistency, in proportion to the respective \ndensity of the earth and of the heaven.\nOr by the water, as stated, we may understand the matter of bodies to be \nsignified.",
        "RP2": "The solution is clear from what has been said, according to \nthe last two opinions. But according to the first opinion, Basil gives \ntwo replies (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). He answers first, that a body seen as \nconcave beneath need not necessarily be rounded, or convex, above. \nSecondly, that the waters above the firmament are not fluid, but exist \noutside it in a solid state, as a mass of ice, and that this is the \ncrystalline heaven of some writers.",
        "RP3": "According to the third opinion given, the waters above the \nfirmament have been raised in the form of vapors, and serve to give rain \nto the earth. But according to the second opinion, they are above the \nheaven that is wholly transparent and starless. This, according to some, \nis the primary mobile, the cause of the daily revolution of the entire \nheaven, whereby the continuance of generation is secured. In the same way \nthe starry heaven, by the zodiacal movement, is the cause whereby \ndifferent bodies are generated or corrupted, through the rising and \nsetting of the stars, and their various influences. But according to the \nfirst opinion these waters are set there to temper the heat of the \ncelestial bodies, as Basil supposes (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). And Augustine \nsays (Gen. ad lit. ii, 5) that some have considered this  to be proved by \nthe extreme cold of Saturn owing to its nearness to the waters that are \nabove the firmament."

Thus in the words, \"Darkness was upon \nthe face of the deep,\" the word \"deep\" might be taken to mean the \ninfinite mass of water, understood as the principle of all other bodies. \nThese philosophers also taught that not all corporeal things are confined \nbeneath the heaven perceived by our senses, but that a body of water, \ninfinite in extent, exists above that heaven. On this view the firmament \nof heaven might be said to divide the waters without from those \nwithin---that is to say, from all bodies under the heaven, since they \ntook water to be the principle of them all.\nAs, however, this theory can be shown to be false by solid reasons, it \ncannot be held to be the sense of Holy Scripture. It should rather be \nconsidered that Moses was speaking to ignorant people, and that out of \ncondescension to their weakness he put before them only such things as \nare apparent to sense. Now even the most uneducated can perceive by their \nsenses that earth and water are corporeal, whereas it is not evident to \nall that air also is corporeal, for there have even been philosophers who \nsaid that air is nothing, and called a space filled with air a vacuum.\nMoses, then, while he expressly mentions water and earth, makes no \nexpress mention of air by name, to avoid setting before  ignorant persons \nsomething beyond their knowledge. In order, however, to express the truth \nto those capable of understanding it, he implies in the words: \"Darkness \nwas upon the face of the deep,\" the existence of air as attendant, so to \nsay, upon the water. For it may be understood from these words that over \nthe face of the water a transparent body was extended, the subject of \nlight and darkness, which, in fact, is the air.\nWhether, then, we understand by the firmament the starry heaven, or the \ncloudy region of the air, it is true to say that it divides the waters \nfrom the waters, according as we take water to denote formless matter, or \nany kind of transparent body, as fittingly designated under the name of \nwaters.

The latter says that there is only one \nheaven (Hom. iv in Gen.), and that the words 'heavens of heavens' are \nmerely the translation of the Hebrew idiom according to which the word is \nalways used in the plural, just as in Latin there are many nouns that are \nwanting in the singular. On the other hand, Basil (Hom. iii in Hexaem.), \nwhom Damascene follows (De Fide Orth. ii), says that there are many \nheavens. The difference, however, is more nominal than real. For \nChrysostom means by the one heaven the whole body that is above the earth \nand the water, for which reason the birds that fly in the air are called \nbirds of heaven [*Ps. 8:9]. But since in this body there are many \ndistinct parts, Basil said that there are more heavens than one.\nIn order, then, to understand the distinction of heavens, it must be \nborne in mind that Scripture speaks of heaven in a threefold sense. \nSometimes it uses the word in its proper and natural meaning, when it \ndenotes that body on high which is luminous actually or potentially, and \nincorruptible by nature. In this body there are three heavens; the first \nis the empyrean, which is wholly luminous; the second is the aqueous or \ncrystalline, wholly transparent; and the third is called the starry \nheaven, in part transparent, and in part actually luminous, and divided \ninto eight spheres. One of these is the sphere of the fixed stars; the \nother seven, which may be called the seven heavens, are the spheres of \nthe planets.\nIn the second place, the name heaven is applied to a body that \nparticipates in any property of the heavenly body, as sublimity and \nluminosity, actual or potential. Thus Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii) holds \nas one heaven all the space between the waters and the moon's orb, \ncalling it the aerial. According to him, then, there are three heavens, \nthe aerial, the starry, and one higher than both these, of which the \nApostle is understood to speak when he says of himself that he was \"rapt \nto the third heaven.\"\nBut since this space contains two elements, namely, fire and air, and in \neach of these there is what is called a higher and a lower region Rabanus \nsubdivides this space into four distinct heavens. The higher region of \nfire he calls the fiery heaven; the lower, the Olympian heaven from a \nlofty mountain of that name: the higher region of air he calls, from its \nbrightness, the ethereal heaven; the lower, the aerial. When, therefore, \nthese four heavens are added to the three enumerated above, there are \nseven corporeal heavens in all, in the opinion of Rabanus.\nThirdly, there are metaphorical uses of the word heaven, as when this \nname is applied to the Blessed Trinity, Who is the Light and the Most \nHigh Spirit. It is explained by some, as thus applied,  in the words, \"I \nwill ascend into heaven\"; whereby the evil spirit is represented as \nseeking to make himself equal with God. Sometimes also spiritual \nblessings, the recompense of the Saints, from being the highest of all \ngood gifts, are signified by the word heaven, and, in fact, are so \nsignified, according to Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte), in the words, \n\"Your reward is very great in heaven\" (Mt. 5:12).\nAgain, three kinds of supernatural visions, bodily, imaginative, and \nintellectual, are called sometimes so many heavens, in reference to which \nAugustine (Gen. ad lit. xii) expounds Paul's rapture \"to the third \nheaven.\"",

Again it may be \nsaid with Basil (Hom. iv in Hexaem.), that the earth is mentioned in the \nfirst passage in respect of its nature, but here in respect of its \nprincipal property, namely, dryness. Wherefore it is written: \"He called \nthe dry land, Earth.\" It may also be said with Rabbi Moses, that the \nexpression, \"He called,\" denotes throughout an equivocal use of the name \nimposed. Thus we find it said at first that \"He called the light Day\": \nfor the reason that later on a period of twenty-four hours is also called \nday, where it is said that \"there was evening and morning, one day.\" In \nlike manner it is said that \"the firmament,\" that is, the air, \"He called \nheaven\": for that which was first created was also called \"heaven.\" And \nhere, again, it is said that \"the dry land,\" that is, the part from which \nthe waters had withdrawn, \"He called, Earth,\" as distinct from the sea; \nalthough the name earth is equally applied to that which is covered with \nwaters or not.

        "CON": "The authority of Scripture suffices.",
        "ANS": "It is necessary to reply differently to this question \naccording to the different interpretations given by Augustine and other \nholy writers. In all these works, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, \n15; iv, 22,34; De Gen. Contr. Manich. i, 5, 7), there is no order of \nduration, but only of origin and nature. He says that the formless \nspiritual and formless corporeal natures were created first of all, and \nthat the latter are at first indicated by the words \"earth\" and \"water.\" \nNot that this formlessness preceded formation, in time, but only in \norigin; nor yet that one formation preceded another in duration, but \nmerely in the order of nature. Agreeably, then, to this order, the \nformation of the highest or spiritual nature is recorded in the first \nplace, where it is said that light was made on the first day. For as the \nspiritual nature is higher than the corporeal, so the higher bodies are \nnobler than the lower. Hence the formation of the higher bodies is \nindicated in the second place, by the words, \"Let there be made a \nfirmament,\" by which is to be understood the impression of celestial \nforms on formless matter, that preceded with priority not of time, but of \norigin only. But in the third place the impression of elemental forms on \nformless matter is recorded, also with a priority of origin only. \nTherefore the words, \"Let the waters be gathered together, and the dry \nland appear,\" mean that corporeal matter was impressed with the \nsubstantial form of water, so as to have such movement, and with the \nsubstantial form of earth, so as to have such an appearance.\nAccording, however, to other holy writers [*Question [66], Article [1]] an order of \nduration in the works is to be understood, by which is meant that the \nformlessness of matter precedes its formation, and one form another, in \norder of time. Nevertheless, they do not hold that the formlessness of \nmatter implies the total absence of form, since heaven, earth, and water \nalready existed, since these three are named as already clearly \nperceptible to the senses; rather they understand by formlessness the \nwant of due distinction and of perfect beauty, and in respect of these \nthree Scripture mentions three kinds of formlessness. Heaven, the highest \nof them, was without form so long as \"darkness\" filled it, because it was \nthe source of light. The formlessness of water, which holds the middle \nplace, is called the \"deep,\" because, as Augustine says (Contr. Faust. \nxxii, 11), this word signifies the mass of waters without order. Thirdly, \nthe formless state of the earth is touched upon  when the earth is said \nto be \"void\" or \"invisible,\" because it was covered by the waters. Thus, \nthen, the formation of the highest body took place on the first day. And \nsince time results from the movement of the heaven, and is the numerical \nmeasure of the movement of the highest body, from this formation, \nresulted the distinction of time, namely, that of night and day. On the \nsecond day the intermediate body, water, was formed, receiving from the \nfirmament a sort of distinction and order (so that water be understood as \nincluding certain other things, as explained above (Question [68], Article [3])). On the \nthird day the earth, the lowest body, received its form by the withdrawal \nof the waters, and there resulted the distinction in the lowest body, \nnamely, of land and sea. Hence Scripture, having clearly expresses the \nmanner in which it received its form by the equally suitable words, \"Let \nthe dry land appear.\"",

Hence the \nimpression of such forms is signified by the gathering of the waters, and \nthe appearing of the land. For \"water,\" to use Augustine's words, \"glides \nand flows away, the earth abides\" (Gen. ad lit. ii, 11). Others, again, \nhold that the work of the third day was perfected on that day only as \nregards movement from place to place, and that for this reason Scripture \nhad no reason to speak of it as made.",

Manich. i), because we need not suppose that the \nearth was first covered by the waters, and that these were afterwards \ngathered together, but that they were produced in this very gathering \ntogether. But according to the other writers there are three solutions, \nwhich Augustine gives (Gen. ad lit. i, 12). The first supposes that the \nwaters are heaped up to a greater height at the place where they were \ngathered together, for it has been proved in regard to the Red Sea, that \nthe sea is higher than the land, as Basil remarks (Hom. iv in Hexaem.). \nThe second explains the water that covered the earth as being rarefied or \nnebulous, which was afterwards condensed when the waters were gathered \ntogether. The third suggests the existence of hollows in the earth, to \nreceive the confluence of waters. Of the above the first seems the most \nprobable.",
        "RP3": "All the waters have the sea as their goal, into which they \nflow by channels hidden or apparent, and this may be the reason why they \nare said to be gathered together into one place.

Some philosophers attribute this uncovering of the \nearth's surface to the action of the sun lifting up the vapors and thus \ndrying the land.

Thus, therefore, in either respect this formless \nstate ends on the third day: first, when \"the waters were gathered \ntogether into one place and the dry land appeared\"; secondly, when \"the \nearth brought forth the green herb.\" But concerning the production of \nplants, Augustine's opinion differs from that of others. For other \ncommentators, in accordance with the surface meaning of the text, \nconsider that the plants were produced in act in their various species on \nthis third day; whereas Augustine (Gen. ad lit. v, 5; viii, 3) says that \nthe earth is said to have then produced plants and trees in their causes, \nthat is, it received then the power to produce them. He supports this \nview by the authority of Scripture, for it is said (Gn. 2:4,5): \"These \nare the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, \nin the day that . . . God made the heaven and the earth, and every plant \nof the field before it sprung up in the earth, and every herb of the \nground before it grew.\" Therefore, the production of plants in their \ncauses, within the earth, took place before they sprang up from the \nearth's surface. And this is confirmed by reason, as follows. In these \nfirst days God created all things in their origin or causes, and from \nthis work He subsequently rested. Yet afterwards, by governing His \ncreatures, in the work of propagation, \"He worketh until now.\"Now the \nproduction of plants from out the earth is a work of propagation, and \ntherefore they were not produced in act on the third day, but in their \ncauses only. However, in accordance with other writers, it may be said \nthat the first constitution of species belongs to the work of the six \ndays, but the reproduction among them of like from like, to the \ngovernment of the universe. And Scripture indicates this in the words, \n\"before it sprung up in the earth,\" and \"before it grew,\" that is, before \nlike was produced from like; just as now happens in the natural course by \nthe production of seed. Wherefore Scripture says pointedly (Gn. 1:11): \n\"Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed,\" as \nindicating the production of perfection of perfect species, from which \nthe seed of others should arise.

For \nthe perfection of the heaven and the earth regards, seemingly, those \nthings that belong to them intrinsically, but the adornment, those that \nare extrinsic, just as the perfection of a man lies in his proper parts \nand forms, and his adornment, in clothing or such like. Now just as \ndistinction of certain things is made most evident by their local \nmovement, as separating one from another; so the work of adornment is set \nforth by the production of things having movement in the heavens, and \nupon the earth. But it has been stated above (Question [69], Article [1]), that three \nthings are recorded as created, namely, the heaven, the water, and the \nearth; and these three received their form from the three days' work of \ndistinction, so that heaven was formed on the first day; on the second \nday the waters were separated; and on the third day, the earth was \ndivided into sea and dry land. So also is it in the work of adornment; on \nthe first day of this work, which is the fourth of creation, are produced \nthe lights, to adorn the heaven by their movements; on the second day, \nwhich is the fifth, birds and fishes are called into being, to make \nbeautiful the intermediate element, for they move in air and water, which \nare here taken as one; while on the third day, which is the sixth, \nanimals are brought forth, to move upon the earth and adorn it. It must \nalso here be noted that Augustine's opinion (Gen. ad lit. v, 5) on the \nproduction of lights is not at variance with that of other holy writers, \nsince he says that they were made actually, and not merely virtually, for \nthe firmament has not the power of producing lights, as the earth has of \nproducing plants. Wherefore Scripture does not say: \"Let the firmament \nproduce lights,\" though it says: \"Let the earth bring forth the green \nherb.\"",
        "RP1": "In Augustine's opinion there is no difficulty  here; for he \ndoes not hold a succession of time in these works, and so there was no \nneed for the matter of the lights to exist under another form. Nor is \nthere any difficulty in the opinion of those who hold the heavenly bodies \nto be of the nature of the four elements, for it may be said that they \nwere formed out of matter already existing, as animals and plants were \nformed. For those, however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another \nnature from the elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer must be \nthat the lights were substantially created at the beginning, but that \ntheir substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving \nnot its substantial form, but a determination of power. As to the fact \nthat the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning, but \nonly as made on the fourth day, Chrysostom (Hom. vi in Gen.) explains \nthis by the need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry: \nsince the lights are proved not to be gods, by the fact that they were \nnot from the beginning.",
        "RP2": "No difficulty exists if we follow Augustine in holding the \nlight made on the first day to be spiritual, and that made on this day to \nbe corporeal. If, however, the light made on the first day is understood \nto be itself corporeal, then it must be held to have been produced on \nthat day merely as light in general; and that on the fourth day the \nlights received a definite power to produce determinate effects. Thus we \nobserve that the rays of the sun have one effect, those of the moon \nanother, and so forth. Hence, speaking of such a determination of power, \nDionysius (Div. Nom. iv) says that the sun's light which previously was \nwithout form, was formed on the fourth day.",
        "RP3": "According to Ptolemy the heavenly luminaries are not fixed \nin the spheres, but have their own movement distinct from the movement of \nthe spheres. Wherefore Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Gen.) that He is said \nto have set them in the firmament, not because He fixed them there \nimmovably, but because He bade them to be there, even as He placed man in \nParadise, to be there. In the opinion of Aristotle, however, the stars \nare fixed in their orbits, and in reality have no other movement but that \nof the spheres; and yet our senses perceive the movement of the \nluminaries and not that of the spheres (De Coel. ii, text. 43). But Moses \ndescribes what is obvious to sense, out of condescension to popular \nignorance, as we have already said (Question [67], Article [4]; Question [68], Article [3]). The \nobjection, however, falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made \non the second day as having a natural distinction from that in which the \nstars are placed, even though the distinction is not apparent to the \nsenses, the testimony of which Moses follows, as stated above (De Coel. \nii, text. 43). For although to the senses there appears but one \nfirmament; if we admit a higher and a lower firmament, the lower will be \nthat which was made on the second day, and on the fourth the stars were \nfixed in the higher firmament.",
        "RP4": "In the words of Basil (Hom. v in Hexaem.), plants were \nrecorded as produced before the sun and moon, to prevent idolatry, since \nthose who believe the heavenly bodies to be gods, hold that plants \noriginate primarily from these bodies. Although as  Chrysostom remarks \n(Hom. vi in Gen.), the sun, moon, and stars cooperate in the work of \nproduction by their movements, as the husbandman cooperates by his labor."

Therefore the heavenly bodies are \nliving beings.\nReply to  The heaven is said to move itself in as far as it is \ncompounded of mover and moved; not by the union of the mover, as the \nform, with the moved, as the matter, but by contact with the motive \npower, as we have said.

        "ANS": "Philosophers have differed on this question. Anaxagoras, \nfor instance, as Augustine mentions (De Civ. Dei xviii, 41), \"was \ncondemned by the Athenians for teaching that the sun was a fiery mass of \nstone, and neither a god nor even a living being.\" On the other hand, the \nPlatonists held that the heavenly bodies have life. Nor was there less \ndiversity of opinion among the Doctors of the Church. It was the belief \nof Origen (Peri Archon i) and Jerome that these bodies were alive, and \nthe latter seems to explain in that sense the words (Eccles. 1:6), \"The \nspirit goeth forward, surveying all places round about.\" But Basil (Hom. \niii, vi in Hexaem.) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii) maintain that the \nheavenly bodies are inanimate. Augustine leaves the matter in doubt, \nwithout committing himself to either theory, though he goes so far as to \nsay that if the heavenly bodies are really living beings, their souls \nmust be akin to the angelic nature (Gen. ad lit. ii, 18; Enchiridion \nlviii).\nIn examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of opinion \nexists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body \nexists for the sake of the soul and not of the  body; for the form does \nnot exist for the matter, but the matter for the form. Now the nature and \npower of the soul are apprehended through its operation, which is to a \ncertain extent its end. Yet for some of these operations, as sensation \nand nutrition, our body is a necessary instrument. Hence it is clear that \nthe sensitive and nutritive souls must be united to a body in order to \nexercise their functions. There are, however, operations of the soul, \nwhich are not exercised through the medium of the body, though the body \nministers, as it were, to their production. The intellect, for example, \nmakes use of the phantasms derived from the bodily senses, and thus far \nis dependent on the body, although capable of existing apart from it. It \nis not, however, possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and \ngeneration, through which the nutritive soul operates, can be exercised \nby the heavenly bodies, for such operations are incompatible with a body \nnaturally incorruptible. Equally impossible is it that the functions of \nthe sensitive soul can appertain to the heavenly body, since all the \nsenses depend on the sense of touch, which perceives elemental qualities, \nand all the organs of the senses require a certain proportion in the \nadmixture of elements, whereas the nature of the heavenly bodies is not \nelemental. It follows, then, that of the operations of the soul the only \nones left to be attributed to the heavenly bodies are those of \nunderstanding and moving; for appetite follows both sensitive and \nintellectual perception, and is in proportion thereto. But the operations \nof the intellect, which does not act through the body, do not need a body \nas their instrument, except to supply phantasms through the senses. \nMoreover, the operations of the sensitive soul, as we have seen, cannot \nbe attributed to the heavenly bodies. Accordingly, the union of a soul to \na heavenly body cannot be for the purpose of the operations of the \nintellect. It remains, then, only to consider whether the movement of the \nheavenly bodies demands a soul as the motive power, not that the soul, in \norder to move the heavenly body, need be united to the latter as its \nform; but by contact of power, as a mover is united to that which he \nmoves. Wherefore Aristotle (Phys. viii, text. 42,43), after showing that \nthe first mover is made up of two parts, the moving and the moved, goes \non to show the nature of the union between these two parts. This, he \nsays, is effected by contact which is mutual if both are bodies; on the \npart of one only, if one is a body and the other not. The Platonists \nexplain the union of soul and body in the same way, as a contact of a \nmoving power with the object moved, and since Plato holds the heavenly \nbodies to be living beings, this means nothing else but that substances \nof spiritual nature are united to them, and act as their moving power. A \nproof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the direct influence and \ncontact of some spiritual substance, and not, like bodies of specific \ngravity, by nature, lies in the fact that whereas nature moves to one \nfixed end which having attained, it rests; this does not appear in the \nmovement of heavenly bodies. Hence it follows that they are moved by some \nintellectual substances. Augustine appears to be of the same opinion when \nhe expresses his belief that all corporeal things are ruled by God \nthrough the spirit of life (De Trin. iii, 4).\nFrom what has been said, then, it is clear that the heavenly bodies are \nnot living beings in the same sense as plants and animals, and that if \nthey are called so, it can only be equivocally. It will also be seen that \nthe difference of opinion between those who affirm, and those who deny, \nthat these bodies have life, is not a difference of things but of words.",

While, then, it is not conceded that the souls of \nheavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals absolutely it must \nbe conceded that they are superior to them with regard to their \nrespective forms, since their form perfects their matter entirely, which \nis not in potentiality to other forms; whereas a soul does not do this. \nAlso as regards movement the power that moves the heavenly bodies is of a \nnobler kind.",
        "RP3": "Since the heavenly body is a mover moved, it is of the \nnature of an instrument, which acts in virtue of the agent: and therefore \nsince this agent is a living substance the heavenly body can impart life \nin virtue of that agent.",

But as on the seventh day nothing was instituted, that day ought \nnot to be enumerated with the others.\nReply to  According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 15), after all \nthat has been recorded that is assigned to the six days, something \ndistinct is attributed to the seventh---namely, that on it God rested in \nHimself from His works: and for this reason it was right that the seventh \nday should be mentioned after the six. It may also be said, with the \nother writers, that the world entered on the seventh day upon a new \nstate, in that nothing new was to be added to it, and that therefore the \nseventh day is mentioned after the six, from its being devoted to \ncessation from work.",
        "ANS": "The reason of the distinction of these days is made clear \nby what has been said above (Question [70], Article [1]), namely, that the parts of the \nworld had first to be distinguished, and then each part adorned and \nfilled, as it were, by the beings that inhabit it. Now the parts into \nwhich the corporeal creation is divided are three, according to some holy \nwriters, these parts being the heaven, or highest part, the water, or \nmiddle part, and the earth, or the lowest part. Thus the Pythagoreans \nteach that perfection consists in three things, the beginning, the \nmiddle, and the end. The first part, then, is distinguished on the first \nday, and adorned on the fourth, the middle part distinguished on the \nmiddle day, and adorned on the fifth, and the third part distinguished on \nthe third day, and adorned on the sixth. But Augustine, while agreeing \nwith the above writers as to the last three days, differs as to the first \nthree, for, according to him, spiritual creatures are formed on the first \nday, and corporeal on the two others, the higher bodies being formed on \nthe first these two days, and the lower on the second. Thus, then, the \nperfection of the Divine works corresponds to the perfection of the \nnumber six, which is the sum of its aliquot parts, one, two, three; since \none day is assigned to the forming of spiritual creatures, two to that of \ncorporeal creatures, and three to the work of adornment.",
        "RP1": "According to Augustine, the work of creation belongs to the \nproduction of formless matter, and of the formless spiritual nature, both \nof which are outside of time, as he himself says (Confess. xii, 12). \nThus, then, the creation of either is set down before there was any day. \nBut it may also be said, following other holy writers, that the works of \ndistinction and adornment imply certain changes in the creature which are \nmeasurable by time; whereas the work of creation lies only in the Divine \nact producing the substance of beings instantaneously. For this reason,  \ntherefore, every work of distinction and adornment is said to take place \n\"in a day,\" but creation \"in the beginning\" which denotes something \nindivisible.",

        "ANS": "On this question Augustine differs from other expositors. \nHis opinion is that all the days that are called seven, are one day \nrepresented in a sevenfold aspect (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22; De Civ. Dei xi, \n9; Ad Orosium xxvi); while others consider there were seven distinct \ndays, not one only. Now, these two opinions, taken as explaining the \nliteral text of Genesis, are certainly widely different. For Augustine \nunderstands by the word \"day,\" the knowledge in the mind of the angels, \nand hence, according to him, the first day denotes their knowledge of the \nfirst of the Divine works, the second day their knowledge of the second \nwork, and similarly with the rest. Thus, then, each work is said to have \nbeen wrought in some one of these days, inasmuch as God wrought in some \none of these days, inasmuch as God wrought nothing in the universe \nwithout impressing the knowledge thereof on the angelic mind; which can \nknow many things at the same time, especially in the Word, in Whom all \nangelic knowledge is perfected and terminated. So the distinction of days \ndenotes the natural order of the things known, and not a succession in \nthe knowledge acquired, or in the things produced. Moreover, angelic \nknowledge is appropriately called \"day,\" since light, the cause of day, \nis to be found in spiritual things, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. \niv, 28). In the opinion of the others, however, the days signify a \nsuccession both in time, and in the things produced.\nIf, however, these two explanations are looked at as referring to the \nmode of production, they will be found not greatly to differ, if the \ndiversity of opinion existing on two points, as already shown (Question [67], Article [1]; Question [69], Article [1]), between Augustine and other writers is taken into \naccount. First, because Augustine takes the earth and the water as first \ncreated, to signify matter totally without form; but the making of the \nfirmament, the gathering of the waters, and the appearing of dry land, to \ndenote the impression of forms upon corporeal matter. But other holy \nwriters take the earth and the water, as first created, to signify the \nelements of the universe themselves existing under the proper forms, and \nthe works that follow to mean some sort of distinction in bodies \npreviously existing, as also has been shown (Question [67], Articles [1],4; Question [69], Article [1]). Secondly, some writers hold that plants and animals were produced \nactually in the work of the six days; Augustine, that they were produced  \npotentially. Now the opinion of Augustine, that the works of the six days \nwere simultaneous, is consistent with either view of the mode of \nproduction. For the other writers agree with him that in the first \nproduction of things matter existed under the substantial form of the \nelements, and agree with him also that in the first instituting of the \nworld animals and plants did not exist actually. There remains, however, \na difference as to four points; since, according to the latter, there was \na time, after the production of creatures, in which light did not exist, \nthe firmament had not been formed, and the earth was still covered by the \nwaters, nor had the heavenly bodies been formed, which is the fourth \ndifference; which are not consistent with Augustine's explanation. In \norder, therefore, to be impartial, we must meet the arguments of either \nside.",
        "RP1": "On the day on which God created the heaven and the earth, \nHe created also every plant of the field, not, indeed, actually, but \n\"before it sprung up in the earth,\" that is, potentially.

        "RP2": "God created all things together so far as regards their \nsubstance in some measure formless. But He did not create all things \ntogether, so far as regards that formation of things which lies in \ndistinction and adornment. Hence the word \"creation\" is significant.",

Therefore in the \ncreation of heaven and earth, as in the other works, mention should have \nbeen made of the Word of God.",

Therefore \nto the words, \"God said: Let the firmament be made . . . and it was so,\" \nit is superfluous to add, \"God made the firmament.\" And the like is to be \nsaid of other works.\nObjection 6: Further, evening and morning do not sufficiently divide the day, \nsince the day has many parts. Therefore the words, \"The evening and \nmorning were the second day\" or, \"the third day,\" are not suitable.\nObjection 7: Further, \"first,\" not \"one,\" corresponds to \"second\" and \"third.\" \nIt should therefore have been said that, \"The evening and the morning \nwere the first day,\" rather than \"one day.\"\nReply to  According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 8), these three \nphrases denote the threefold being of creatures; first, their being in \nthe Word, denoted by the command \"Let . . . be made\"; secondly, their \nbeing in the angelic mind, signified by the words, \"It was . . . done\"; \nthirdly, their being in their proper nature, by the words, \"He made.\" And \nbecause the formation of the angels is recorded on the first day, it was \nnot necessary there to add, \"He made.\" It may also be said, following \nother writers, that the words, \"He said,\" and \"Let . . . be made,\" denote \nGod's command, and the words, \"It was done,\" the fulfilment of that \ncommand. But as it was necessary, for the sake of those especially who \nhave asserted that all visible things were made by the angels, to mention \nhow things were made, it is added, in order to remove that error, that \nGod Himself made them. Hence, in each work, after the words, \"It was \ndone,\" some act of God is expressed by some such words as, \"He made,\" or, \n\"He divided,\" or, \"He called.\"\nReply to Objection 6: According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22,30), by the \n\"evening\" and the \"morning\" are understood the evening and the morning \nknowledge of the angels, which has been explained (Question [58], Article [6],7). But, \naccording to Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.), the entire period takes its \nname, as is customary, from its more important part, the day. And \ninstance of this is found in the words of Jacob, \"The days of my \npilgrimage,\" where night is not mentioned at all. But the evening and the \nmorning are mentioned as being the ends of the day, since day begins with \nmorning and ends with evening, or because evening denotes the beginning \nof night, and morning the beginning of day. It seems fitting, also, that \nwhere the first distinction of creatures is described, divisions of time \nshould be denoted only by what marks their beginning. And the reason for \nmentioning the evening first is that as the evening ends the day, which \nbegins with the light, the termination of the light at evening precedes \nthe termination of the darkness, which ends with the morning. But \nChrysostom's explanation is that thereby it is intended to show that the \nnatural day does not end with the evening, but with the morning (Hom. v \nin Gen.).\nReply to Objection 7: The words \"one day\" are used when day is first instituted, \nto denote that one day is made up of twenty-four hours. Hence, by \nmentioning \"one,\" the measure of a natural day is fixed. Another reason \nmay be to signify that a day is completed by the return of the sun to the \npoint from which it commenced its course. And yet another, because at the \ncompletion of a week of seven days,  the first day returns which is one \nwith the eighth day. The three reasons assigned above are those given by \nBasil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.).",
        "RP1": "According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 4), the person of \nthe Son is mentioned both in the first creation of the world, and in its \ndistinction and adornment, but differently in either place. For \ndistinction and adornment belong to the work by which the world receives \nits form. But as the giving form to a work of art is by means of the form \nof the art in the mind of the artist, which may be called his \nintelligible word, so the giving form to every creature is by the word of \nGod; and for this reason in the works of distinction and adornment the \nWord is mentioned. But in creation the Son is mentioned as the beginning, \nby the words, \"In the beginning God created,\" since by creation is \nunderstood the production of formless matter. But according to those who \nhold that the elements were created from the first under their proper \nforms, another explanation must be given; and therefore Basil says (Hom. \nii, iii in Hexaem.) that the words, \"God said,\" signify a Divine command. \nSuch a command, however, could not have been given before creatures had \nbeen produced that could obey it.",
        "RP2": "According to Augustine (De Civ. Dei ix, 33), by the heaven \nis understood the formless spiritual nature, and by the earth, the \nformless matter of all corporeal things, and thus no creature is omitted. \nBut, according to Basil (Hom. i in Hexaem.), the heaven and the earth, as \nthe two extremes, are alone mentioned, the intervening things being left \nto be understood, since all these move heavenwards, if light, or \nearthwards, if heavy. And others say that under the word, \"earth,\" \nScripture is accustomed to include  all the four elements as (Ps. 148:7,8) after the words, \"Praise the Lord from the earth,\" is added, \n\"fire, hail, snow, and ice.\"",
        "RP3": "In the account of the creation there is found something to \ncorrespond to the words, \"God saw that it was good,\" used in the work of \ndistinction and adornment, and this appears from the consideration that \nthe Holy Spirit is Love. Now, \"there are two things,\" says Augustine \n(Gen. ad lit. i, 8) which came from God's love of His creatures, their \nexistence and their permanence. That they might then exist, and exist \npermanently, \"the Spirit of God,\" it is said, \"moved over the \nwaters\"---that is to say, over that formless matter, signified by water, \neven as the love of the artist moves over the materials of his art, that \nout of them he may form his work. And the words, \"God saw that it was \ngood,\" signify that the things that He had made were to endure, since \nthey express a certain satisfaction taken by God in His works, as of an \nartist in his art: not as though He knew the creature otherwise, or that \nthe creature was pleasing to Him otherwise, than before He made it. Thus \nin either work, of creation and of formation, the Trinity of Persons is \nimplied. In creation the Person of the Father is indicated by God the \nCreator, the Person of the Son by the beginning, in which He created, and \nthe Person of the Holy Ghost by the Spirit that moved over the waters. \nBut in the formation, the Person of the Father is indicated by God that \nspeaks, and the Person of the Son by the Word in which He speaks, and the \nPerson of the Holy Spirit by the satisfaction with which God saw that \nwhat was made was good. And if the words, \"God saw that it was good,\" are \nnot said of the work of the second day, this is because the work of \ndistinguishing the waters was only begun on that day, but perfected on \nthe third. Hence these words, that are said of the third day, refer also \nto the second. Or it may be that Scripture does not use these words of \napproval of the second days' work, because this is concerned with the \ndistinction of things not evident to the senses of mankind. Or, again, \nbecause by the firmament is simply understood the cloudy region of the \nair, which is not one of the permanent parts of the universe, nor of the \nprincipal divisions of the world. The above three reasons are given by \nRabbi Moses [*Perplex. ii.], and to these may be added a mystical one \nderived from numbers and assigned by some writers, according to whom the \nwork of the second day is not marked with approval because the second \nnumber is an imperfect number, as receding from the perfection of unity.",
        "RP4": "Rabbi Moses (Perplex. ii) understands by the \"Spirit of the \nLord,\" the air or the wind, as Plato also did, and says that it is so \ncalled according to the custom of Scripture, in which these things are \nthroughout attributed to God. But according to the holy writers, the \nSpirit of the Lord signifies the Holy Ghost, Who is said to \"move over \nthe water\"---that is to say, over what Augustine holds to mean formless \nmatter, lest it should be supposed that God loved of necessity the works \nHe was to produce, as though He stood in need of them. For love of that \nkind is subject to, not superior to, the object of love. Moreover, it is \nfittingly implied that the Spirit moved over that which was  incomplete \nand unfinished, since that movement is not one of place, but of \npre-eminent power, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. i, 7). It is the \nopinion, however, of Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) that the Spirit moved \nover the element of water, \"fostering and quickening its nature and \nimpressing vital power, as the hen broods over her chickens.\" For water \nhas especially a life-giving power, since many animals are generated in \nwater, and the seed of all animals is liquid. Also the life of the soul \nis given by the water of baptism, according to Jn. 3:5: \"Unless a man be \nborn again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom \nof God.\""

Therefore the soul is a mover \nmoved. But every mover moved is a body. Therefore the soul is a body.",

        "ANS": "To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise that the \nsoul is defined as the first principle of life of those things which \nlive: for we call living things \"animate,\" [*i.e. having a soul], and \nthose things which have no life, \"inanimate.\" Now life is shown \nprincipally by two actions, knowledge and movement. The philosophers of \nold, not being able to rise above their imagination, supposed that the \nprinciple of these actions was something corporeal: for they asserted \nthat only bodies were real things; and that what is not corporeal is \nnothing: hence they maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This \nopinion can be proved to be false in many ways; but we shall make use of \nonly one proof, based on universal and certain principles, which shows \nclearly that the soul is not a body.\nIt is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a soul, for \nthen the eye would be a soul, as it is a principle of vision; and the \nsame might be applied to the other instruments of the soul: but it is the \n\"first\" principle of life, which we call the soul. Now, though a body may \nbe a principle of life, or to be a living thing, as the heart is a \nprinciple of life in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first \nprinciple of life. For it is clear that to be a principle of life, or to \nbe a living thing, does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were \nthe case, every body would be a living thing, or a principle of life. \nTherefore a body is competent to be a living thing or even a principle of \nlife, as \"such\" a body. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to \nsome principle which is called its act. Therefore the soul, which is the \nfirst principle of life, is not a body, but the act of a body; thus heat, \nwhich is the principle of calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a \nbody.",

But, as is shown in Phys. \nviii, 6, there is a mover which is altogether immovable, and not moved \neither essentially, or accidentally; and such a mover can cause an \ninvariable movement. There is, however, another kind of mover, which, \nthough not moved essentially, is moved accidentally; and for this reason \nit does not cause an invariable movement; such a mover, is the soul. \nThere is, again, another mover, which is moved essentially---namely, the \nbody.

Hence it \nis necessary, not that the likeness of corporeal things should be \nactually in the nature of the soul, but that there be a potentiality in \nthe soul for such a likeness.

In this sense, the eye or the hand \ncannot be said to subsist \"per se\"; nor can it for that reason be said to \noperate \"per se.\" Hence the operation of the parts is through each part \nattributed to the whole.

I say this, \nforasmuch as some held that the form alone belongs to the species; while \nmatter is part of the individual, and not the species. This cannot be \ntrue; for to the nature of the species belongs what the definition \nsignifies; and in natural things the definition does not signify the form \nonly, but the form and the matter.

Now, either it is a form \nby virtue of itself, in its entirety, or by virtue of some part of \nitself. If by virtue of itself in its entirety, then it is impossible \nthat any part of it should be matter, if by matter we understand \nsomething purely potential: for a form, as such, is an act; and that \nwhich is purely potentiality cannot be part of an act, since potentiality \nis repugnant to actuality as being opposite thereto. If, however, it be a \nform by virtue of a part of itself, then we call that part the soul: and \nthat matter, which it actualizes first, we call the \"primary animate.\"\nSecondly, we may proceed from the specific notion of the human soul \ninasmuch as it is intellectual. For it is clear that whatever is received \ninto something is received according to the condition of the recipient. \nNow a thing is known in as far as its form is in the knower. But the \nintellectual soul knows a thing in its nature absolutely: for instance, \nit knows a stone absolutely as a stone; and therefore the form of a stone \nabsolutely, as to its proper formal idea, is in the intellectual soul. \nTherefore the intellectual soul itself is an absolute form, and not \nsomething composed of matter and form. For if the intellectual soul were \ncomposed of matter and form, the forms of things would be received into \nit as individuals, and so it would only know the individual: just as it \nhappens with the sensitive powers which receive forms in a corporeal \norgan; since matter is the principle by which forms are individualized. \nIt follows, therefore, that the intellectual soul, and every intellectual \nsubstance which has knowledge of forms absolutely, is exempt from \ncomposition of matter and form.",

But \nthe acts received which proceed from the First Infinite Act, and are \nparticipations thereof, are diverse, so that there  cannot be one \npotentiality which receives all acts, as there is one act, from which all \nparticipated acts are derived; for then the receptive potentiality would \nequal the active potentiality of the First Act. Now the receptive \npotentiality in the intellectual soul is other than the receptive \npotentiality of first matter, as appears from the diversity of the things \nreceived by each. For primary matter receives individual forms; whereas \nthe intelligence receives absolute forms. Hence the existence of such a \npotentiality in the intellectual soul does not prove that the soul is \ncomposed of matter and form.",

As, therefore, the potentiality of \nthe intelligence is one thing and the potentiality of primary matter \nanother, so in each is there a different reason of subjection and change. \nFor the intelligence is subject to knowledge, and is changed from \nignorance to knowledge, by reason of its being in potentiality with \nregard to the intelligible species.",

So after the words quoted above, \nthe Philosopher concludes, that in things composed of matter and form \n\"there is no other cause but that which moves from potentiality to act; \nwhile whatsoever things have no matter are simply beings at once.\" [*The \nLeonine edition has, \"simpliciter sunt quod vere entia aliquid.\" The \nParma edition of St. Thomas's Commentary on Aristotle has, \"statim per se \nunum quiddam est . . . et ens quiddam.\"]",

For generation and corruption belong to a \nthing, just as existence belongs to it, which is acquired by generation \nand lost by corruption. Therefore, whatever has existence \"per se\" cannot \nbe generated or corrupted except 'per se'; while things which do not \nsubsist, such as accidents and material forms, acquire existence or lost \nit through the generation or corruption of composite things. Now it was \nshown above (Articles [2],3) that the souls of brutes are not self-subsistent, \nwhereas the human soul is; so that the souls of brutes are corrupted, \nwhen their bodies are corrupted; while the human soul could not be \ncorrupted unless it were corrupted \"per se.\" This, indeed, is impossible, \nnot only as regards the human soul, but also as regards anything \nsubsistent that is a form alone. For it is clear that what belongs to a \nthing by virtue of itself is inseparable from it; but existence belongs \nto a form, which is an act, by virtue of itself.

For corruption is found only where there is contrariety; \nsince generation and corruption are from contraries and into contraries. \nWherefore the heavenly bodies, since they have no matter subject to \ncontrariety, are incorruptible. Now there can  be no contrariety in the \nintellectual soul; for it receives according to the manner of its \nexistence, and those things which it receives are without contrariety; \nfor the notions even of contraries are not themselves contrary, since \ncontraries belong to the same knowledge. Therefore it is impossible for \nthe intellectual soul to be corruptible. Moreover we may take a sign of \nthis from the fact that everything naturally aspires to existence after \nits own manner. Now, in things that have knowledge, desire ensues upon \nknowledge. The senses indeed do not know existence, except under the \nconditions of \"here\" and \"now,\" whereas the intellect apprehends \nexistence absolutely, and for all time; so that everything that has an \nintellect naturally desires always to exist.

        "CON": "According to the Philosopher, Metaph. viii (Did. vii \n2), difference is derived from the form. But the difference which \nconstitutes man is \"rational,\" which is applied to man on account of his \nintellectual principle. Therefore the intellectual principle is the form \nof man.",
        "ANS": "We must assert that the intellect which is the principle \nof intellectual operation is the form of the human body. For that whereby \nprimarily anything acts is a form of the thing to  which the act is to be \nattributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is \nhealth, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence \nhealth is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul. The \nreason is because nothing acts except so far as it is in act; wherefore a \nthing acts by that whereby it is in act. Now it is clear that the first \nthing by which the body lives is the soul. And as life appears through \nvarious operations in different degrees of living things, that whereby we \nprimarily perform each of all these vital actions is the soul. For the \nsoul is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local \nmovement; and likewise of our understanding. Therefore this principle by \nwhich we primarily understand, whether it be called the intellect or the \nintellectual soul, is the form of the body. This is the demonstration \nused by Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2).\nBut if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the \nbody he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is \nthe action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it is \nhimself who understands. Now an action may be attributed to anyone in \nthree ways, as is clear from the Philosopher (Phys. v, 1); for a thing is \nsaid to move or act, either by virtue of its whole self, for instance, as \na physician heals; or by virtue of a part, as a man sees by his eye; or \nthrough an accidental quality, as when we say that something that is \nwhite builds, because it is accidental to the builder to be white. So \nwhen we say that Socrates or Plato understands, it is clear that this is \nnot attributed to him accidentally; since it is ascribed to him as man, \nwhich is predicated of him essentially. We must therefore say either that \nSocrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as Plato maintained, \nholding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part \nof Socrates. The first cannot stand, as was shown above (Question [75], Article [4]), \nfor this reason, that it is one and the same man who is conscious both \nthat he understands, and that he senses. But one cannot sense without a \nbody: therefore the body must be some part of man. It follows therefore \nthat the intellect by which Socrates understands is a part of Socrates, \nso that in some way it is united to the body of Socrates.\nThe Commentator held that this union is through the intelligible \nspecies, as having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and in \nthe phantasms which are in the corporeal organs. Thus through the \nintelligible species the possible intellect is linked to the body of this \nor that particular man. But this link or union does not sufficiently \nexplain the fact, that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates. \nThis can be clearly seen from comparison with the sensitive faculty, from \nwhich Aristotle proceeds to consider things relating to the intellect. \nFor the relation of phantasms to the intellect is like the relation of \ncolors to the sense of sight, as he says De Anima iii, 5,7. Therefore, as \nthe species of colors are in the sight, so are the species of phantasms \nin the possible intellect. Now it is clear that because the colors, the \nimages of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is \nnot attributed to the wall: for  we do not say that the wall sees, but \nrather that it is seen. Therefore, from the fact that the species of \nphantasms are in the possible intellect, it does not follow that \nSocrates, in whom are the phantasms, understands, but that he or his \nphantasms are understood.\nSome, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the \nbody as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing \nso that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole. This \nis, however, absurd for many reasons. First, because the intellect does \nnot move the body except through the appetite, the movement of which \npresupposes the operation of the intellect. The reason therefore why \nSocrates understands is not because he is moved by his intellect, but \nrather, contrariwise, he is moved by his intellect because he \nunderstands. Secondly, because since Socrates is an individual in a \nnature of one essence composed of matter and form, if the intellect be \nnot the form, it follows that it must be outside the essence, and then \nthe intellect is the whole Socrates as a motor to the thing moved. \nWhereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, and does not pass into \nsomething else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of \nunderstanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is \nmoved by his intellect. Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never \nattributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as the action \nof a carpenter to a saw. Therefore if understanding is attributed to \nSocrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is \nattributed to him as to an instrument. This is contrary to the teaching \nof the Philosopher, who holds that understanding is not possible through \na corporeal instrument (De Anima iii, 4). Fourthly, because, although the \naction of a part be attributed to the whole, as the action of the eye is \nattributed to a man; yet it is never attributed to another part, except \nperhaps indirectly; for we do not say that the hand sees because the eye \nsees. Therefore if the intellect and Socrates are united in the above \nmanner, the action of the intellect cannot be attributed to Socrates. If, \nhowever, Socrates be a whole composed of a union of the intellect with \nwhatever else belongs to Socrates, and still the intellect be united to \nthose other things only as a motor, it follows that Socrates is not one \nabsolutely, and consequently neither a being absolutely, for a thing is a \nbeing according as it is one.\nThere remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by \nAristotle---namely, that this particular man understands, because the \nintellectual principle is his form. Thus from the very operation of the \nintellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to \nthe body as its form.\nThe same can be clearly shown from the nature of the human species. For \nthe nature of each thing is shown by its operation. Now the proper \noperation of man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpasses \nall other animals. Whence Aristotle concludes (Ethic. x, 7) that the \nultimate happiness of man must consist in this operation as properly \nbelonging to him. Man must therefore  derive his species from that which \nis the principle of this operation. But the species of anything is \nderived from its form. It follows therefore that the intellectual \nprinciple is the proper form of man.\nBut we must observe that the nobler a form is, the more it rises above \ncorporeal matter, the less it is merged in matter, and the more it excels \nmatter by its power and its operation; hence we find that the form of a \nmixed body has another operation not caused by its elemental qualities. \nAnd the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that \nthe power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative \nsoul excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the \nvegetative soul. Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms. \nWherefore it excels corporeal matter in its power by the fact that it has \nan operation and a power in which corporeal matter has no share whatever. \nThis power is called the intellect.\nIt is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of \nmatter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the \nform of the body. For since the form is an act, and matter is only in \npotentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot be the \nform of another by virtue of itself as a whole. But if it is a form by \nvirtue of some part of itself, then that part which is the form we call \nthe soul, and that of which it is the form we call the \"primary animate,\" \nas was said above (Question [75], Article [5]).",
        "RP1": "As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 2), the ultimate natural \nform to which the consideration of the natural philosopher is directed is \nindeed separate; yet it exists in matter. He proves this from the fact \nthat \"man and the sun generate man from matter.\" It is separate indeed \naccording to its intellectual power, because the intellectual power does \nnot belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is the act of the \neye; for understanding is an act which cannot be performed by a corporeal \norgan, like the act of seeing. But it exists in matter so far as the soul \nitself, to which this power belongs, is the form of the body, and the \nterm of human generation. And so the Philosopher says (De Anima iii) that \nthe intellect is separate, because it is not the faculty of a corporeal \norgan.\nFrom this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: \nsince, in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of \nhis intellect, and that his intellect may understand immaterial things \nand universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the \nact of the body.",

        "ANS": "It is absolutely impossible for one intellect to belong \nto all men. This is clear if, as Plato maintained, man is the intellect \nitself. For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man; and that \nthey are not distinct from each other, except by something outside the \nessence of each. The distinction between Socrates and Plato would be no \nother than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; which \nis quite absurd.\nIt is likewise clear that this is impossible if, according to the \nopinion of Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), it is supposed that the intellect \nis a part or a power of the soul which is the form of man. For it is \nimpossible for many distinct individuals to have one form, as it is \nimpossible for them to have one existence, for the form is the principle \nof existence.\nAgain, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the \nmanner of the union of the intellect to this or that man. For it is \nmanifest that, supposing there is one principal agent, and two \ninstruments, we can say that there is one agent absolutely, but several \nactions; as when one man touches several things with his two hands, there \nwill be one who touches, but two contacts. If, on the contrary, we \nsuppose one instrument and several principal agents, we might say that \nthere are several agents, but one act; for example, if there be many \ndrawing a ship by means of a rope; there will be many drawing, but one \npull. If, however, there is one principal agent, and one instrument, we \nsay that there is one agent and one action, as when the smith strikes \nwith one hammer, there is one striker and one stroke. Now it is clear \nthat no matter how the intellect is united or coupled to this or that \nman, the intellect  has the precedence of all the other things which \nappertain to man; for the sensitive powers obey the intellect, and are at \nits service. Therefore, if we suppose two men to have several intellects \nand one sense---for instance, if two men had one eye---there would be \nseveral seers, but one sight. But if there is one intellect, no matter \nhow diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as \ninstruments, in no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Plato are \notherwise than one understanding man. And if to this we add that to \nunderstand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any \norgan other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there \nis but one agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one \n\"understander,\" and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that \nis, of one intelligible object.\nHowever, it would be possible to distinguish my intellectual action form \nyours by the distinction of the phantasms---that is to say, were there \none phantasm of a stone in me, and another in you---if the phantasm \nitself, as it is one thing in me and another in you, were a form of the \npossible intellect; since the same agent according to divers forms \nproduces divers actions; as, according to divers forms of things with \nregard to the same eye, there are divers visions. But the phantasm itself \nis not a form of the possible intellect; it is the intelligible species \nabstracted from the phantasm that is a form. Now in one intellect, from \ndifferent phantasms of the same species, only one intelligible species is \nabstracted; as appears in one man, in whom there may be different \nphantasms of a stone; yet from all of them only one intelligible species \nof a stone is abstracted; by which the intellect of that one man, by one \noperation, understands the nature of a stone, notwithstanding the \ndiversity of phantasms. Therefore, if there were one intellect for all \nmen, the diversity of phantasms which are in this one and that one would \nnot cause a diversity of intellectual operation in this man and that man. \nIt follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and unreasonable \nto maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.",

But if the species be abstracted from the \nconditions of individual matter, there will be a likeness of the nature \nwithout those things which make it distinct and multiplied; thus there \nwill be knowledge of the universal.

In the \nsame way several intellects understand one object understood. But there \nis this difference, according to the opinion of Aristotle, between the \nsense and the intelligence---that a thing is perceived by the sense \naccording to the disposition which it has outside the soul ---that is, in \nits individuality; whereas the nature of the thing understood is indeed \noutside the soul, but the mode according to which it exists outside the \nsoul is not the mode according to which it is understood. For the common \nnature is understood as apart from the individuating principles; whereas \nsuch is not its mode of existence outside the soul.

        "ANS": "Plato held that there were several souls in one body, \ndistinct even as to organs, to which souls he referred the different \nvital actions, saying that the nutritive power is in the liver, the \nconcupiscible in the heart, and the power of knowledge in the brain. \nWhich opinion is rejected by Aristotle (De Anima ii, 2), with regard to \nthose parts of the soul which use corporeal organs; for this reason, that \nin those animals which continue to live when they have been divided in \neach part are observed the operations of the soul, as sense and appetite. \nNow this would not  be the case if the various principles of the soul's \noperations were essentially different, and distributed in the various \nparts of the body. But with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to \nleave it in doubt whether it be \"only logically\" distinct from the other \nparts of the soul, \"or also locally.\"\nThe opinion of Plato might be maintained if, as he held, the soul was \nsupposed to be united to the body, not as its form, but as its motor. For \nit involves nothing unreasonable that the same movable thing be moved by \nseveral motors; and still less if it be moved according to its various \nparts. If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the body as its \nform, it is quite impossible for several essentially different souls to \nbe in one body. This can be made clear by three different reasons.\nIn the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which \nthere were several souls. For nothing is absolutely one except by one \nform, by which a thing has existence: because a thing has from the same \nsource both existence and unity; and therefore things which are \ndenominated by various forms are not absolutely one; as, for instance, \"a \nwhite man.\" If, therefore, man were 'living' by one form, the vegetative \nsoul, and 'animal' by another form, the sensitive soul, and \"man\" by \nanother form, the intellectual soul, it would follow that man is not \nabsolutely one. Thus Aristotle argues, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6), \nagainst Plato, that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the idea of \na biped, then a biped animal is not absolutely one. For this reason, \nagainst those who hold that there are several souls in the body, he asks \n(De Anima i, 5), \"what contains them?\"---that is, what makes them one? It \ncannot be said that they are united by the one body; because rather does \nthe soul contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.\nSecondly, this is proved to be impossible by the manner in which one \nthing is predicated of another. Those things which are derived from \nvarious forms are predicated of one another, either accidentally, (if the \nforms are not ordered to one another, as when we say that something white \nis sweet), or essentially, in the second manner of essential predication, \n(if the forms are ordered one to another, the subject belonging to the \ndefinition of the predicate; as a surface is presupposed to color; so \nthat if we say that a body with a surface is colored, we have the second \nmanner of essential predication.) Therefore, if we have one form by which \na thing is an animal, and another form by which it is a man, it follows \neither that one of these two things could not be predicated of the other, \nexcept accidentally, supposing these two forms not to be ordered to one \nanother---or that one would be predicated of the other according to the \nsecond manner of essential predication, if one soul be presupposed to the \nother. But both of these consequences are clearly false: because \"animal\" \nis predicated of man essentially and not accidentally; and man is not \npart of the definition of an animal, but the other way about. Therefore \nof necessity by the same form a thing is animal and man; otherwise man \nwould not really be the thing which is an animal, so that animal  can be \nessentially predicated of man.\nThirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one \noperation of the soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be \nthe case unless the principle of action were essentially one.\nWe must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the \nintellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This \ncan easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species and \nforms. For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from \none another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the \nanimate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect \nthan plants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera \nthere are various degrees. For this reason Aristotle, Metaph. viii (Did. \nvii, 3), compares the species of things to numbers, which differ in \nspecies by the addition or subtraction of unity. And (De Anima ii, 3) he \ncompares the various souls to the species of figures, one of which \ncontains another; as a pentagon contains and exceeds a tetragon. Thus the \nintellectual soul contains virtually whatever belongs to the sensitive \nsoul of brute animals, and to the nutritive souls of plants. Therefore, \nas a surface which is of a pentagonal shape, is not tetragonal by one \nshape, and pentagonal by another---since a tetragonal shape would be \nsuperfluous as contained in the pentagonal---so neither is Socrates a man \nby one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same soul he is \nboth animal and man.",

For \nalthough sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot \ndeprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.",

If, however, the intellectual soul be united to the body as its \nsubstantial form, as we have said above (Article [1]), it is impossible for \nanother substantial form besides  the intellectual soul to be found in \nman.\nIn order to make this evident, we must consider that the substantial \nform differs from the accidental form in this, that the accidental form \ndoes not make a thing to be \"simply,\" but to be \"such,\" as heat does not \nmake a thing to be simply, but only to be hot. Therefore by the coming of \nthe accidental form a thing is not said to be made or generated simply, \nbut to be made such, or to be in some particular condition; and in like \nmanner, when an accidental form is removed, a thing is said to be \ncorrupted, not simply, but relatively. Now the substantial form gives \nbeing simply; therefore by its coming a thing is said to be generated \nsimply; and by its removal to be corrupted simply. For this reason, the \nold natural philosophers, who held that primary matter was some actual \nbeing---for instance, fire or air, or something of that sort---maintained \nthat nothing is generated simply, or corrupted simply; and stated that \n\"every becoming is nothing but an alteration,\" as we read, Phys. i, 4. \nTherefore, if besides the intellectual soul there pre-existed in matter \nanother substantial form by which the subject of the soul were made an \nactual being, it would follow that the soul does not give being simply; \nand consequently that it is not the substantial form: and so at the \nadvent of the soul there would not be simple generation; nor at its \nremoval simple corruption, all of which is clearly false.\nWhence we must conclude, that there is no other substantial form in man \nbesides the intellectual soul; and that the soul, as it virtually \ncontains the sensitive and nutritive souls, so does it virtually contain \nall inferior forms, and itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do \nin other things.

Now matter \nsubject to dimension is not to be found except in a body. But various \nbodies cannot be in the same place.

Now the \naction of the senses is not performed without a corporeal instrument. \nTherefore it behooved the intellectual soul to be united to a body fitted \nto be a convenient organ of sense.\nNow all the other senses are based on the sense of touch. But the organ \nof touch requires to be a medium between contraries, such as hot and \ncold, wet and dry, and the like, of which the sense of touch has the \nperception; thus it is in potentiality with regard to contraries, and is \nable to perceive them. Therefore the more the organ of touch is reduced \nto an equable complexion, the more sensitive will be the touch. But the \nintellectual soul has the power of sense in all its completeness; because \nwhat belongs to the inferior nature pre-exists more perfectly in the \nsuperior, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v).

So the \nintellectual soul requires a body of equable complexion, which, however, \nis corruptible by force of its matter. If, however, it be said that God \ncould avoid this, we answer that in the formation of natural things we do \nnot consider what God might do; but what is suitable to the nature of \nthings, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 1).

But \nsince the soul is united to the body as its form, it must necessarily be \nin the whole body, and in each part thereof. For it is not an accidental \nform, but the substantial form of the body. Now the substantial form \nperfects not only the whole, but each part of the whole. For since a \nwhole consists of parts, a form of the whole which does not give \nexistence to each of the parts of the body, is a form consisting in \ncomposition and order, such as the form of a house; and such a form is \naccidental. But the soul is a substantial form; and therefore it must be \nthe form and the act, not only of the whole, but also of each part. \nTherefore, on the  withdrawal of the soul, as we do not speak of an \nanimal or a man unless equivocally, as we speak of a painted animal or a \nstone animal; so is it with the hand, the eye, the flesh and bones, as \nthe Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1). A proof of which is, that on the \nwithdrawal of the soul, no part of the body retains its proper action; \nalthough that which retains its species, retains the action of the \nspecies. But act is in that which it actuates: wherefore the soul must be \nin the whole body, and in each part thereof.\nThat it is entire in each part thereof, may be concluded from this, that \nsince a whole is that which is divided into parts, there are three kinds \nof totality, corresponding to three kinds of division. There is a whole \nwhich is divided into parts of quantity, as a whole line, or a whole \nbody. There is also a whole which is divided into logical and essential \nparts: as a thing defined is divided into the parts of a definition, and \na composite into matter and form. There is, further, a third kind of \nwhole which is potential, divided into virtual parts. The first kind of \ntotality does not apply to forms, except perhaps accidentally; and then \nonly to those forms, which have an indifferent relationship to a \nquantitative whole and its parts; as whiteness, as far as its essence is \nconcerned, is equally disposed to be in the whole surface and in each \npart of the surface; and, therefore, the surface being divided, the \nwhiteness is accidentally divided. But a form which requires variety in \nthe parts, such as a soul, and specially the soul of perfect animals, is \nnot equally related to the whole and the parts: hence it is not divided \naccidentally when the whole is divided. So therefore quantitative \ntotality cannot be attributed to the soul, either essentially or \naccidentally. But the second kind of totality, which depends on logical \nand essential perfection, properly and essentially belongs to forms: and \nlikewise the virtual totality, because a form is the principle of \noperation.\nTherefore if it be asked whether the whole whiteness is in the whole \nsurface and in each part thereof, it is necessary to distinguish. If we \nmean quantitative totality which whiteness has accidentally, then the \nwhole whiteness is not in each part of the surface. The same is to be \nsaid of totality of power: since the whiteness which is in the whole \nsurface moves the sight more than the whiteness which is in a small part \nthereof. But if we mean totality of species and essence, then the whole \nwhiteness is in each part of a surface.\nSince, however, the soul has not quantitative totality, neither \nessentially, nor accidentally, as we have seen; it is enough to say that \nthe whole soul is in each part of the body, by totality of perfection and \nof essence, but not by totality of power. For it is not in each part of \nthe body, with regard to each of its powers; but with regard to sight, it \nis in the eye; and with regard to hearing, it is in the ear; and so \nforth.

        "OB4": "Further, we sense by the sensitive power and we understand by the \nintellectual power. But \"that by which we first sense and understand\" is \nthe soul, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 2). Therefore the \nsoul is its own power.",
        "OB5": "Further, whatever does not belong to the essence is an accident. \nTherefore if the power of the soul is something else besides the essence \nthereof, it is an accident, which is contrary to Augustine, who says that \nthe foregoing (see OBJ 1) \"are not in the soul as in a subject as color \nor shape, or any other quality, or quantity, are in a body; for whatever \nis so, does not exceed the subject in which it is: Whereas the mind can \nlove and know other things\" (De Trin. ix, 4).\nObjection 6: Further, \" a simple form cannot be a subject.\" But the soul is a \nsimple form; since it is not composed of matter and form, as we have said \nabove (Question [75], Article [5]). Therefore the power of the soul cannot be in it as \nin a subject.\nObjection 7: Further, an accident is not the principle of a substantial \ndifference. But sensitive and rational are substantial differences; and \nthey are taken from sense and reason, which are powers of the soul. \nTherefore the powers of the soul are not accidents; and so it would seem \nthat the power of the soul is its own essence.\nReply to  If we take accident as meaning what is divided against \nsubstance, then there can be no medium between substance and accident; \nbecause they are divided by affirmation and negation, that is, according \nto existence in a subject, and non-existence in a subject. In this sense, \nas the power of the soul is not its essence, it must be an accident; and \nit belongs to the second species of accident, that of quality. But if we \ntake accident as one of the five universals, in this sense there is a \nmedium between substance and accident. For the substance is all that \nbelongs to the essence of a thing; whereas whatever is beyond the essence \nof a thing cannot be called accident in this sense; but only what is not \ncaused by the essential principle of the species. For the 'proper' does \nnot belong to the essence of a thing, but is caused by the essential \nprinciples of the species; wherefore it is a medium between the essence \nand accident thus understood. In this sense the powers of the soul may be \nsaid to be a medium between substance and accident, as being natural \nproperties of the soul. When Augustine says that knowledge and love are \nnot in the soul as accidents in a subject, this must be understood in the \nsense given above, inasmuch as they are compared to the soul, not as \nloving and knowing, but as loved and known. His argument proceeds in this \nsense; for if love were in the soul loved as in a subject, it would \nfollow that an accident transcends its subject, since even other things \nare loved through the soul.\nReply to Objection 6: Although the soul is not composed of matter and form, yet \nit has an admixture of potentiality, as we have said above (Question [75], Article [5], ad 4); and for this reason it can be the subject of an accident. The \nstatement quoted is verified in God, Who is the Pure Act; in treating of \nwhich subject Boethius employs that phrase (De Trin. i).\nReply to Objection 7: Rational and sensitive, as differences, are not taken from \nthe powers of sense and reason, but from the sensitive and rational soul \nitself. But because substantial forms, which in themselves are unknown to \nus, are known by their accidents; nothing prevents us from sometimes \nsubstituting accidents for substantial differences.",

        "ANS": "It is impossible to admit that the power of the soul is \nits essence, although some have maintained it. For the present purpose \nthis may be proved in two ways. First, because, since power and act \ndivide being and every kind of being, we must refer a power and its act \nto the same genus. Therefore, if the act be not in the genus of \nsubstance, the power directed to that act cannot be in the genus of \nsubstance. Now the operation of the soul is not in the genus of \nsubstance; for this belongs to God alone, whose operation is His own \nsubstance. Wherefore the Divine power which is the principle of His \noperation is the Divine Essence itself. This cannot be true either of the \nsoul, or of any creature; as we have said above when speaking of the \nangels (Question [54], Article [3]).  Secondly, this may be also shown to be impossible \nin the soul. For the soul by its very essence is an act. Therefore if the \nvery essence of the soul were the immediate principle of operation, \nwhatever has a soul would always have actual vital actions, as that which \nhas a soul is always an actually living thing. For as a form the soul is \nnot an act ordained to a further act, but the ultimate term of \ngeneration. Wherefore, for it to be in potentiality to another act, does \nnot belong to it according to its essence, as a form, but according to \nits power. So the soul itself, as the subject of its power, is called the \nfirst act, with a further relation to the second act. Now we observe that \nwhat has a soul is not always actual with respect to its vital \noperations; whence also it is said in the definition of the soul, that it \nis \"the act of a body having life potentially\"; which potentiality, \nhowever, \"does not exclude the soul.\" Therefore it follows that the \nessence of the soul is not its power.

For the \nuniversal whole is in each part according to its entire essence and \npower; as animal in a man and in a horse; and therefore it is properly \npredicated of each part. But the integral whole is not in each part, \nneither according to its whole essence, nor according to its whole power. \nTherefore in no way can it be predicated of each part; yet in a way it is \npredicated, though improperly, of all the parts together; as if we were \nto say that the wall, roof, and foundations are a house. But the \npotential whole is in each part according to its whole essence, not, \nhowever, according to its whole power. Therefore in a way it can be \npredicated of each part, but not so properly as the universal whole.

Wherefore we seek \nto know the nature of a power from the act to which it is directed, and \nconsequently the nature of a power is diversified, as the nature of the \nact is diversified. Now the nature of an act is diversified according to \nthe various natures of the objects. For every act is either of an active \npower or of a passive power. Now, the object is to the act of a passive \npower, as the principle and moving cause: for color is the principle of \nvision, inasmuch as it moves the sight. On the other hand, to the act of \nan active power the object is a term and end; as the object of the power \nof growth is perfect quantity, which is the end of growth. Now, from \nthese two things an act receives its species, namely, from its principle, \nor from its end or term; for the act of heating differs from the act of \ncooling, in this, that the former proceeds from something hot, which is \nthe active principle, to heat; the latter from something cold, which is \nthe active principle, to cold. Therefore the powers are of necessity \ndistinguished by their acts and objects.\nNevertheless, we must observe that things which are accidental do not \nchange the species. For since to be colored is accidental to an animal, \nits species is not changed by a difference of color, but by a difference \nin that which belongs to the nature of an animal, that is to say, by a \ndifference in the sensitive soul, which is sometimes rational, and \nsometimes otherwise. Hence \"rational\" and \"irrational\" are differences \ndividing animal, constituting its various species. In like manner \ntherefore, not any variety of objects diversifies the powers of the soul, \nbut a difference in that to which the power of its very nature is \ndirected. Thus the senses of their very nature are directed to the \npassive quality which of itself is divided into color, sound, and the \nlike, and therefore there is one sensitive power with regard to color, \nnamely, the sight, and another with regard to sound, namely, hearing.

But the \naccidental form does not make a thing to exist absolutely but to be such, \nor so great, or in some particular condition; for its subject is an \nactual being.

        "ANS": "There are five genera of powers of the soul, as above \nnumbered. Of these, three are called souls, and four are called modes of \nliving. The reason of this diversity lies in the various souls being \ndistinguished accordingly as the operation of the soul transcends the \noperation of the corporeal nature in various ways; for the whole \ncorporeal nature is subject to the soul, and is related to it as its \nmatter and instrument. There exists, therefore, an operation of the soul \nwhich so far exceeds the corporeal nature that it is not even performed \nby any corporeal organ; and such is the operation of the \"rational soul.\" \nBelow this, there is another operation of the soul, which is indeed \nperformed through a corporeal organ, but not through a corporeal quality, \nand this is the operation of the \"sensitive soul\"; for though hot and \ncold, wet and dry, and other such corporeal qualities are required for \nthe work of the senses, yet they are not required in such a way that the \noperation of the senses takes place by virtue of such qualities; but only \nfor the proper disposition of the organ. The lowest of the operations of \nthe soul is that which is performed by a corporeal organ, and by virtue \nof a corporeal quality. Yet this transcends the operation of the \ncorporeal nature; because the movements of bodies are caused by an \nextrinsic principle, while these operations are from an intrinsic \nprinciple; for this is common to all the operations of the soul; since \nevery animate thing, in some way, moves itself. Such is the operation of \nthe \"vegetative soul\"; for digestion, and what follows, is caused \ninstrumentally by the action of heat, as the Philosopher says (De Anima \nii, 4).\nNow the powers of the soul are distinguished generically by their \nobjects. For the higher a power is, the more universal is the object to \nwhich it extends, as we have said above (Question [77], Article [3], ad 4). But the \nobject of the soul's operation may be considered in a triple order. For \nin the soul there is a power the object of which is only the body that is \nunited to that soul; the powers of this genus are called \"vegetative\" for \nthe vegetative power acts only on the body to which the soul is united. \nThere is another genus in the powers of the soul, which genus regards a \nmore universal object---namely, every sensible body, not only the body to \nwhich the soul is united. And there is yet another genus in the powers of \nthe soul, which genus regards a still more universal object---namely, not \nonly the sensible body, but all being in universal. Wherefore it is \nevident that the latter two genera of the soul's powers have an operation \nin regard not merely to that which is united to them, but also to \nsomething extrinsic. Now, since whatever operates must in some way be \nunited to the object about which it operates, it follows of necessity \nthat this something extrinsic, which is the object of the soul's \noperation, must be related to the soul in a twofold manner. First, \ninasmuch as this something extrinsic has a natural aptitude to be united \nto the soul, and to be by its likeness in the soul. In this way there are \ntwo kinds of powers ---namely, the \"sensitive\" in regard to the  less \ncommon object---the sensible body; and the \"intellectual,\" in regard to \nthe most common object---universal being. Secondly, forasmuch as the soul \nitself has an inclination and tendency to the something extrinsic. And in \nthis way there are again two kinds of powers in the soul: one---the \n\"appetitive\"---in respect of which the soul is referred to something \nextrinsic as to an end, which is first in the intention; the other---the \n\"locomotive\" power---in respect of which the soul is referred to \nsomething extrinsic as to the term of its operation and movement; for \nevery animal is moved for the purpose of realizing its desires and \nintentions.\nThe modes of living are distinguished according to the degrees of living \nthings. There are some living things in which there exists only \nvegetative power, as the plants. There are others in which with the \nvegetative there exists also the sensitive, but not the locomotive power; \nsuch as immovable animals, as shellfish. There are others which besides \nthis have locomotive powers, as perfect animals, which require many \nthings for their life, and consequently movement to seek necessaries of \nlife from a distance. And there are some living things which with these \nhave intellectual power---namely, men. But the appetitive power does not \nconstitute a degree of living things; because wherever there is sense \nthere is also appetite (De Anima ii, 3).\nThus the first two objectives are hereby solved.",
        "RP3": "The \"natural appetite\" is that inclination which each thing \nhas, of its own nature, for something; wherefore by its natural appetite \neach power desires something suitable to itself. But the \"animal \nappetite\" results from the form apprehended; this sort of appetite \nrequires a special power of the soul---mere apprehension does not \nsuffice. For a thing is desired as it exists in its own nature, whereas \nin the apprehensive power it exists not according to its own nature, but \naccording to its likeness. Whence it is clear that sight desires \nnaturally a visible object for the purpose of its act only---namely, for \nthe purpose of seeing; but the animal by the appetitive power desires the \nthing seen, not merely for the purpose of seeing it, but also for other \npurposes. But if the soul did not require things perceived by the senses, \nexcept on account of the actions of the senses, that is, for the purpose \nof sensing them; there would be no need for a special genus of appetitive \npowers, since the natural appetite of the powers would suffice.",
        "RP4": "Although sense and appetite are principles of movement in \nperfect animals, yet sense and appetite, as such, are not sufficient to \ncause movement, unless another power be added to them; for immovable \nanimals have sense and appetite, and yet they have not the power of \nmotion. Now this motive power is not only in the appetite and sense as \ncommanding the movement, but also in the parts of the body, to make them \nobey the appetite of the soul which moves them. Of this we have a sign in \nthe fact that when the members are deprived of their natural disposition, \nthey do not move in obedience to the appetite."

Another is whereby the living body acquires its due \nquantity; to this is directed the \"augmentative\" power. Another is \nwhereby the body of a living thing is preserved in its existence and in \nits due quantity; to this is directed the \"nutritive\" power.\nWe must, however, observe a difference among these powers. The nutritive \nand the augmentative have their effect where they exist, since the body \nitself united to the soul grows and is preserved by the augmentative and \nnutritive powers which exist in one and the same soul.

By others it has been \nassigned to the medium, which is either in conjunction or extrinsic and \nis either water or air, or such like. Others have ascribed it to the \nvarious natures of the sensible qualities, according as such quality \nbelongs to a simple body or results from complexity. But none of these \nexplanations is apt. For the powers are not for the organs, but the \norgans for the powers; wherefore there are not various powers for the \nreason that there are various organs; on the contrary, for this has \nnature provided a variety of organs, that they might be adapted to \nvarious powers. In the same way nature provided various mediums for the \nvarious senses, according to the convenience of the acts of the powers. \nAnd to be cognizant of the natures of sensible qualities does not pertain \nto the senses, but to the intellect.\nThe reason of the number and distinction of the exterior senses must \ntherefore be ascribed to that which belongs to the senses properly and \n\"per se.\" Now, sense is a passive power, and is naturally immuted by the \nexterior sensible. Wherefore the exterior cause of such immutation is \nwhat is \"per se\" perceived by the sense, and according to the diversity \nof that exterior cause are the sensitive powers diversified.\nNow, immutation is of two kinds, one natural, the other spiritual. \nNatural immutation takes place by the form of the immuter being received \naccording to its natural existence, into the thing immuted, as heat is \nreceived into the thing heated. Whereas spiritual immutation takes place \nby the form of the immuter being received, according to a spiritual mode \nof existence, into the thing immuted, as the form of color is received \ninto the pupil which does not thereby become colored. Now, for the \noperation of the senses, a spiritual immutation is required, whereby an \nintention of the sensible form is effected in the sensile organ. \nOtherwise, if a natural immutation alone sufficed for the sense's action, \nall natural bodies would feel when they undergo alteration.\nBut in some senses we find spiritual immutation only, as in \"sight\" \nwhile in others we find not only spiritual but also a natural immutation; \neither on the part of the object only, or likewise on the part of the \norgan. On the part of the object we  find natural immutation, as to \nplace, in sound which is the object of \"hearing\"; for sound is caused by \npercussion and commotion of air: and we find natural immutation by \nalteration, in odor which is the object of \"smelling\"; for in order to \nexhale an odor, a body must be in a measure affected by heat. On the part \nof an organ, natural immutation takes place in \"touch\" and \"taste\"; for \nthe hand that touches something hot becomes hot, while the tongue is \nmoistened by the humidity of the flavored morsel. But the organs of \nsmelling and hearing are not affected in their respective operations by \nany natural immutation unless indirectly.\nNow, the sight, which is without natural immutation either in its organ \nor in its object, is the most spiritual, the most perfect, and the most \nuniversal of all the senses. After this comes the hearing and then the \nsmell, which require a natural immutation on the part of the object; \nwhile local motion is more perfect than, and naturally prior to, the \nmotion of alteration, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 7). Touch \nand taste are the most material of all: of the distinction of which we \nshall speak later on (ad 3,4). Hence it is that the three other senses \nare not exercised through a medium united to them, to obviate any natural \nimmutation in their organ; as happens as regards these two senses.",
        "RP1": "Not every accident has in itself a power of immutation but \nonly qualities of the third species, which are the principles of \nalteration: therefore only suchlike qualities are the objects of the \nsenses; because \"the senses are affected by the same things whereby \ninanimate bodies are affected,\" as stated in Phys. vii, 2.",
        "RP2": "Size, shape, and the like, which are called \"common \nsensibles,\" are midway between \"accidental sensibles\" and \"proper \nsensibles,\" which are the objects of the senses. For the proper sensibles \nfirst, and of their very nature, affect the senses; since they are \nqualities that cause alteration. But the common sensibles are all \nreducible to quantity. As to size and number, it is clear that they are \nspecies of quantity. Shape is a quality about quantity. Shape is a \nquality about quantity, since the notion of shape consists of fixing the \nbounds of magnitude. Movement and rest are sensed according as the \nsubject is affected in one or more ways in the magnitude of the subject \nor of its local distance, as in the movement of growth or of locomotion, \nor again, according as it is affected in some sensible qualities, as in \nthe movement of alteration; and thus to sense movement and rest is, in a \nway, to sense one thing and many. Now quantity is the proximate subject \nof the qualities that cause alteration, as surface is of color. Therefore \nthe common sensibles do not move the senses first and of their own \nnature, but by reason of the sensible quality; as the surface by reason \nof color. Yet they are not accidental sensibles, for they produce a \ncertain variety in the immutation of the senses. For sense is immuted \ndifferently by a large and by a small surface: since whiteness itself is \nsaid to be great or small, and therefore it is divided according to its \nproper subject.",

But taste, which perceives the sweet and the bitter, accompanies \ntouch in the tongue, but not in the whole body; so it is easily \ndistinguished from touch. We might also say that all those contrarieties \nagree, each in some proximate genus, and all in a common genus, which is \nthe common and formal object of touch.

But if touch is one sense only, on \naccount of the common formality of its object: we must say that taste is \ndistinguished from touch by reason of a different formality of \nimmutation. For touch involves a natural, and not only a spiritual, \nimmutation in its organ, by reason of the quality which is its proper \nobject. But the organ of taste is not necessarily immuted by a natural \nimmutation by reason of the quality which is its proper object, so that \nthe tongue itself becomes sweet and bitter: but by reason of a quality \nwhich is a preamble to, and on which is based, the flavor, which quality \nis moisture, the object of touch."

        "ANS": "As nature does not fail in necessary things, there must \nneeds be as many actions of the sensitive soul as may suffice for the \nlife of a perfect animal. If any of these actions cannot be reduced to \nthe same one principle, they must be assigned to diverse powers; since a \npower of the soul is nothing else than the proximate principle of the \nsoul's operation.\nNow we must observe that for the life of a perfect animal, the animal \nshould apprehend a thing not only at the actual time of sensation, but \nalso when it is absent. Otherwise, since animal motion and action follow \napprehension, an animal would not be moved to seek something absent: the \ncontrary of which we may observe specially in perfect animals, which are \nmoved by progression, for they are moved towards something apprehended \nand absent. Therefore an animal through the sensitive soul must not only \nreceive the species of sensible things, when it is actually affected by \nthem, but it must also retain and preserve them. Now to receive and \nretain are, in corporeal things, reduced to diverse principles; for moist \nthings are apt to receive, but retain with difficulty, while it is the \nreverse with dry things. Wherefore, since the sensitive power is the act \nof a corporeal organ, it follows that the power which receives the \nspecies of sensible things must be distinct from the power which \npreserves them.\nAgain we must observe that if an animal were moved by pleasing and \ndisagreeable things only as affecting the sense, there would be no need \nto suppose that an animal has a power besides the apprehension of those \nforms which the senses perceive, and in which the animal takes pleasure, \nor from which it shrinks with horror. But the animal needs to seek or to \navoid certain things, not only because they are pleasing or otherwise to \nthe senses, but also on account of other advantages and uses, or \ndisadvantages: just as the sheep runs away when it sees a wolf, not on \naccount of its color or shape, but as a natural enemy: and again a bird \ngathers together straws, not because they are pleasant to the sense, but \nbecause they are useful for building its nest. Animals, therefore, need \nto perceive such intentions, which the exterior sense does not perceive. \nAnd some distinct principle is necessary for this; since the perception \nof sensible forms comes by an immutation caused by the sensible, which is \nnot the case with the perception of those intentions.\nThus, therefore, for the reception of sensible forms, the \"proper sense\" \nand the \"common sense\" are appointed, and of their distinction we shall \nspeak farther on (ad 1,2). But for the retention and preservation of \nthese forms, the \"phantasy\" or \"imagination\" is appointed; which are the \nsame, for phantasy or imagination is as it were a storehouse of forms \nreceived through the senses. Furthermore, for the apprehension of \nintentions which are not received through the senses, the \"estimative\" \npower is appointed: and for the preservation thereof, the \"memorative\" \npower, which is a storehouse of such-like intentions. A sign of which we \nhave in the fact that the principle of memory in animals is found in some \nsuch intention, for instance, that something is harmful or otherwise. And \nthe very formality of the past, which memory observes, is to be reckoned \namong these intentions.\nNow, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no difference \nbetween man and other animals; for they are similarly immuted by the \nextrinsic sensible. But there is a difference as to the above intentions: \nfor other animals perceive these intentions only by some natural \ninstinct, while man perceives them by means of coalition of ideas. \nTherefore the power by which in other animals is called the natural \nestimative, in man is called the \"cogitative,\" which by some sort of \ncollation discovers these intentions. Wherefore it is also called the \n\"particular reason,\" to which medical men assign a certain particular \norgan, namely, the middle part of the head: for it compares individual \nintentions, just as the intellectual reason compares universal \nintentions. As to the memorative power, man has not only memory, as other \nanimals have in the sudden recollection of the past; but also \n\"reminiscence\" by syllogistically, as it were, seeking for a recollection \nof the past by the application of individual intentions. Avicenna, \nhowever, assigns between the estimative and the imaginative, a fifth \npower, which combines and divides imaginary forms: as when from the \nimaginary form of gold, and imaginary form of a mountain, we compose the \none form of a golden mountain, which we have never seen. But this \noperation is not to be  found in animals other than man, in whom the \nimaginative power suffices thereto. To man also does Averroes attribute \nthis action in his book De sensu et sensibilibus (viii). So there is no \nneed to assign more than four interior powers of the sensitive \npart---namely, the common sense, the imagination, and the estimative and \nmemorative powers.",

        "ANS": "To be passive may be taken in three ways. Firstly, in its \nmost strict sense, when from a thing is taken something which belongs to \nit by virtue either of its nature, or of its proper inclination: as when \nwater loses coolness by heating, and as when a man becomes ill or sad. \nSecondly, less strictly, a thing is said to be passive, when something, \nwhether suitable or unsuitable, is taken away from it. And in this way \nnot only he who is ill is said to be passive, but also he who is healed; \nnot only he that is sad, but also he that is joyful; or whatever way he \nbe altered or moved. Thirdly, in a wide sense a thing is said to be \npassive, from the very fact that what is in potentiality to something \nreceives that to which it was in potentiality, without being deprived of \nanything. And accordingly, whatever passes from potentiality to act, may \nbe said to be passive, even when it is perfected. And thus with us to \nunderstand is to be passive. This is clear from the following reason. For \nthe intellect, as we have seen above (Question [78], Article [1]), has an operation \nextending to universal being. We may therefore see whether the intellect \nbe in act or potentiality by observing first of all the nature of the \nrelation of the intellect to universal being. For we find an intellect \nwhose relation to universal being is that of the act of all being: and \nsuch is the Divine intellect, which is the Essence of God, in which \noriginally and virtually, all being pre-exists as in its first cause. And \ntherefore the Divine intellect is not in potentiality, but is pure act. \nBut no created intellect can be an act in relation to the whole universal \nbeing; otherwise it would needs be an infinite being. Wherefore every \ncreated intellect is not the act of all things intelligible, by reason of \nits very existence; but is compared to these intelligible things as a \npotentiality to act.\nNow, potentiality has a double relation to act. There is a potentiality \nwhich is always perfected by its act: as the matter of the heavenly \nbodies (Question [58], Article [1]). And there is another potentiality which is not \nalways in act, but proceeds from potentiality to act; as we observe in \nthings that are corrupted and generated. Wherefore the angelic intellect \nis always in act as regards those things which it can understand, by \nreason of its proximity to the first intellect, which is pure act, as we \nhave said above. But the human intellect, which is the lowest in the \norder of intelligence and most remote from the perfection of the Divine \nintellect, is in potentiality with regard to things intelligible, and is \nat first \"like a clean tablet on which nothing is written,\" as the \nPhilosopher says (De Anima iii, 4). This is made clear from the fact, \nthat at first we are only in potentiality to understand, and afterwards \nwe are made to understand actually. And so it is evident that with us to \nunderstand is \"in a way to be passive\"; taking passion in the third \nsense. And consequently the intellect is a passive power.",

Others give the name of passive intellect to the \ncogitative power, which is called the \"particular reason.\" And in each \ncase \"passive\" may be taken in the two first senses; forasmuch as this \nso-called intellect is the act of a corporeal organ. But the intellect \nwhich is in potentiality to things intelligible, and which for this \nreason Aristotle calls the \"possible\" intellect (De Anima iii, 4) is not \npassive except in the third sense: for it is not an act of a corporeal \norgan.

For \nwhat is such by participation, and what is mobile, and what is imperfect \nalways requires the pre-existence of something essentially such, \nimmovable and perfect. Now the human soul is called intellectual by \nreason of a participation in  intellectual power; a sign of which is that \nit is not wholly intellectual but only in part. Moreover it reaches to \nthe understanding of truth by arguing, with a certain amount of reasoning \nand movement. Again it has an imperfect understanding; both because it \ndoes not understand everything, and because, in those things which it \ndoes understand, it passes from potentiality to act. Therefore there must \nneeds be some higher intellect, by which the soul is helped to understand.\nWherefore some held that this intellect, substantially separate, is the \nactive intellect, which by lighting up the phantasms as it were, makes \nthem to be actually intelligible. But, even supposing the existence of \nsuch a separate active intellect, it would still be necessary to assign \nto the human soul some power participating in that superior intellect, by \nwhich power the human soul makes things actually intelligible. Just as in \nother perfect natural things, besides the universal active causes, each \none is endowed with its proper powers derived from those universal \ncauses: for the sun alone does not generate man; but in man is the power \nof begetting man: and in like manner with other perfect animals.

        "ANS": "Since it is of the nature of the memory to preserve the \nspecies of those things which are not actually apprehended, we must first \nof all consider whether the intelligible species can thus be preserved in \nthe intellect: because Avicenna held that this was impossible. For he \nadmitted that this could happen in the sensitive part, as to some powers, \ninasmuch as they are acts of corporeal organs, in which certain species \nmay be preserved apart from actual apprehension. But in the intellect, \nwhich has no corporeal organ, nothing but what is intelligible exists. \nWherefore every thing of which the likeness exists in the intellect must \nbe actually understood. Thus, therefore, according to him, as soon as we \ncease to understand something actually, the species of that thing ceases \nto be in our intellect, and if we wish to understand that thing anew, we \nmust turn to the active intellect, which he held to be a separate \nsubstance, in order that the intelligible species may thence flow again \ninto our passive intellect. And from the practice and habit of turning to \nthe active intellect there is formed, according to him, a certain \naptitude in the passive intellect for turning to the active intellect; \nwhich aptitude he calls the habit of knowledge. According, therefore, to \nthis supposition, nothing is preserved in the intellectual part that is \nnot actually understood: wherefore it would not be possible to admit \nmemory in the intellectual part.\nBut this opinion is clearly opposed to the teaching of Aristotle. For he \nsays (De Anima iii, 4) that, when the passive intellect \"is identified \nwith each thing as knowing it, it is said to be in act,\" and that \"this \nhappens when it can operate of itself. And, even then, it is in \npotentiality, but not in the same way as before learning and \ndiscovering.\" Now, the passive intellect is said to be each thing, \ninasmuch as it receives the intelligible species of each thing. To the \nfact, therefore, that it receives the species of intelligible things it \nowes its being able to operate when it wills, but not so that it be \nalways operating: for even then is it in potentiality in a certain sense, \nthough otherwise than before the act of understanding---namely, in the \nsense that whoever has habitual knowledge is in potentiality to actual \nconsideration.\nThe foregoing opinion is also opposed to reason. For what is received \ninto something is received according to the conditions of the recipient. \nBut the intellect is of a more stable nature, and is more immovable than \ncorporeal nature. If, therefore, corporeal matter holds the forms which \nit receives, not only while it actually does something through them, but \nalso after ceasing to act through them, much more cogent reason is there \nfor the intellect to receive the species unchangeably and lastingly, \nwhether it receive them from things sensible, or derive them from some \nsuperior intellect. Thus, therefore, if we take memory only for the power \nof retaining species, we must say that it is in the intellectual part. \nBut if in the notion of memory we include its object as something past, \nthen the memory is not in the intellectual, but only in the sensitive \npart, which apprehends individual things. For past, as past, since it \nsignifies being under a condition of fixed time, is something individual.",

For species are not retained in the \nsensitive part of the soul only, but rather in the body and soul united: \nsince the memorative power is the act of some organ. But the intellect in \nitself is retentive of species, without the association of any corporeal \norgan.

But as \nconcerns the intellectual part, the past is accidental, and is not in \nitself a part of the object of the intellect. For the intellect \nunderstands man, as man: and to man, as man, it is accidental that he \nexist in the present, past, or future. But on the part of the act, the \ncondition of past, even as such, may be understood to be in the \nintellect, as well as in the senses. Because our soul's act of \nunderstanding is an individual act, existing in this or that time, \ninasmuch as a man is said to understand now, or yesterday, or tomorrow. \nAnd this is not incompatible with the intellectual nature: for such an \nact of understanding, though something individual, is yet an immaterial \nact, as we have said above of the intellect (Question [76], Article [1]); and therefore, \nas the intellect understands itself, though it be itself an individual \nintellect, so also it understands its act of understanding, which is an \nindividual act, in the past, present, or future.

For conscience, \naccording to the very nature of the word, implies the relation of \nknowledge to something: for conscience may be resolved into \"cum alio \nscientia,\" i.e. knowledge applied to an individual case. But the \napplication of knowledge to something is done by some act. Wherefore from \nthis explanation of the name it is clear that conscience is an act.\nThe same is manifest from those things which are attributed to \nconscience. For conscience is said to witness, to bind, or incite, and \nalso to accuse, torment, or rebuke. And all these follow the application \nof knowledge or science to what we do: which application is made in three \nways. One way in so far as we recognize that we have done or not done \nsomething; \"Thy conscience knoweth that thou hast often spoken evil of \nothers\" (Eccles. 7:23), and according to this, conscience is said to \nwitness. In another way, so far as through the conscience we judge that \nsomething should be done or not done; and in this sense, conscience is \nsaid to incite or to bind. In the third way, so far as by conscience we \njudge that something done is well done or ill done, and in this sense \nconscience is said to excuse, accuse, or torment. Now, it is clear that \nall these things follow the actual application of knowledge to what we \ndo. Wherefore, properly speaking, conscience denominates an act. But \nsince habit is a principle of act, sometimes the name conscience is given \nto the first natural  habit---namely, 'synderesis': thus Jerome calls \n'synderesis' conscience (Gloss.

For \nexample, fire has a natural inclination, not only to rise from a lower \nposition, which is unsuitable to it, towards a higher position which is \nsuitable, but also to resist whatever destroys or hinders its action. \nTherefore, since the sensitive appetite is an inclination following \nsensitive apprehension, as natural appetite is an inclination following \nthe natural form, there must needs be in the sensitive part two \nappetitive powers---one through which the soul is simply inclined to seek \nwhat is suitable, according to the senses, and to fly from what is \nhurtful, and this is called the concupiscible: and another, whereby an \nanimal resists these attacks that hinder what is suitable, and inflict \nharm, and this is called the irascible.

Now these two are not to be reduced to one principle: for \nsometimes the soul busies itself with unpleasant things, against the \ninclination of the concupiscible appetite, in order that, following the \nimpulse of the irascible appetite, it may fight against obstacles. \nWherefore also the passions of the irascible appetite counteract the \npassions of the concupiscible appetite: since the concupiscence, on being \naroused, diminishes anger; and anger being roused, diminishes \nconcupiscence in many cases. This is clear also from the fact that the \nirascible is, as it were, the champion and defender of the concupiscible \nwhen it rises up against what hinders the acquisition of the suitable \nthings which the concupiscible desires, or against what inflicts harm, \nfrom which the concupiscible flies.

This is called \"necessity of end,\" and \nsometimes also \"utility.\" On the part of the agent, a thing must be, when \nsomeone is forced by some agent, so that he is not able to do the \ncontrary. This is called \"necessity of coercion.\"\nNow this necessity of coercion is altogether repugnant to the will. For \nwe call that violent which is against the inclination of a thing. But the \nvery movement of the will is an inclination to something. Therefore, as a \nthing is called natural because it is according to the inclination of \nnature, so a thing is called voluntary because it is according to the \ninclination of the will. Therefore, just as it is impossible for a thing \nto be at the same time violent and natural, so it is impossible for a \nthing to be absolutely coerced or violent, and voluntary.\nBut necessity of end is not repugnant to the will, when the end cannot \nbe attained except in one way: thus from the will to cross the sea, \narises in the will the necessity to wish for a ship.\nIn like manner neither is natural necessity repugnant to the will. \nIndeed, more than this, for as the intellect of necessity adheres to the \nfirst principles, the will must of necessity adhere to the last end, \nwhich is happiness: since the end is in practical matters what the \nprinciple is in speculative matters. For what befits a thing naturally \nand immovably must be the root and principle of all else appertaining \nthereto, since the nature of a thing is the first in everything, and \nevery movement arises from something immovable.",

If therefore the \nintellect and will be considered with regard to themselves, then the \nintellect is the higher power. And this is clear if we compare their \nrespective objects to one another. For the object of the intellect is \nmore simple and more absolute than the object of the will; since the \nobject of the intellect is the very idea of appetible good; and the \nappetible good, the idea of which is in the intellect, is the object of \nthe will. Now the more simple and the more abstract a thing is, the \nnobler and higher it is in itself; and therefore the object of the \nintellect is higher than the object of the will. Therefore, since the \nproper nature of a power is in its order to its object, it follows that \nthe intellect in itself and absolutely is higher and nobler than the \nwill. But relatively and by comparison with something else, we find that \nthe will is sometimes higher than the intellect, from the fact that the \nobject of the will occurs in something higher than that in which occurs \nthe object of the intellect. Thus, for instance, I might say that hearing \nis relatively nobler than sight, inasmuch as something in which there is \nsound is nobler than something in which there is color, though color is \nnobler and simpler than sound. For as we have said above (Question [16], Article [1]; Question [27], Article [4]), the action of the intellect consists in this---that the \nidea of the thing understood is in the one who understands; while the act \nof the will consists in this---that the will is inclined to the thing \nitself as existing in itself. And therefore the Philosopher says in \nMetaph. vi (Did. v, 2) that \"good and evil,\" which are objects of the \nwill, \"are in things,\" but \"truth and error,\" which are objects of the \nintellect,  \"are in the mind.\" When, therefore, the thing in which there \nis good is nobler than the soul itself, in which is the idea understood; \nby comparison with such a thing, the will is higher than the intellect. \nBut when the thing which is good is less noble than the soul, then even \nin comparison with that thing the intellect is higher than the will. \nWherefore the love of God is better than the knowledge of God; but, on \nthe contrary, the knowledge of corporeal things is better than the love \nthereof.

Secondly, a thing is said to move as an \nagent, as what alters moves what is altered, and what impels moves what \nis impelled. In this way the will moves the intellect and all the powers \nof the soul, as Anselm says (Eadmer, De Similitudinibus). The reason is, \nbecause wherever we have order among a number of active powers, that \npower which regards the universal end moves the powers which regard \nparticular ends. And we may observe this both in nature and in things \npolitic. For the heaven, which aims at the universal preservation of \nthings subject to generation and corruption, moves all inferior bodies, \neach of which aims at the preservation of its own species or of the \nindividual. The king also, who aims at the common good of the whole \nkingdom, by his rule moves all the governors of cities, each of whom \nrules over his own particular city. Now the object of the will is good \nand the end in general, and each power is directed to some suitable good \nproper to it, as sight is directed to the perception of color, and the \nintellect to the knowledge of truth.

If, therefore, \nthe intellect and the will be compared with one another according to the \nuniversality of their respective objects, then, as we have said above \n(Article [3]), the intellect is simply higher and nobler than the will. If, \nhowever, we take the intellect as regards the common nature of its object \nand the will as a determinate power, then again the intellect is higher \nand nobler than the will, because under the notion of being and truth is \ncontained both the will itself, and its act, and its object. Wherefore \nthe intellect understands the will, and its act, and its object, just as \nit understands other species of things, as stone or wood, which are \ncontained in the common notion of being and truth.

And in this way the \nwill is higher than the intellect, and can move it. From this we can  \neasily understand why these powers include one another in their acts, \nbecause the intellect understands that the will wills, and the will wills \nthe intellect to understand. In the same way good is contained in truth, \ninasmuch as it is an understood truth, and truth in good, inasmuch as it \nis a desired good.",

Wherefore it is against the very notion of \nfree-will that it should be a natural habit. And that it should be a \nnon-natural habit is against its nature. Therefore in no sense is it a \nhabit.\nSecondly, this is clear because habits are defined as that \"by reason of \nwhich we are well or ill disposed with regard to actions and passions\" \n(Ethic. ii, 5); for by temperance we are well-disposed as regards \nconcupiscences, and by intemperance ill-disposed: and by knowledge we are \nwell-disposed to the act of the intellect when we know the truth, and by \nthe contrary ill-disposed. But the free-will is indifferent to good and \nevil choice: wherefore it is impossible for free-will to be a habit. \nTherefore it is a power.",

Therefore we must consider the nature of \nfree-will, by considering the nature of choice. Now two things concur in \nchoice: one on the part of the cognitive power, the other on the part of \nthe appetitive power. On the part of the cognitive power, counsel is \nrequired, by which we judge one thing to be preferred to another: and on \nthe part of the appetitive power, it is required that the appetite should \naccept the judgment of counsel. Therefore Aristotle (Ethic. vi, 2) leaves \nit in doubt whether choice belongs principally to the appetitive or the \ncognitive power: since he says that choice is either \"an appetitive \nintellect or an intellectual appetite.\" But (Ethic. iii, 3) he inclines \nto its being an intellectual appetite when he describes choice as \"a \ndesire proceeding from counsel.\" And the reason of this is because the \nproper object of choice is the means to the end: and this, as such, is in \nthe nature of that good which is called useful: wherefore since good, as \nsuch, is the object of the appetite, it follows that choice is \nprincipally an act of the appetitive power.

Now, as on the \npart of the intellectual apprehension we have intellect and reason, so on \nthe part of the intellectual appetite we have will, and free-will which \nis nothing else but the power of choice. And this is clear from their \nrelations to their respective objects and acts. For the act of \n\"understanding\" implies the simple acceptation of something; whence we \nsay that we understand first principles, which are known of themselves \nwithout any comparison. But to \"reason,\" properly speaking, is to come \nfrom one thing to the knowledge of another: wherefore, properly speaking, \nwe reason about conclusions, which are known from the principles. In like \nmanner on the part of the appetite to \"will\" implies the simple appetite \nfor something: wherefore the will is said to regard the end, which is \ndesired for itself.

Now, in matters of knowledge, the principles are \nrelated to the conclusion to which we assent on account of the \nprinciples: just as, in appetitive matters, the end is related to the \nmeans, which is desired on account of the end. Wherefore it is evident \nthat as the intellect is to reason, so is the will to the power of \nchoice, which is free-will. But it has been shown above (Question [79], Article [8]) \nthat it belongs to the same power both to understand and to reason, even \nas it belongs to the same power to be at rest and to be in movement. \nWherefore it belongs also to the same power to will and to choose: and on \nthis account the will and the free-will are not two powers, but one.",

        "ANS": "It should be said in order to elucidate this question, \nthat the early philosophers, who inquired into the natures of things, \nthought there was nothing in the world save bodies. And because they \nobserved that all bodies are mobile, and considered them to be ever in a \nstate of flux, they were of opinion that we can have no certain knowledge \nof the true nature of things. For what is in a continual state of flux, \ncannot be grasped with any degree of certitude, for it passes away ere \nthe mind can form a judgment thereon: according to the saying of \nHeraclitus, that \"it is not possible twice to touch a drop of water in a \npassing torrent,\" as the Philosopher relates (Metaph. iv, Did. iii, 5).\nAfter these came Plato, who, wishing to save the certitude of our \nknowledge of truth through the intellect, maintained that, besides these \nthings corporeal, there is another genus of beings, separate from matter \nand movement, which beings he called \"species\" or \"ideas,\" by \nparticipation of which each one of these singular and sensible things is \nsaid to be either a man, or a horse, or the like. Wherefore he said that \nsciences and definitions, and whatever appertains to the act of the \nintellect, are not referred to these sensible bodies, but to those beings \nimmaterial and separate: so that according to this the soul does not \nunderstand these corporeal things, but the separate species thereof.\nNow this may be shown to be false for two reasons. First, because, since \nthose species are immaterial and immovable, knowledge of movement and \nmatter would be excluded from science (which knowledge is proper to \nnatural science), and likewise all demonstration through moving and \nmaterial causes. Secondly, because it seems ridiculous, when we seek for \nknowledge of things which are to us manifest, to introduce other beings, \nwhich cannot be the substance of those others, since they differ from \nthem essentially: so that granted that we have a knowledge of those \nseparate substances, we cannot for that reason claim to form a judgment \nconcerning these sensible things.\nNow it seems that Plato strayed from the truth because, having observed \nthat all knowledge takes place through some kind of  similitude, he \nthought that the form of the thing known must of necessity be in the \nknower in the same manner as in the thing known. Then he observed that \nthe form of the thing understood is in the intellect under conditions of \nuniversality, immateriality, and immobility: which is apparent from the \nvery operation of the intellect, whose act of understanding has a \nuniversal extension, and is subject to a certain amount of necessity: for \nthe mode of action corresponds to the mode of the agent's form. Wherefore \nhe concluded that the things which we understand must have in themselves \nan existence under the same conditions of immateriality and immobility.\nBut there is no necessity for this. For even in sensible things it is to \nbe observed that the form is otherwise in one sensible than in another: \nfor instance, whiteness may be of great intensity in one, and of a less \nintensity in another: in one we find whiteness with sweetness, in another \nwithout sweetness. In the same way the sensible form is conditioned \ndifferently in the thing which is external to the soul, and in the senses \nwhich receive the forms of sensible things without receiving matter, such \nas the color of gold without receiving gold. So also the intellect, \naccording to its own mode, receives under conditions of immateriality and \nimmobility, the species of material and mobile bodies: for the received \nis in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver. We must \nconclude, therefore, that through the intellect the soul knows bodies by \na knowledge which is immaterial, universal, and necessary.",
        "RP1": "These words of Augustine are to be understood as referring \nto the medium of intellectual knowledge, and not to its object. For the \nintellect knows bodies by understanding them, not indeed through bodies, \nnor through material and corporeal species; but through immaterial and \nintelligible species, which can be in the soul by their own essence.",
        "RP2": "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii, 29), it is not correct \nto say that as the sense knows only bodies so the intellect knows only \nspiritual things; for it follows that God and the angels would not know \ncorporeal things. The reason of this diversity is that the lower power \ndoes not extend to those things that belong to the higher power; whereas \nthe higher power operates in a more excellent manner those things which \nbelong to the lower power.",

        "ANS": "The ancient philosophers held that the soul knows bodies \nthrough its essence. For it was universally admitted that \"like is known \nby like.\" But they thought that the form of the thing known is in the \nknower in the same mode as in the thing known. The Platonists however \nwere of a contrary opinion. For Plato, having observed that the \nintellectual soul has an immaterial nature, and an immaterial mode of \nknowledge, held that the forms of things known subsist immaterially. \nWhile the earlier natural philosophers, observing that things known are \ncorporeal and material, held that things known must exist materially even \nin the soul that knows them. And therefore, in order to ascribe to the \nsoul a knowledge of all things, they held that it has the same nature in \ncommon with all. And because the nature of a result is determined by its \nprinciples, they ascribed to the soul the nature of a principle; so that \nthose who thought fire to be the principle of all, held that the soul had \nthe nature of fire; and in like manner as to air and water. Lastly, \nEmpedocles, who held the existence of our four material elements and two \nprinciples of movement, said that the soul was composed of these. \nConsequently, since they held that things exist in the soul materially, \nthey maintained that all the soul's knowledge is material, thus failing \nto discern intellect from sense.\nBut this opinion will not hold. First, because in the material principle \nof which they spoke, the various results do not exist save in \npotentiality. But a thing is not known according as it is  in \npotentiality, but only according as it is in act, as is shown Metaph. ix \n(Did. viii, 9): wherefore neither is a power known except through its \nact. It is therefore insufficient to ascribe to the soul the nature of \nthe principles in order to explain the fact that it knows all, unless we \nfurther admit in the soul natures and forms of each individual result, \nfor instance, of bone, flesh, and the like; thus does Aristotle argue \nagainst Empedocles (De Anima i, 5). Secondly, because if it were \nnecessary for the thing known to exist materially in the knower, there \nwould be no reason why things which have a material existence outside the \nsoul should be devoid of knowledge; why, for instance, if by fire the \nsoul knows fire, that fire also which is outside the soul should not have \nknowledge of fire.\nWe must conclude, therefore, that material things known must needs exist \nin the knower, not materially, but immaterially. The reason of this is, \nbecause the act of knowledge extends to things outside the knower: for we \nknow things even that are external to us. Now by matter the form of a \nthing is determined to some one thing. Wherefore it is clear that \nknowledge is in inverse ratio of materiality. And consequently things \nthat are not receptive of forms save materially, have no power of \nknowledge whatever---such as plants, as the Philosopher says (De Anima \nii, 12). But the more immaterially a thing receives the form of the thing \nknown, the more perfect is its knowledge. Therefore the intellect which \nabstracts the species not only from matter, but also from the \nindividuating conditions of matter, has more perfect knowledge than the \nsenses, which receive the form of the thing known, without matter indeed, \nbut subject to material conditions. Moreover, among the senses, sight has \nthe most perfect knowledge, because it is the least material, as we have \nremarked above (Question [78], Article [3]): while among intellects the more perfect is \nthe more immaterial.\nIt is therefore clear from the foregoing, that if there be an intellect \nwhich knows all things by its essence, then its essence must needs have \nall things in itself immaterially; thus the early philosophers held that \nthe essence of the soul, that it may know all things, must be actually \ncomposed of the principles of all material things. Now this is proper to \nGod, that His Essence comprise all things immaterially as effects \npre-exist virtually in their cause. God alone, therefore, understands all \nthings through His Essence: but neither the human soul nor the angels can \ndo so.",

Now we observe that man sometimes is only a potential knower, both \nas to sense and as to intellect. And he is reduced from such potentiality \nto act---through the action of sensible objects on his senses, to the act \nof sensation---by instruction or discovery, to the act of understanding. \nWherefore we must say that the cognitive soul is in potentiality both to \nthe images which are the principles of sensing, and to those which are \nthe principles of understanding. For this reason Aristotle (De Anima iii, \n4) held that the intellect by which the soul understands has no innate \nspecies, but is at first in potentiality to all such species.\nBut since that which has a form actually, is sometimes unable to act \naccording to that form on account of some hindrance, as a light thing may \nbe hindered from moving upwards; for this reason did Plato hold that \nnaturally man's intellect is filled with all intelligible species, but \nthat, by being united to the body, it is hindered from the realization of \nits act. But this seems to be unreasonable. First, because, if the soul \nhas a natural knowledge of all things, it seems impossible for the soul \nso far to forget the existence of such knowledge as not to know itself to \nbe possessed thereof: for no man forgets what he knows naturally; that, \nfor instance, the whole is larger than the part, and such like.

Secondly, the \nfalseness of this opinion is clearly proved from the fact that if a sense \nbe wanting, the knowledge of what is apprehended through that sense is \nwanting also: for instance, a man who is born blind can have no knowledge \nof colors.

And for this reason, as we have said above (Article [1]), he referred \nsciences and definitions to those ideas.\nBut since it is contrary to the nature of sensible things that their \nforms should subsist without matter, as Aristotle proves in many ways \n(Metaph. vi), Avicenna (De Anima v) setting this opinion aside, held that \nthe intelligible species of all sensible things, instead of subsisting in \nthemselves without matter, pre-exist immaterially in the separate \nintellects: from the first of which, said he, such species are derived by \na second, and so on to the last separate intellect which he called the \n\"active intelligence,\" from which, according to him, intelligible species \nflow into our souls, and sensible species into corporeal matter. And so \nAvicenna agrees with Plato in this, that the intelligible species of our \nintellect are derived from certain separate forms; but these Plato held \nto subsist of themselves, while Avicenna placed them in the \"active \nintelligence.\" They differ, too, in this respect, that Avicenna held that \nthe intelligible species do not remain in our intellect after it has \nceased actually to understand, and that it needs to turn (to the active \nintellect) in order to receive them anew. Consequently he does not hold \nthat the soul has innate knowledge, as Plato, who held that the \nparticipated ideas remain immovably in the soul.\nBut in this opinion no sufficient reason can be assigned for the soul \nbeing united to the body. For it cannot be said that the intellectual \nsoul is united to the body for the sake of the body: for neither is form \nfor the sake of matter, nor is the mover for the sake of the moved, but \nrather the reverse. Especially does the body seem necessary to the \nintellectual soul, for the latter's proper operation which is to \nunderstand: since as to its being the soul does not depend on the body. \nBut if the soul by its very nature had an inborn aptitude for receiving \nintelligible species through the influence of only certain separate \nprinciples, and were not to receive them from the senses, it would not \nneed the body in order to understand: wherefore to no purpose would it be \nunited to  the body.\nBut if it be said that our soul needs the senses in order to understand, \nthrough being in some way awakened by them to the consideration of those \nthings, the intelligible species of which it receives from the separate \nprinciples: even this seems an insufficient explanation. For this \nawakening does not seem necessary to the soul, except in as far as it is \novercome by sluggishness, as the Platonists expressed it, and by \nforgetfulness, through its union with the body: and thus the senses would \nbe of no use to the intellectual soul except for the purpose of removing \nthe obstacle which the soul encounters through its union with the body. \nConsequently the reason of the union of the soul with the body still \nremains to be sought.\nAnd if it be said with Avicenna, that the senses are necessary to the \nsoul, because by them it is aroused to turn to the \"active intelligence\" \nfrom which it receives the species: neither is this a sufficient \nexplanation. Because if it is natural for the soul to understand through \nspecies derived from the \"active intelligence,\" it follows that at times \nthe soul of an individual wanting in one of the senses can turn to the \nactive intelligence, either from the inclination of its very nature, or \nthrough being roused by another sense, to the effect of receiving the \nintelligible species of which the corresponding sensible species are \nwanting. And thus a man born blind could have knowledge of colors; which \nis clearly untrue. We must therefore conclude that the intelligible \nspecies, by which our soul understands, are not derived from separate \nforms.",
        "RP1": "The intelligible species which are participated by our \nintellect are reduced, as to their first cause, to a first principle \nwhich is by its essence intelligible---namely, God. But they proceed from \nthat principle by means of the sensible forms and material things, from \nwhich we gather knowledge, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii).",

        "OB3": "Further, the eternal types are nothing else but ideas, for \nAugustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 46) that \"ideas are permanent types existing \nin the Divine mind.\" If therefore we say that the intellectual soul knows \nall things in the eternal types, we come back to the opinion of Plato who \nsaid that all knowledge is derived from them.",

        "ANS": "As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 11): \"If those \nwho are called philosophers said by chance anything that was true and \nconsistent with our faith, we must claim it from them as from unjust \npossessors. For some of the doctrines of the heathens are spurious \nimitations or superstitious inventions, which we must be careful to avoid \nwhen we renounce the society of the heathens.\" Consequently whenever \nAugustine, who was imbued with the doctrines of the Platonists, found in \ntheir teaching anything consistent with faith, he adopted it: and those \nthing which he found contrary to faith he amended. Now Plato held, as we \nhave said above (Article [4]), that the forms of things subsist of themselves \napart from matter; and these he called ideas, by participation of which \nhe said that our intellect knows all things: so that just as corporeal \nmatter by participating the idea of a stone becomes a stone, so our \nintellect, by participating the same idea, has knowledge of a stone. But \nsince it seems contrary to faith that forms of things themselves, outside \nthe things themselves and apart from matter, as the Platonists held, \nasserting that \"per se\" life or \"per se\" wisdom are creative substances, \nas Dionysius relates (Div. Nom. xi); therefore Augustine (Questions. 83, qu. \n46), for the ideas defended by Plato, substituted the types of all \ncreatures existing in the Divine mind, according to which types all \nthings are made in themselves, and are known to the human soul.\nWhen, therefore, the question is asked: Does the human soul know all \nthings in the eternal types? we must reply that one thing is said to be \nknown in another in two ways. First, as in an object  itself known; as \none may see in a mirror the images of things reflected therein. In this \nway the soul, in the present state of life, cannot see all things in the \neternal types; but the blessed who see God, and all things in Him, thus \nknow all things in the eternal types. Secondly, on thing is said to be \nknown in another as in a principle of knowledge: thus we might say that \nwe see in the sun what we see by the sun. And thus we must needs say that \nthe human soul knows all things in the eternal types, since by \nparticipation of these types we know all things. For the intellectual \nlight itself which is in us, is nothing else than a participated likeness \nof the uncreated light, in which are contained the eternal types. Whence \nit is written (Ps. 4:6,7), \"Many say: Who showeth us good things?\" which \nquestion the Psalmist answers, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is \nsigned upon us,\" as though he were to say: By the seal of the Divine \nlight in us, all things are made known to us.\nBut since besides the intellectual light which is in us, intelligible \nspecies, which are derived from things, are required in order for us to \nhave knowledge of material things; therefore this same knowledge is not \ndue merely to a participation of the eternal types, as the Platonists \nheld, maintaining that the mere participation of ideas sufficed for \nknowledge. Wherefore Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 16): \"Although the \nphilosophers prove by convincing arguments that all things occur in time \naccording to the eternal types, were they able to see in the eternal \ntypes, or to find out from them how many kinds of animals there are and \nthe origin of each? Did they not seek for this information from the story \nof times and places?\"\nBut that Augustine did not understand all things to be known in their \n\"eternal types\" or in the \"unchangeable truth,\" as though the eternal \ntypes themselves were seen, is clear from what he says (Questions. 83, qu. \n46)---viz. that \"not each and every rational soul can be said to be \nworthy of that vision,\" namely, of the eternal types, \"but only those \nthat are holy and pure,\" such as the souls of the blessed.\nFrom what has been said the objections are easily solved."

First, because \"whatever the bodily senses reach, \nis continually being changed; and what is never the same cannot be \nperceived.\" Secondly, because, \"whatever we perceive by the body, even \nwhen not present to the senses, may be present to the imagination, as \nwhen we are asleep or angry: yet we cannot discern by the senses, whether \nwhat we perceive be the sensible object or the deceptive image thereof. \nNow nothing can be perceived which cannot be distinguished from its  \ncounterfeit.\" And so he concludes that we cannot expect to learn the \ntruth from the senses.

        "ANS": "On this point the philosophers held three opinions. For \nDemocritus held that \"all knowledge is caused by images issuing from the \nbodies we think of and entering into our souls,\" as Augustine says in his \nletter to Dioscorus (cxviii, 4). And Aristotle says (De Somn. et Vigil.) \nthat Democritus held that knowledge is cause by a \"discharge of images.\" \nAnd the reason for this opinion was that both Democritus and the other \nearly philosophers did not distinguish between intellect and sense, as \nAristotle relates (De Anima iii, 3). Consequently, since the sense is \naffected by the sensible, they thought that all our knowledge is affected \nby this mere impression brought about by sensible things. Which \nimpression Democritus held to be caused by a discharge of images.\nPlato, on the other hand, held that the intellect is distinct from the \nsenses: and that it is an immaterial power not making use of a corporeal \norgan for its action. And since the incorporeal cannot be affected by the \ncorporeal, he held that intellectual knowledge is not brought about by \nsensible things affecting the intellect, but by separate intelligible \nforms being participated by the intellect, as we have said above (Articles [4],5). Moreover he held that sense is a power operating of itself. \nConsequently neither is sense, since it is a spiritual power, affected by \nthe sensible: but the sensible organs are affected by the sensible, the \nresult being that the soul is in a way roused to form within itself the \nspecies of the sensible. Augustine seems to touch on this opinion (Gen. \nad lit. xii, 24) where he says that the \"body feels not, but the soul \nthrough the body, which it makes use of as a kind of messenger, for \nreproducing within itself what is announced from without.\" Thus according \nto Plato, neither does intellectual knowledge proceed from sensible \nknowledge, nor sensible knowledge exclusively from  sensible things; but \nthese rouse the sensible soul to the sentient act, while the senses rouse \nthe intellect to the act of understanding.\nAristotle chose a middle course. For with Plato he agreed that intellect \nand sense are different. But he held that the sense has not its proper \noperation without the cooperation of the body; so that to feel is not an \nact of the soul alone, but of the \"composite.\" And he held the same in \nregard to all the operations of the sensitive part. Since, therefore, it \nis not unreasonable that the sensible objects which are outside the soul \nshould produce some effect in the \"composite,\" Aristotle agreed with \nDemocritus in this, that the operations of the sensitive part are caused \nby the impression of the sensible on the sense: not by a discharge, as \nDemocritus said, but by some kind of operation. For Democritus maintained \nthat every operation is by way of a discharge of atoms, as we gather from \nDe Gener. i, 8. But Aristotle held that the intellect has an operation \nwhich is independent of the body's cooperation. Now nothing corporeal can \nmake an impression on the incorporeal. And therefore in order to cause \nthe intellectual operation according to Aristotle, the impression caused \nby the sensible does not suffice, but something more noble is required, \nfor \"the agent is more noble than the patient,\" as he says (De Gener. i, \n5). Not, indeed, in the sense that the intellectual operation is effected \nin us by the mere intellectual operation is effected in us by the mere \nimpression of some superior beings, as Plato held; but that the higher \nand more noble agent which he calls the active intellect, of which we \nhave spoken above (Question [79], Articles [3],4) causes the phantasms received from the \nsenses to be actually intelligible, by a process of abstraction.\nAccording to this opinion, then, on the part of the phantasms, \nintellectual knowledge is caused by the senses. But since the phantasms \ncannot of themselves affect the passive intellect, and require to be made \nactually intelligible by the active intellect, it cannot be said that \nsensible knowledge is the total and perfect cause of intellectual \nknowledge, but rather that it is in a way the material cause.",
        "RP1": "Those words of Augustine mean that we must not expect the \nentire truth from the senses. For the light of the active intellect is \nneeded, through which we achieve the unchangeable truth of changeable \nthings, and discern things themselves from their likeness.",
        "RP2": "In this passage Augustine speaks not of intellectual but of \nimaginary knowledge. And since, according to the opinion of Plato, the \nimagination has an operation which belongs to the soul only, Augustine, \nin order to show that corporeal images are impressed on the imagination, \nnot by bodies but by the soul, uses the same argument as Aristotle does \nin proving that the active intellect must be separate, namely, because \n\"the agent is more noble than the patient.\" And without doubt, according \nto the above opinion, in the imagination there must needs  be not only a \npassive but also an active power. But if we hold, according to the \nopinion of Aristotle, that the action of the imagination, is an action of \nthe \"composite,\" there is no difficulty; because the sensible body is \nmore noble than the organ of the animal, in so far as it is compared to \nit as a being in act to a being in potentiality; even as the object \nactually colored is compared to the pupil which is potentially colored. \nIt may, however, be said, although the first impression of the \nimagination is through the agency of the sensible, since \"fancy is \nmovement produced in accordance with sensation\" (De Anima iii, 3), that \nnevertheless there is in man an operation which by synthesis and analysis \nforms images of various things, even of things not perceived by the \nsenses. And Augustine's words may be taken in this sense.",

First of all \nbecause the intellect, being a power that does not make use of a \ncorporeal organ, would in no way be hindered in its act through the \nlesion of a corporeal organ, if for its act there  were not required the \nact of some power that does make use of a corporeal organ. Now sense, \nimagination and the other powers belonging to the sensitive part, make \nuse of a corporeal organ. Wherefore it is clear that for the intellect to \nunderstand actually, not only when it acquires fresh knowledge, but also \nwhen it applies knowledge already acquired, there is need for the act of \nthe imagination and of the other powers. For when the act of the \nimagination is hindered by a lesion of the corporeal organ, for instance \nin a case of frenzy; or when the act of the memory is hindered, as in the \ncase of lethargy, we see that a man is hindered from actually \nunderstanding things of which he had a previous knowledge. Secondly, \nanyone can experience this of himself, that when he tries to understand \nsomething, he forms certain phantasms to serve him by way of examples, in \nwhich as it were he examines what he is desirous of understanding. For \nthis reason it is that when we wish to help someone to understand \nsomething, we lay examples before him, from which he forms phantasms for \nthe purpose of understanding.\nNow the reason of this is that the power of knowledge is proportioned to \nthe thing known. Wherefore the proper object of the angelic intellect, \nwhich is entirely separate from a body, is an intelligible substance \nseparate from a body. Whereas the proper object of the human intellect, \nwhich is united to a body, is a quiddity or nature existing in corporeal \nmatter; and through such natures of visible things it rises to a certain \nknowledge of things invisible. Now it belongs to such a nature to exist \nin an individual, and this cannot be apart from corporeal matter: for \ninstance, it belongs to the nature of a stone to be in an individual \nstone, and to the nature of a horse to be in an individual horse, and so \nforth. Wherefore the nature of a stone or any material thing cannot be \nknown completely and truly, except in as much as it is known as existing \nin the individual. Now we apprehend the individual through the senses and \nthe imagination. And, therefore, for the intellect to understand actually \nits proper object, it must of necessity turn to the phantasms in order to \nperceive the universal nature existing in the individual. But if the \nproper object of our intellect were a separate form; or if, as the \nPlatonists say, the natures of sensible things subsisted apart from the \nindividual; there would be no need for the intellect to turn to the \nphantasms whenever it understands.",

But to know what is in \nindividual matter, not as existing in such matter, is to abstract the \nform from individual matter which is represented by the phantasms. \nTherefore we must needs say that our intellect understands material \nthings by abstracting from the phantasms; and through material things \nthus considered we acquire some knowledge of immaterial things, just as, \non the contrary, angels know material things through the immaterial.\nBut Plato, considering only the immateriality of the human intellect, \nand not its being in a way united to the body, held that the objects of \nthe intellect are separate ideas; and that we understand not by \nabstraction, but by participating things abstract, as stated above (Question [84], Article [1]).",
        "RP1": "Abstraction may occur in two ways: First, by way of \ncomposition and division; thus we may understand that one thing does not \nexist in some other, or that it is separate therefrom. Secondly, by way \nof simple and absolute consideration; thus we understand one thing \nwithout considering the other. Thus for the intellect to abstract one \nfrom another things which are not really abstract from one another, does, \nin the first mode of abstraction, imply falsehood. But, in the second \nmode of abstraction, for the intellect to abstract things which are not \nreally abstract from one another, does not involve falsehood, as clearly \nappears in the case of the senses. For if we understood or said that \ncolor is not in a colored body, or that it is separate from it, there \nwould be error in this opinion or assertion. But if we consider color and \nits properties, without reference to the apple which is colored; or if we \nexpress in word what we thus understand, there is no error in such an \nopinion or assertion, because an apple is not essential to color, and \ntherefore color can be understood independently of the apple. Likewise, \nthe things which belong to the species of a material thing, such as a \nstone, or a man, or a horse, can be thought of apart from the \nindividualizing principles which do not belong to the notion of the \nspecies. This is what we mean by abstracting the universal from the \nparticular, or the intelligible species from the phantasm; that is, by \nconsidering the nature of the species apart from its individual qualities \nrepresented by the phantasms. If, therefore, the intellect is said to be \nfalse when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is, that is so, if \nthe word \"otherwise\" refers to the thing understood; for the intellect  \nis false when it understands a thing otherwise than as it is; and so the \nintellect would be false if it abstracted the species of a stone from its \nmatter in such a way as to regard the species as not existing in matter, \nas Plato held. But it is not so, if the word \"otherwise\" be taken as \nreferring to the one who understands. For it is quite true that the mode \nof understanding, in one who understands, is not the same as the mode of \na thing in existing: since the thing understood is immaterially in the \none who understands, according to the mode of the intellect, and not \nmaterially, according to the mode of a material thing.",
        "RP2": "Some have thought that the species of a natural thing is a \nform only, and that matter is not part of the species. If that were so, \nmatter would not enter into the definition of natural things. Therefore \nit must be said otherwise, that matter is twofold, common, and \"signate\" \nor individual; common, such as flesh and bone; and individual, as this \nflesh and these bones. The intellect therefore abstracts the species of a \nnatural thing from the individual sensible matter, but not from the \ncommon sensible matter; for example, it abstracts the species of man from \n\"this flesh and these bones,\" which do not belong to the species as such, \nbut to the individual (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 10), and need not be \nconsidered in the species: whereas the species of man cannot be \nabstracted by the intellect form \"flesh and bones.\"\nMathematical species, however, can be abstracted by the intellect from \nsensible matter, not only from individual, but also from common matter; \nnot from common intelligible matter, but only from individual matter. For \nsensible matter is corporeal matter as subject to sensible qualities, \nsuch as being cold or hot, hard or soft, and the like: while intelligible \nmatter is substance as subject to quantity. Now it is manifest that \nquantity is in substance before other sensible qualities are. Hence \nquantities, such as number, dimension, and figures, which are the \nterminations of quantity, can be considered apart from sensible \nqualities; and this is to abstract them from sensible matter; but they \ncannot be considered without understanding the substance which is subject \nto the quantity; for that would be to abstract them from common \nintelligible matter. Yet they can be considered apart from this or that \nsubstance; for that is to abstract them from individual intelligible \nmatter. But some things can be abstracted even from common intelligible \nmatter, such as \"being,\" \"unity,\" \"power,\" \"act,\" and the like; all these \ncan exist without matter, as is plain regarding immaterial things. \nBecause Plato failed to consider the twofold kind of abstraction, as \nabove explained (ad 1), he held that all those things which we have \nstated to be abstracted by the intellect, are abstract in reality.",
        "RP3": "Colors, as being in individual corporeal matter, have the \nsame mode of existence as the power of sight: therefore they can impress \ntheir own image on the eye. But phantasms, since they are images of \nindividuals, and exist in corporeal organs, have not the same mode of \nexistence as the human intellect, and therefore have not the power of \nthemselves to make an impression on  the passive intellect. This is done \nby the power of the active intellect which by turning towards the \nphantasm produces in the passive intellect a certain likeness which \nrepresents, as to its specific conditions only, the thing reflected in \nthe phantasm. It is thus that the intelligible species is said to be \nabstracted from the phantasm; not that the identical form which \npreviously was in the phantasm is subsequently in the passive intellect, \nas a body transferred from one place to another.",

        "ANS": "Some have asserted that our intellectual faculties know \nonly the impression made on them; as, for example, that sense is \ncognizant only of the impression made on its own organ. According to this \ntheory, the intellect understands only its own impression, namely, the \nintelligible species which it has received, so that this species is what \nis understood.\nThis is, however, manifestly false for two reasons. First, because the \nthings we understand are the objects of science; therefore if what we \nunderstand is merely the intelligible species in the soul, it would \nfollow that every science would not be concerned with objects outside the \nsoul, but only with the intelligible species within the soul; thus, \naccording to the teaching of the Platonists all science is about ideas, \nwhich they held to be actually understood [*Question [84], Article [1]]. Secondly, it is \nuntrue, because it would lead to the opinion of the ancients who \nmaintained that \"whatever seems, is true\" [*Aristotle, Metaph. iii. 5], \nand that consequently contradictories are true simultaneously. For if the \nfaculty knows its own impression only, it can judge of that only. Now a \nthing seems according to the impression made on the cognitive faculty. \nConsequently the cognitive faculty will always judge of its own \nimpression as such; and so every judgment will be true: for instance, if \ntaste perceived only its own impression, when anyone with a healthy taste \nperceives that honey is sweet, he would judge truly; and if anyone with a \ncorrupt taste perceives that honey is bitter, this would be equally true; \nfor each would judge according to the impression on his taste. Thus every \nopinion would be equally true; in fact, every sort of apprehension.\nTherefore it must be said that the intelligible species is related to \nthe intellect as that by which it understands: which is proved thus. \nThere is a twofold action (Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8), one which remains \nin the agent; for instance, to see and to understand; and another which \npasses into an external object; for instance, to heat and to cut; and \neach of these actions proceeds in virtue of some form. And as the form \nfrom which proceeds an act tending to something external is the likeness \nof the object of the action, as heat in the heater is a likeness of the \nthing heated; so the form from which proceeds an action remaining in the \nagent is the likeness of the object. Hence that by which the sight sees \nis the likeness of the visible thing; and the likeness of the thing \nunderstood, that is, the intelligible species, is the form by which the \nintellect understands. But since the intellect reflects upon itself, by \nsuch reflection it understands both its own act of intelligence, and the \nspecies by which it understands. Thus the intelligible species is that \nwhich is understood secondarily; but that which is primarily understood \nis the object, of which the species is the likeness. This also appears \nfrom the opinion of the  ancient philosophers, who said that \"like is \nknown by like.\" For they said that the soul knows the earth outside \nitself, by the earth within itself; and so of the rest. If, therefore, we \ntake the species of the earth instead of the earth, according to \nAristotle (De Anima iii, 8), who says \"that a stone is not in the soul, \nbut only the likeness of the stone\"; it follows that the soul knows \nexternal things by means of its intelligible species.",
        "RP1": "The thing understood is in the intellect by its own \nlikeness; and it is in this sense that we say that the thing actually \nunderstood is the intellect in act, because the likeness of the thing \nunderstood is the form of the intellect, as the likeness of a sensible \nthing is the form of the sense in act. Hence it does not follow that the \nintelligible species abstracted is what is actually understood; but \nrather that it is the likeness thereof.",
        "RP2": "In these words \"the thing actually understood\" there is a \ndouble implication---the thing which is understood, and the fact that it \nis understood. In like manner the words \"abstract universal\" imply two \nthings, the nature of a thing and its abstraction or universality. \nTherefore the nature itself to which it occurs to be understood, \nabstracted or considered as universal is only in individuals; but that it \nis understood, abstracted or considered as universal is in the intellect. \nWe see something similar to this is in the senses. For the sight sees the \ncolor of the apple apart from its smell. If therefore it be asked where \nis the color which is seen apart from the smell, it is quite clear that \nthe color which is seen is only in the apple: but that it be perceived \napart from the smell, this is owing to the sight, forasmuch as the \nfaculty of sight receives the likeness of color and not of smell. In like \nmanner humanity understood is only in this or that man; but that humanity \nbe apprehended without conditions of individuality, that is, that it be \nabstracted and consequently considered as universal, occurs to humanity \ninasmuch as it is brought under the consideration of the intellect, in \nwhich there is a likeness of the specific nature, but not of the \nprinciples of individuality.",
        "RP3": "There are two operations in the sensitive part. One, in \nregard of impression only, and thus the operation of the senses takes \nplace by the senses being impressed by the sensible. The other is \nformation, inasmuch as the imagination forms for itself an image of an \nabsent thing, or even of something never seen. Both of these operations \nare found in the intellect. For in the first place there is the passion \nof the passive intellect as informed by the intelligible species; and \nthen the passive intellect thus informed forms a definition, or a \ndivision, or a composition, expressed by a word. Wherefore the concept \nconveyed by a word is its definition; and a proposition conveys the \nintellect's division or composition. Words do not therefore signify the \nintelligible species themselves; but that which the intellect forms for \nitself for the purpose of judging of external things."

        "ANS": "In our knowledge there are two things to be considered. \nFirst, that intellectual knowledge in some degree arises from sensible \nknowledge: and, because sense has singular and individual things for its \nobject, and intellect has the universal for its object, it follows that \nour knowledge of the former comes before our knowledge of the latter. \nSecondly, we must consider that our intellect proceeds from a state of \npotentiality to a state of actuality; and every power thus proceeding \nfrom potentiality to actuality comes first to an incomplete act, which is \nthe medium between potentiality and actuality, before accomplishing the \nperfect act. The perfect act of the intellect is complete knowledge, when \nthe object is distinctly and determinately known; whereas the incomplete \nact is imperfect knowledge, when the object is known indistinctly, and as \nit were confusedly. A thing thus imperfectly known, is known partly in \nact and partly in potentiality, and hence the Philosopher says (Phys. i, \n1), that \"what is manifest and certain is known to us at first \nconfusedly; afterwards we know it by distinguishing its principles and \nelements.\" Now it is evident that to know an object that comprises many \nthings, without proper knowledge of each thing contained in it, is to \nknow that thing confusedly. In this way we can have knowledge not only of \nthe universal whole, which contains parts potentially, but also of the \nintegral whole; for each whole can be known confusedly, without its parts \nbeing known. But to know distinctly what is contained in the universal \nwhole is to know the less common, as to \"animal\" indistinctly is to know \nit as \"animal\"; whereas to know \"animal\" distinctly is know it as \n\"rational\" or  \"irrational animal,\" that is, to know a man or a lion: \ntherefore our intellect knows \"animal\" before it knows man; and the same \nreason holds in comparing any more universal idea with the less universal.\nMoreover, as sense, like the intellect, proceeds from potentiality to \nact, the same order of knowledge appears in the senses. For by sense we \njudge of the more common before the less common, in reference both to \nplace and time; in reference to place, when a thing is seen afar off it \nis seen to be a body before it is seen to be an animal; and to be an \nanimal before it is seen to be a man, and to be a man before it seen to \nbe Socrates or Plato; and the same is true as regards time, for a child \ncan distinguish man from not man before he distinguishes this man from \nthat, and therefore \"children at first call men fathers, and later on \ndistinguish each one from the others\" (Phys. i, 1). The reason of this is \nclear: because he who knows a thing indistinctly is in a state of \npotentiality as regards its principle of distinction; as he who knows \n\"genus\" is in a state of potentiality as regards \"difference.\" Thus it is \nevident that indistinct knowledge is midway between potentiality and act.\nWe must therefore conclude that knowledge of the singular and individual \nis prior, as regards us, to the knowledge of the universal; as sensible \nknowledge is prior to intellectual knowledge. But in both sense and \nintellect the knowledge of the more common precedes the knowledge of the \nless common.",
        "RP1": "The universal can be considered in two ways. First, the \nuniversal nature may be considered together with the intention of \nuniversality. And since the intention of universality---viz. the relation \nof one and the same to many---is due to intellectual abstraction, the \nuniversal thus considered is a secondary consideration. Hence it is said \n(De Anima i, 1) that the \"universal animal is either nothing or something \nsecondary.\" But according to Plato, who held that universals are \nsubsistent, the universal considered thus would be prior to the \nparticular, for the latter, according to him, are mere participations of \nthe subsistent universals which he called ideas.\nSecondly, the universal can be considered in the nature itself---for \ninstance, animality or humanity as existing in the individual. And thus \nwe must distinguish two orders of nature: one, by way of generation and \ntime; and thus the imperfect and the potential come first. In this way \nthe more common comes first in the order of nature; as appears clearly in \nthe generation of man and animal; for \"the animal is generated before \nman,\" as the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal ii, 3). The other order \nis the order of perfection or of the intention of nature: for instance, \nact considered absolutely is naturally prior to potentiality, and the \nperfect to the imperfect: thus the less common comes naturally before the \nmore common; as man comes before animal. For the intention of nature does \nnot stop at the generation of animal but goes on to the generation of \nman.",

First, absolutely \nconsidered in itself; and thus nothing prevents the parts being known \nbefore the whole, as stones are known before a house is known. Secondly \nas belonging to a certain whole; and thus we must needs know the whole \nbefore its parts. For we know a house vaguely before we know its \ndifferent parts. So likewise principles of definition are known before \nthe thing defined is known; otherwise the thing defined would not be \nknown at all. But as parts of the definition they are known after.

But if we consider the generic or \nspecific nature itself as existing in the singular, thus in a way it is \nin the nature of a formal principle in regard to the singulars: for the \nsingular is the result of matter, while the idea of species is from the \nform. But the generic nature is compared to the specific nature rather \nafter the fashion of a material principle, because the generic nature is \ntaken from that which is material in a thing, while the idea of species \nis taken from that which is formal: thus the notion of animal is taken \nfrom the sensitive part, whereas the notion of man is taken from the \nintellectual part. Thus it is that the ultimate intention of nature is to \nthe species and not to the individual, or the genus: because the form is \nthe end of generation, while matter is for the sake of the form. Neither \nis it necessary that, as regards us, knowledge of any cause or principle \nshould be secondary: since at times through sensible causes we become \nacquainted with unknown effects, and sometimes conversely."

Sense, however, may be deceived as \nregards common sensible objects, as size or figure; when, for example, it \njudges the sun to be only a foot in diameter, whereas in reality it \nexceeds the earth in size. Much more is sense deceived concerning \naccidental sensible objects, as when it judges that vinegar is honey by \nreason of the color being the same. The reason of this is evident; for \nevery faculty, as such, is \"per se\" directed to its proper object; and \nthings of this kind are always the same. Hence, as long as the faculty \nexists, its judgment concerning its own proper object does not fail. Now \nthe proper object of the intellect is the \"quiddity\" of a material thing; \nand hence, properly speaking, the intellect is not at fault concerning \nthis quiddity; whereas it may go astray as regards the surroundings of \nthe thing in its essence or quiddity, in referring one thing to another, \nas regards composition or division, or also in the process of reasoning. \nTherefore, also in regard to those propositions, which are understood, \nthe intellect cannot err, as in the case of first principles from which \narises infallible truth in the certitude of scientific conclusions.\nThe intellect, however, may be accidentally deceived in the quiddity of \ncomposite things, not by the defect of its organ, for the intellect is a \nfaculty that is independent of an organ; but on the part of the \ncomposition affecting the definition, when, for instance, the definition \nof a thing is false in relation to something else, as the definition of a \ncircle applied to a triangle; or when a definition is false in itself as \ninvolving the composition of things incompatible; as, for instance, to \ndescribe  anything as \"a rational winged animal.\" Hence as regards simple \nobjects not subject to composite definitions we cannot be deceived \nunless, indeed, we understand nothing whatever about them, as is said \nMetaph. ix, Did. viii, 10.",

Now the indivisible is threefold, as is said De \nAnima iii, 6. First, the continuous is indivisible, since actually it is \nundivided, although potentially divisible: and this indivisible is known \nto us before its division, which is a division into parts: because \nconfused knowledge is prior to distinct knowledge, as we have said above \n(Article [3]). Secondly, the indivisible is so called in relation to species, as \nman's reason is something indivisible. This way, also, the indivisible is \nunderstood before its division into logical parts, as we have said above \n(De Anima iii, 6); and again before the intellect disposes and divides by \naffirmation and negation. The reason of this is that both these kinds of \nindivisible are understood by the intellect of itself, as being its \nproper object. The third kind of indivisible is what is altogether \nindivisible, as a point and unity, which cannot be divided either \nactually or potentially.

If, therefore, the human intellect, as the Platonists held, \nbecame actual by participating separate intelligible forms, it would \nunderstand itself by such participation of incorporeal beings. But as in \nthis life our intellect has material and sensible things for its proper \nnatural object, as stated above (Question [84], Article [7]), it understands itself \naccording as it is made actual by the species abstracted from sensible \nthings, through the light of the active intellect, which not only \nactuates the intelligible things themselves, but also, by their \ninstrumentality, actuates the passive intellect. Therefore the intellect \nknows itself not by its essence, but by its act. This happens in two \nways: In the first place, singularly, as when Socrates or Plato perceives \nthat he has an intellectual soul because he perceives that he \nunderstands. In the second place, universally, as when we consider the \nnature of the human mind from knowledge of the intellectual act. It is \ntrue, however, that the judgment and force of this knowledge, whereby we \nknow the nature of the soul, comes to us according to the derivation of \nour intellectual light from the Divine Truth which contains the types of \nall things as above stated (Question [84], Article [5]). Hence Augustine says (De Trin. \nix, 6): \"We gaze on the inviolable truth whence we can as perfectly as \npossible define, not what each man's mind is, but what it ought to be in \nthe light of the eternal types.\" There is, however, a difference between \nthese two kinds of knowledge, and it consists in this, that the mere \npresence of the mind suffices for the first; the mind itself being the \nprinciple of action whereby it perceives itself, and hence it is said to \nknow itself by its own presence. But as regards the second kind of \nknowledge, the mere presence of the mind does not suffice, and there is \nfurther required a careful and subtle inquiry. Hence many are ignorant of \nthe soul's nature, and many have erred about it. So Augustine says (De \nTrin. x, 9), concerning such mental inquiry: \"Let the mind strive not to \nsee itself as if it were absent, but to discern itself as present\"---i.e. \nto know how it differs from other things; which is to know its essence \nand nature.",
        "RP1": "The mind knows itself by means of itself, because at length \nit acquires knowledge of itself, though led thereto by its own act: \nbecause it is itself that it knows since it loves itself, as he says in \nthe same passage. For a thing can be called self-evident in two ways, \neither because we can know it by nothing else except itself, as first \nprinciples are called self-evident; or because it is not accidentally \nknowable, as color is visible of itself, whereas substance is visible by \nits accident.",
        "RP2": "The essence of an angel is an act in the genus of \nintelligible things, and therefore it is both intellect and the thing \nunderstood. Hence an angel apprehends his own essence through itself: not \nso the human mind, which is either altogether in potentiality to \nintelligible things---as is the passive  intellect---or is the act of \nintelligible things abstracted from the phantasms---as is the active \nintellect.",
        "RP3": "This saying of the Philosopher is universally true in every \nkind of intellect. For as sense in act is the sensible in act, by reason \nof the sensible likeness which is the form of sense in act, so likewise \nthe intellect in act is the object understood in act, by reason of the \nlikeness of the thing understood, which is the form of the intellect in \nact. So the human intellect, which becomes actual by the species of the \nobject understood, is itself understood by the same species as by its own \nform. Now to say that in \"things without matter the intellect and what is \nunderstood are the same,\" is equal to saying that \"as regards things \nactually understood the intellect and what is understood are the same.\" \nFor a thing is actually understood in that it is immaterial. But a \ndistinction must be drawn: since the essences of some things are \nimmaterial---as the separate substances called angels, each of which is \nunderstood and understands, whereas there are other things whose essences \nare not wholly immaterial, but only the abstract likenesses thereof. \nHence the Commentator says (De Anima iii) that the proposition quoted is \ntrue only of separate substances; because in a sense it is verified in \ntheir regard, and not in regard of other substances, as already stated \n(Reply OBJ 2)."

Now, it has been said (Article [1]) that nothing is known but as it is \nactual: therefore so far as a habit fails in being a perfect act, it \nfalls short in being of itself knowable, and can be known only by its \nact; thus, for example, anyone knows he has a habit from the fact that he \ncan produce the act proper to that habit; or he may inquire into the \nnature and idea of the habit by considering the act. The first kind of \nknowledge of the habit arises from its being present, for the very fact \nof its presence causes the act whereby it is known.

But if we take things of different orders the axiom is not true: \nfor we may say that health is caused by medicine, but it does not follow \nthat medicine is more desirable than health, for health belongs to the \norder of final causes, whereas medicine belongs to the order of efficient \ncauses. So of two things belonging essentially to the order of the \nobjects of knowledge, the one which is the cause of the other being \nknown, is the more known, as principles are more known than conclusions. \nBut habit as such does not belong to the order of objects of knowledge; \nnor are things known on account of the habit, as on account of an object \nknown, but as on account of a disposition or form whereby the subject \nknows: and therefore the argument does not prove."

This occurs in different ways with different intellects. \nFor there is an intellect, namely, the Divine, which is Its own act of \nintelligence, so that in God the understanding of His intelligence, and \nthe understanding of His Essence, are one and the same act, because His \nEssence is His act of understanding.

Hence \nthe purer the intellect is, so much the more clearly does it perceive the \nintelligible truth of immaterial things.\nBut in Aristotle's opinion, which experience corroborates, our intellect \nin its present state of life has a natural relationship to the natures of \nmaterial things; and therefore it can only understand by turning to the \nphantasms, as we have said above (Question [84], Article [7]). Thus it clearly appears \nthat immaterial substances which do not fall under sense and imagination, \ncannot first and \"per se\" be known by us, according to the mode of \nknowledge which experience proves us to have.\nNevertheless Averroes (Comment. De Anima iii) teaches that in this \npresent life man can in the end arrive at the knowledge of  separate \nsubstances by being coupled or united to some separate substance, which \nhe calls the \"active intellect,\" and which, being a separate substance \nitself, can naturally understand separate substances. Hence, when it is \nperfectly united to us so that by its means we are able to understand \nperfectly, we also shall be able to understand separate substances, as in \nthe present life through the medium of the passive intellect united to \nus, we can understand material things. Now he said that the active \nintellect is united to us, thus. For since we understand by means of both \nthe active intellect and intelligible objects, as, for instance, we \nunderstand conclusions by principles understood; it is clear that the \nactive intellect must be compared to the objects understood, either as \nthe principal agent is to the instrument, or as form to matter. For an \naction is ascribed to two principles in one of these two ways; to a \nprincipal agent and to an instrument, as cutting to the workman and the \nsaw; to a form and its subject, as heating to heat and fire. In both \nthese ways the active intellect can be compared to the intelligible \nobject as perfection is to the perfectible, and as act is to \npotentiality. Now a subject is made perfect and receives its perfection \nat one and the same time, as the reception of what is actually visible \nsynchronizes with the reception of light in the eye. Therefore the \npassive intellect receives the intelligible object and the active \nintellect together; and the more numerous the intelligible objects \nreceived, so much the nearer do we come to the point of perfect union \nbetween ourselves and the active intellect; so much so that when we \nunderstand all the intelligible objects, the active intellect becomes one \nwith us, and by its instrumentality we can understand all things material \nand immaterial. In this he makes the ultimate happiness of man to \nconsist. Nor, as regards the present inquiry, does it matter whether the \npassive intellect in that state of happiness understands separate \nsubstances by the instrumentality of the active intellect, as he himself \nmaintains, or whether (as he says Alexander holds) the passive intellect \ncan never understand separate substances (because according to him it is \ncorruptible), but man understands separate substances by means of the \nactive intellect.\nThis opinion, however, is untrue. First, because, supposing the active \nintellect to be a separate substance, we could not formally understand by \nits instrumentality, for the medium of an agent's formal action consists \nin its form and act, since every agent acts according to its actuality, \nas was said of the passive intellect (Question [70], Article [1]). Secondly, this \nopinion is untrue, because in the above explanation, the active \nintellect, supposing it to be a separate substance, would not be joined \nto us in its substance, but only in its light, as participated in things \nunderstood; and would not extend to the other acts of the active \nintellect so as to enable us to understand immaterial substances; just as \nwhen we see colors set off by the sun, we are not united to the substance \nof the sun so as to act like the sun, but its light only is united to us, \nthat we may see the colors. Thirdly, this opinion is untrue, because \ngranted that, as above explained, the active intellect were united to us \nin substance, still it is not said that it is wholly  so united in regard \nto one intelligible object, or two; but rather in regard to all \nintelligible objects. But all such objects together do not equal the \nforce of the active intellect, as it is a much greater thing to \nunderstand separate substances than to understand all material things. \nHence it clearly follows that the knowledge of all material things would \nnot make the active intellect to be so united to us as to enable us by \nits instrumentality to understand separate substances.\nFourthly, this opinion is untrue, because it is hardly possible for \nanyone in this world to understand all material things: and thus no one, \nor very few, could reach to perfect felicity; which is against what the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. i, 9), that happiness is a \"kind of common good, \ncommunicable to all capable of virtue.\" Further, it is unreasonable that \nonly the few of any species attain to the end of the species.\nFifthly, the Philosopher expressly says (Ethic. i, 10), that happiness \nis \"an operation according to perfect virtue\"; and after enumerating many \nvirtues in the tenth book, he concludes (Ethic. i, 7) that ultimate \nhappiness consisting in the knowledge of the highest things intelligible \nis attained through the virtue of wisdom, which in the sixth chapter he \nhad named as the chief of speculative sciences. Hence Aristotle clearly \nplaces the ultimate felicity of man in the knowledge of separate \nsubstances, obtainable by speculative science; and not by being united to \nthe active intellect as some imagined.\nSixthly, as was shown above (Question [79], Article [4]), the active intellect is not a \nseparate substance; but a faculty of the soul, extending itself actively \nto the same objects to which the passive intellect extends receptively; \nbecause, as is stated (De Anima iii, 5), the passive intellect is \"all \nthings potentially,\" and the active intellect is \"all things in act.\" \nTherefore both intellects, according to the present state of life, extend \nto material things only, which are made actually intelligible by the \nactive intellect, and are received in the passive intellect. Hence in the \npresent state of life we cannot understand separate immaterial substances \nin themselves, either by the passive or by the active intellect.",
        "RP1": "Augustine may be taken to mean that the knowledge of \nincorporeal things in the mind can be gained by the mind itself. This is \nso true that philosophers also say that the knowledge concerning the soul \nis a principle for the knowledge of separate substances.

        "ANS": "The difficulty in solving this question arises from the \nfact that the soul united to the body can understand only by turning to \nthe phantasms, as experience shows. Did this not proceed from the soul's \nvery nature, but accidentally through its being bound up with the body, \nas the Platonists said, the difficulty would vanish; for in that case \nwhen the body was once removed, the soul would at once return to its own \nnature, and would understand intelligible things simply, without turning \nto the phantasms, as is exemplified in the case of other separate \nsubstances. In that case, however, the union of soul and body would not \nbe for the soul's good, for evidently it would understand worse in the \nbody than out of it; but for the good of the body, which would be \nunreasonable, since matter exists on account of the form, and not the \nform for the sake of matter. But if we admit that the nature of the soul \nrequires it to understand by turning to the phantasms, it will seem, \nsince death does not change its nature, that it can then naturally \nunderstand nothing; as the phantasms are wanting to which it may turn.\nTo solve this difficulty we must consider that as nothing acts except so \nfar as it is actual, the mode of action in every agent follows from its \nmode of existence. Now the soul has one mode of being when in the body, \nand another when apart from it, its nature remaining always the same; but \nthis does not mean that its union with the body is an accidental thing, \nfor, on the contrary, such union belongs to its very nature, just as the \nnature of a light object is not changed, when it is in its proper place, \nwhich is natural to it, and outside its proper place, which is beside its \nnature. The soul, therefore, when united to the body, consistently with \nthat mode of existence, has a mode of understanding, by turning to \ncorporeal phantasms, which are in corporeal organs; but when it is \nseparated from the body, it has a mode of understanding, by turning to \nsimply intelligible objects, as is proper to other separate substances. \nHence it is as natural for the soul to understand by turning to the \nphantasms as it is for it to be joined to the body; but to be separated \nfrom the body is not in accordance with its nature, and likewise to \nunderstand without turning to the phantasms is not natural to it; and \nhence it is united to the body in order that it may have an existence and \nan operation suitable to its nature. But here again a difficulty arises. \nFor since nature is  always ordered to what is best, and since it is \nbetter to understand by turning to simply intelligible objects than by \nturning to the phantasms; God should have ordered the soul's nature so \nthat the nobler way of understanding would have been natural to it, and \nit would not have needed the body for that purpose.\nIn order to resolve this difficulty we must consider that while it is \ntrue that it is nobler in itself to understand by turning to something \nhigher than to understand by turning to phantasms, nevertheless such a \nmode of understanding was not so perfect as regards what was possible to \nthe soul. This will appear if we consider that every intellectual \nsubstance possesses intellective power by the influence of the Divine \nlight, which is one and simple in its first principle, and the farther \noff intellectual creatures are from the first principle so much the more \nis the light divided and diversified, as is the case with lines radiating \nfrom the centre of a circle. Hence it is that God by His one Essence \nunderstands all things; while the superior intellectual substances \nunderstand by means of a number of species, which nevertheless are fewer \nand more universal and bestow a deeper comprehension of things, because \nof the efficaciousness of the intellectual power of such natures: whereas \nthe inferior intellectual natures possess a greater number of species, \nwhich are less universal, and bestow a lower degree of comprehension, in \nproportion as they recede from the intellectual power of the higher \nnatures. If, therefore, the inferior substances received species in the \nsame degree of universality as the superior substances, since they are \nnot so strong in understanding, the knowledge which they would derive \nthrough them would be imperfect, and of a general and confused nature. We \ncan see this to a certain extent in man, for those who are of weaker \nintellect fail to acquire perfect knowledge through the universal \nconceptions of those who have a better understanding, unless things are \nexplained to them singly and in detail. Now it is clear that in the \nnatural order human souls hold the lowest place among intellectual \nsubstances. But the perfection of the universe required various grades of \nbeing. If, therefore, God had willed souls to understand in the same way \nas separate substances, it would follow that human knowledge, so far from \nbeing perfect, would be confused and general. Therefore to make it \npossible for human souls to possess perfect and proper knowledge, they \nwere so made that their nature required them to be joined to bodies, and \nthus to receive the proper and adequate knowledge of sensible things from \nthe sensible things themselves; thus we see in the case of uneducated men \nthat they have to be taught by sensible examples.\nIt is clear then that it was for the soul's good that it was united to a \nbody, and that it understands by turning to the phantasms. Nevertheless \nit is possible for it to exist apart from the body, and also to \nunderstand in another way.",
        "RP1": "The Philosopher's words carefully examined will show that \nhe said this on the previous supposition that understanding is a movement \nof body and soul as united, just as  sensation is, for he had not as yet \nexplained the difference between intellect and sense. We may also say \nthat he is referring to the way of understanding by turning to phantasms. \nThis is also the meaning of the second objection.",
        "RP3": "The separated soul does not understand by way of innate \nspecies, nor by species abstracted then, nor only by species retained, \nand this the objection proves; but the soul in that state understands by \nmeans of participated species arising from the influence of the Divine \nlight, shared by the soul as by other separate substances; though in a \nlesser degree. Hence as soon as it ceases to act by turning to corporeal \n(phantasms), the soul turns at once to the superior things; nor is this \nway of knowledge unnatural, for God is the author of the influx of both \nof the light of grace and of the light of nature."

This can be seen by considering the very \nactions from which knowledge arises. For \"habits are like the actions \nwhereby they are acquired\" (Ethic. ii, 1). Now the actions of the \nintellect, by which knowledge is here acquired, are performed by the mind \nturning to the phantasms in the aforesaid sensitive powers.

Now the souls \ndeparted are in a state of separation from the living, both by Divine \norder and by their mode of existence, whilst they are joined to the world \nof incorporeal spiritual substances; and hence they are ignorant of what \ngoes on among us. Whereof Gregory gives the reason thus: \"The dead do not \nknow how the living act, for the life of the spirit is far from the life \nof the flesh; and so, as corporeal things differ from incorporeal in \ngenus, so they are distinct in knowledge\" (Moral. xii). Augustine seems \nto say the same (De Cura pro Mort. xiii), when he asserts that, \"the \nsouls of the dead have no concern in the affairs of the living.\"\nGregory and Augustine, however, seem to be divided in opinion as regards \nthe souls of the blessed in heaven, for Gregory continues the passage \nabove quoted: \"The case of the holy souls is different, for since they \nsee the light of Almighty God, we cannot believe that external things are \nunknown to them.\" But Augustine (De Cura pro Mort. xiii) expressly says: \n\"The dead, even the saints do not know what is done by the living or by \ntheir own children,\" as a gloss quotes on the text, \"Abraham hath not \nknown us\" (Is. 63:16). He confirms this opinion by saying that he was not \nvisited, nor consoled in sorrow by his mother, as when she was alive; and \nhe could not think it possible that she was less kind when in a happier \nstate; and again by the fact that the Lord promised to king Josias that \nhe should die, lest he should see his people's afflictions (4 Kgs. 22:20). Yet Augustine says this in doubt; and premises, \"Let every one \ntake, as he pleases, what I say.\" Gregory, on the other hand, is \npositive, since he says, \"We cannot believe.\" His opinion, indeed, seems \nto be the more probable one---that the souls of the blessed who see God \ndo know all that passes here. For they are equal to the angels, of whom \nAugustine says that they know what happens among those living on earth. \nBut as the souls of the blessed are most perfectly united to Divine \njustice, they do not suffer from sorrow, nor do they interfere in mundane \naffairs, except in accordance with Divine justice.",

Of this \nopinion we have already spoken (Question [47], Article [2]); and so we need say nothing \nabout it here.\nAugustine, however (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24), says that the soul of the \nfirst man was created at the same time as the angels, before the body, \nfor another reason; because he supposes that the body of man, during the \nwork of the six days, was produced, not actually, but only as to some \n\"causal virtues\"; which cannot be said of the soul, because neither was \nit made of any pre-existing corporeal or  spiritual matter, nor could it \nbe produced from any created virtue.

        "RP1": "Although the angels are the ministers of God, as regards \nwhat He does in bodies, yet God does something in bodies beyond the \nangels' power, as, for instance, raising the dead, or  giving sight to \nthe blind: and by this power He formed the body of the first man from the \nslime of the earth. Nevertheless the angels could act as ministers in the \nformation of the body of the first man, in the same way as they will do \nat the last resurrection by collecting the dust.",

But the power of \nheavenly bodies suffices for the production of some imperfect animals \nfrom properly disposed matter: for it is clear that more conditions are \nrequired to produce a perfect than an imperfect thing.",
        "RP3": "The movement of the heavens causes natural changes; but not \nchanges that surpass the order of nature, and are caused by the Divine \nPower alone, as for the dead to be raised to life, or the blind to see: \nlike to which also is the making of man from the slime of the earth.",
        "RP4": "An effect may be said to pre-exist in the causal virtues of \ncreatures, in two ways. First, both in active and in passive \npotentiality, so that not only can it be produced out of pre-existing \nmatter, but also that some pre-existing creature can produce it. \nSecondly, in passive potentiality only; that is, that out of pre-existing \nmatter it can be produced by God. In this sense, according to Augustine, \nthe human body pre-existed in the previous work in their causal virtues."

For since man is the noblest of animals, his body ought to \nbe the best disposed in what is proper to an animal, that is, in sense \nand movement. But some animals have sharper senses and quicker movement \nthan man; thus dogs have a keener smell, and birds a swifter flight. \nTherefore man's body was not aptly disposed.",
        "OB2": "Further, perfect is what lacks nothing. But the human body lacks \nmore than the body of other animals, for these are provided with covering \nand natural arms of defense, in which man is lacking. Therefore the human \nbody is very imperfectly disposed.",

        "ANS": "All natural things were produced by the Divine art, and \nso may be called God's works of art. Now every artist intends to give to \nhis work the best disposition; not absolutely the best, but the best as \nregards the proposed end; and even if this entails some defect, the \nartist cares not: thus, for instance, when man makes himself a saw for \nthe purpose of cutting, he makes it of iron, which is suitable for the \nobject in view; and he does not prefer to make it of glass, though this \nbe a more beautiful material, because this very beauty would be an \nobstacle to the end he has in view. Therefore God gave to each natural \nbeing the best disposition; not absolutely so, but in the view of its \nproper end. This is what the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 7): \"And because \nit is better so, not absolutely, but for each one's substance.\"\nNow the proximate end of the human body is the rational soul and its \noperations; since matter is for the sake of the form, and instruments are \nfor the action of the agent. I say, therefore, that God fashioned the \nhuman body in that disposition which was best, as most suited to such a \nform and to such operations. If defect exists in the disposition of the \nhuman body, it is well to observe that such defect arises as a necessary \nresult of the matter, from the conditions required in the body, in order \nto make it suitably proportioned to the soul and its operations.",
        "RP1": "The sense of touch, which is the foundation of the other \nsenses, is more perfect in man than in any other animal; and for this \nreason man must have the most equable temperament of all animals. \nMoreover man excels all other animals in the interior sensitive powers, \nas is clear from what we have said above (Question [78], Article [4]). But by a kind of \nnecessity, man falls short of the other animals in some of the exterior \nsenses; thus of all animals he has the least sense of smell. For man \nneeds the largest brain as compared to the body; both for his greater \nfreedom of action in the interior powers required for the intellectual \noperations, as we have seen above (Question [84], Article [7]); and in order that the \nlow temperature of the brain may modify the heat of the heart, which has \nto be considerable in man for him to be able to stand erect. So that size \nof the brain, by reason of its humidity, is an impediment to the smell, \nwhich requires dryness. In the same way, we may suggest a reason why some \nanimals have a keener sight, and a more acute hearing than man; namely, \non account of a hindrance to his senses arising necessarily from the \nperfect equability of his temperament. The same reason suffices to \nexplain why some animals are more rapid in movement than man, since this \nexcellence of speed is inconsistent with the equability of the human \ntemperament.",

Therefore such things do not suit the nature of man. Instead \nof these, he has reason and hands whereby he can make himself arms and \nclothes, and other necessaries of life, of infinite variety. Wherefore \nthe hand is called by  Aristotle (De Anima iii, 8), \"the organ of \norgans.\" Moreover this was more becoming to the rational nature, which is \ncapable of conceiving an infinite number of things, so as to make for \nitself an infinite number of instruments.",
        "RP3": "An upright stature was becoming to man for four reasons. \nFirst, because the senses are given to man, not only for the purpose of \nprocuring the necessaries of life, which they are bestowed on other \nanimals, but also for the purpose of knowledge. Hence, whereas the other \nanimals take delight in the objects of the senses only as ordered to food \nand sex, man alone takes pleasure in the beauty of sensible objects for \nits own sake. Therefore, as the senses are situated chiefly in the face, \nother animals have the face turned to the ground, as it were for the \npurpose of seeking food and procuring a livelihood; whereas man has his \nface erect, in order that by the senses, and chiefly by sight, which is \nmore subtle and penetrates further into the differences of things, he may \nfreely survey the sensible objects around him, both heavenly and earthly, \nso as to gather intelligible truth from all things. Secondly, for the \ngreater freedom of the acts of the interior powers; the brain, wherein \nthese actions are, in a way, performed, not being low down, but lifted up \nabove other parts of the body. Thirdly, because if man's stature were \nprone to the ground he would need to use his hands as fore-feet; and thus \ntheir utility for other purposes would cease. Fourthly, because if man's \nstature were prone to the ground, and he used his hands as fore-feet, he \nwould be obliged to take hold of his food with his mouth. Thus he would \nhave a protruding mouth, with thick and hard lips, and also a hard \ntongue, so as to keep it from being hurt by exterior things; as we see in \nother animals. Moreover, such an attitude would quite hinder speech, \nwhich is reason's proper operation.\nNevertheless, though of erect stature, man is far above plants. For \nman's superior part, his head, is turned towards the superior part of the \nworld, and his inferior part is turned towards the inferior world; and \ntherefore he is perfectly disposed as to the general situation of his \nbody. Plants have the superior part turned towards the lower world, since \ntheir roots correspond to the mouth; and their inferior part towards the \nupper world. But brute animals have a middle disposition, for the \nsuperior part of the animal is that by which it takes food, and the \ninferior part that by which it rids itself of the surplus."

This can be made \nclear if we observe the mode of generation carried out in various living \nthings. Some living things do not possess in themselves the power of \ngeneration, but are generated by some other specific agent, such as some \nplants and animals by the influence of the heavenly bodies, from some \nfitting matter and not from seed: others possess the active and passive \ngenerative power together; as we see in plants which are generated from \nseed; for the noblest vital function in plants is generation. Wherefore \nwe observe that in these the active power of generation invariably \naccompanies the passive power. Among perfect animals the active power of \ngeneration belongs to the male sex, and the passive power to the female. \nAnd as among animals there is a vital operation nobler than generation, \nto which their life is principally directed; therefore the male sex is \nnot found in continual union with the female in perfect animals, but only \nat the time of coition; so that we may consider that by this means the \nmale and female are one, as in plants they are always united; although in \nsome cases one of them preponderates, and in some the other. But man is \nyet further ordered to a still nobler vital action, and that is \nintellectual operation. Therefore there was greater reason for the \ndistinction of these two forces in man; so that the female should be \nproduced separately from the male; although they are carnally united for \ngeneration.

Yet this is of the essence of a perfect image; for in a perfect \nimage nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a \ncopy. Now it is manifest that in man there is some likeness to God, \ncopied from God as from an exemplar; yet this likeness is not one of \nequality, for such an exemplar infinitely excels its copy. Therefore \nthere is in man a likeness to God; not, indeed, a perfect likeness, but \nimperfect.

But each of these trinities falls short of the Divine image. \nFor the species of the external body is extrinsic to the essence of the \nsoul; while the species in the memory, though not extrinsic to the soul, \nis adventitious to it; and thus in both cases the species falls short of \nrepresenting the connaturality and co-eternity of the Divine Persons.

Therefore, first \nand chiefly, the image of the Trinity is to be found in the acts of the \nsoul, that is, inasmuch as from the knowledge which we possess, by actual \nthought we form an internal word; and thence break forth into love. But, \nsince the principles of acts are the habits and powers, and everything \nexists virtually in its principle, therefore, secondarily and \nconsequently, the image of the Trinity may be considered as existing in \nthe powers, and still more in the habits, forasmuch as the acts virtually \nexist therein.",
        "RP1": "Our being bears the image of God so far as if is proper to \nus, and excels that of the other animals, that is to say, in so far as we \nare endowed with a mind. Therefore, this trinity is the same as that \nwhich Augustine mentions (De Trin. ix, 4), and which consists in mind, \nknowledge, and love.",
        "RP2": "Augustine observed this trinity, first, as existing in the \nmind. But because the mind, though it knows itself entirely in a certain \ndegree, yet also in a way does not know itself---namely, as being \ndistinct from others (and thus also it searches itself, as Augustine \nsubsequently proves---De Trin. x, 3,4); therefore, as though knowledge \nwere not in equal proportion to mind, he takes three things in the soul \nwhich are proper to the mind, namely, memory, understanding, and will; \nwhich everyone is conscious of possessing; and assigns the image of the \nTrinity pre-eminently to these three, as though the first assignation \nwere in part deficient.",
        "RP3": "As Augustine proves (De Trin. xiv, 7), we may be said to \nunderstand, will, and to love certain things, both when we actually \nconsider them, and when we do not thing of them. When they are not under \nour actual consideration, they are objects of our memory only, which, in \nhis opinion, is nothing else than habitual retention of knowledge and \nlove [*Cf. Question [79], Article [7], ad 1]. \"But since,\" as he says, \"a word cannot be \nthere without actual thought (for we think everything that we say, even \nif we speak with that interior word belonging to no nation's tongue), \nthis image chiefly consists in these three things, memory, understanding, \nand will. And by  understanding I mean here that whereby we understand \nwith actual thought; and by will, love, or dilection I mean that which \nunites this child with its parent.\" From which it is clear that he places \nthe image of the Divine Trinity more in actual understanding and will, \nthan in these as existing in the habitual retention of the memory; \nalthough even thus the image of the Trinity exists in the soul in a \ncertain degree, as he says in the same place. Thus it is clear that \nmemory, understanding, and will are not three powers as stated in the \nSentences.",
        "RP4": "Someone might answer by referring to Augustine's statement \n(De Trin. xiv, 6), that \"the mind ever remembers itself, ever understands \nitself, ever loves itself\"; which some take to mean that the soul ever \nactually understands, and loves itself. But he excludes this \ninterpretation by adding that \"it does not always think of itself as \nactually distinct from other things.\" Thus it is clear that the soul \nalways understands and loves itself, not actually but habitually; though \nwe might say that by perceiving its own act, it understands itself \nwhenever it understands anything. But since it is not always actually \nunderstanding, as in the case of sleep, we must say that these acts, \nalthough not always actually existing, yet ever exist in their \nprinciples, the habits and powers. Wherefore, Augustine says (De Trin. \nxiv, 4): \"If the rational soul is made to the image of God in the sense \nthat it can make use of reason and intellect to understand and consider \nGod, then the image of God was in the soul from the beginning of its \nexistence.\""

        "ANS": "As above explained (Articles [2],7), image means a likeness \nwhich in some degree, however small, attains to a representation of the \nspecies. Wherefore we need to seek in the image of the Divine Trinity in \nthe soul some kind of representation of species of the Divine Persons, so \nfar as this is possible to a creature. Now the Divine Persons, as above \nstated (Articles [6],7), are distinguished from each other according to the \nprocession of the word from the speaker, and the procession of love from \nboth. Moreover the Word of God is born of God by the knowledge of \nHimself; and Love proceeds from God according as He loves Himself. But it \nis clear that diversity of objects diversifies the species of word and \nlove; for in the human mind the species of a stone is specifically \ndifferent from that of a horse, which also the love regarding each of \nthem is specifically different. Hence we refer the Divine image in man to \nthe verbal concept born of the knowledge of God, and to the love derived \ntherefrom. Thus the image of God is found in the soul according as the \nsoul turns to God, or possesses a nature that enables it to turn to God. \nNow the mind may turn towards an object in two ways: directly and \nimmediately, or indirectly and mediately; as, for instance, when anyone \nsees a man reflected in a looking-glass he may be said to be turned \ntowards that man. So Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 8), the \"the mind \nremembers itself, understands itself, and loves itself. If we perceive \nthis, we perceive a trinity, not, indeed, God, but, nevertheless, rightly \ncalled the image of God.\" But this is due to the fact, not that the mind \nreflects on itself absolutely, but that thereby it can furthermore turn \nto God, as appears from the authority quoted above (Arg. On the contrary).",

But in that part of the reason \nwhich is concerned with temporal things, \"although a trinity may be \nfound; yet the image of God is not to be seen there,\" as he says farther \non; forasmuch as this  knowledge of temporal things is adventitious to \nthe soul. Moreover even the habits whereby temporal things are known are \nnot always present; but sometimes they are actually present, and \nsometimes present only in memory even after they begin to exist in the \nsoul. Such is clearly the case with faith, which comes to us temporally \nfor this present life; while in the future life faith will no longer \nexist, but only the remembrance of faith.",

Wherefore, as the good \ncan be compared to each individual thing both as its preamble, and as \nsubsequent to it, as signifying some perfection in it, so also in the \nsame way there exists a kind of comparison between \"likeness\" and \n\"image.\" For the good is a preamble to man, inasmuch as man is an \nindividual good; and, again, the good is subsequent to man, inasmuch as \nwe may say of a certain man that he is good, by reason of his perfect \nvirtue. In like manner, likeness may be considered in the light of a \npreamble to image, inasmuch as it is something more general than image, \nas we have said above (Article [1]): and, again, it may be considered as \nsubsequent to image, inasmuch as it signifies a certain perfection of \nimage. For we say that an image is like or unlike what it represents, \naccording as the representation is perfect or imperfect.

        "ANS": "The first man did not see God through His Essence if we \nconsider the ordinary state of that life; unless, perhaps, it be said \nthat he saw God in a vision, when \"God cast a deep sleep upon Adam\" (Gn. 2:21). The reason is because, since in the Divine Essence is beatitude \nitself, the intellect of a man who sees the Divine Essence has the same \nrelation to God as a man has to beatitude. Now it is clear that man \ncannot willingly be turned away from beatitude, since naturally and \nnecessarily he desires it, and shuns unhappiness. Wherefore no one who \nsees the Essence of God can willingly turn away from God, which means to \nsin. Hence all who see God through His Essence are so firmly established \nin the love of God, that for eternity they can never sin. Therefore, as \nAdam did sin, it is clear that he did not see God through His Essence.\nNevertheless he knew God with a more perfect knowledge than we do now. \nThus in a sense his knowledge was midway between our knowledge in the \npresent state, and the knowledge we shall have in heaven, when we see God \nthrough His Essence. To make this clear, we must consider that the vision \nof God through His Essence is contradistinguished from the vision of God \nthrough His creatures. Now the higher the creature is, and the more like \nit is to God, the more clearly is God seen in it; for instance, a man is \nseen more clearly through a mirror in which his image is the more clearly \nexpressed. Thus God is seen in a much more perfect manner through His \nintelligible effects than through those which are only sensible or \ncorporeal. But in his present state man is impeded as regards the full \nand clear consideration of intelligible creatures, because he is \ndistracted by and occupied with sensible things. Now, it is written \n(Eccles. 7:30): \"God made man right.\" And man was made right by God in \nthis sense, that in him the lower powers were subjected to the higher, \nand the higher nature was made so as not to be impeded by the lower. \nWherefore the first man was not impeded by exterior things from a clear \nand steady contemplation of the intelligible effects which he perceived \nby the radiation of the first truth, whether by a natural or by a \ngratuitous knowledge. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 33) that, \n\"perhaps God used to speak to the first man as He speaks to the angels; \nby shedding on his mind a ray of the unchangeable truth, yet without \nbestowing on him the experience of which the angels are capable in the \nparticipation of the Divine Essence.\" Therefore, through these \nintelligible effects of God, man knew God then more clearly than we know \nHim now.",

God was seen without this second \nkind of medium, but not without the first kind. For there was no need for \nthe first man to attain to the knowledge of God by demonstration drawn \nfrom an effect, such as we need; since he knew God simultaneously in His \neffects, especially in the intelligible effects, according to His \ncapacity. Again, we must remark that the obscurity which is implied in \nthe word enigma may be of two kinds: first, so far as every creature is \nsomething obscure when compared with the immensity of the Divine light; \nand thus Adam saw God in an enigma, because he saw Him in a created \neffect: secondly, we may take obscurity as an effect of sin, so far as \nman is impeded in the consideration of intelligible things by being \npreoccupied with sensible things; in which sense Adam did not see God in \nan enigma."

Secondly, the state of the soul is \ndistinguished in relation to integrity and corruption, the state of \nnatural existence remaining the same: and thus the state of innocence is \ndistinct from the state of man after sin. For man's soul, in the state of \ninnocence, was adapted to perfect and govern the body; wherefore the \nfirst man is said to have been made into a \"living soul\"; that is, a soul \ngiving life to the body---namely animal life. But he was endowed with \nintegrity as to this life, in that the body was entirely subject to the \nsoul, hindering it in no way, as we have said above (Article [1]). Now it is \nclear from what has been already said (Question [84], Article [7]; Question [85], Article [1]; Question [89], Article [1]) that since the soul is adapted to perfect and govern the body, as \nregards animal life, it is fitting that it should have that mode of \nunderstanding which is by turning to phantasms. Wherefore this mode of \nunderstanding was becoming to the soul of the first man also.\nNow, in virtue of this mode of understanding, there are three degrees of \nmovement in the soul, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). The first is by \nthe soul \"passing from exterior things to concentrate its powers on \nitself\"; the second is by the soul ascending \"so as to be associated with \nthe united superior powers,\" namely the angels; the third is when the \nsoul is \"led on\" yet further \"to the supreme good,\" that is, to God.\nIn virtue of the first movement of the soul from exterior things to \nitself, the soul's knowledge is perfected. This is because the \nintellectual operation of the soul has a natural order to external \nthings, as we have said above (Question [87], Article [3]): and so by the knowledge \nthereof, our intellectual operation can be known perfectly, as an act \nthrough its object. And through the intellectual operation itself, the \nhuman intellect can be known perfectly, as a power through its proper \nact. But in the second movement we do not find perfect knowledge. \nBecause, since the angel does not understand by turning to phantasms, but \nby a far more excellent process, as we have said above (Question [55], Article [2]); the \nabove-mentioned mode of knowledge, by which the soul knows itself, is not \nsufficient to lead it to the knowledge of an angel. Much less does the \nthird movement lead to perfect knowledge: for even the angels themselves, \nby the fact that they know themselves, are not able to arrive at the \nknowledge of the Divine Substance, by reason of its surpassing \nexcellence. Therefore the soul of the first man could not see the angels \nin their essence. Nevertheless he had a more excellent mode of knowledge \nregarding the angels than we possess, because his knowledge of \nintelligible things within him was more certain and fixed than our \nknowledge. And it was on account of this excellence of knowledge that \nGregory says that \"he enjoyed the company of the angelic spirits.\"\nThis makes clear the reply to the first objection.",

For as some perfections, such as clarity, \nwere lacking in the bodily members of the first man, though no evil could \nbe therein; so there could be in his intellect the absence of some \nknowledge, but no false opinion.\nThis is clear also from the very rectitude of the primitive state, by \nvirtue of which, while the soul remained subject to God, the lower \nfaculties in man were subject to the higher, and were no impediment to \ntheir action. And from what has preceded (Question [85], Article [6]), it is clear that \nas regards its proper object the intellect is ever true; and hence it is \nnever deceived of itself; but whatever deception occurs must be ascribed \nto some lower faculty, such as the imagination or the like.

In the state of \ninnocence man could have been a master of men, not in the former but in \nthe latter sense. This distinction is founded on the reason that a slave \ndiffers from a free man in that the latter has the disposal of himself, \nas is stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics, whereas a slave is \nordered to another. So that one man is master of another as his slave \nwhen he refers the one whose master he is, to his own---namely the \nmaster's use. And since every man's proper good is desirable to himself, \nand consequently it is a grievous matter to anyone to yield to another \nwhat ought to be one's own, therefore such dominion implies of necessity \na pain inflicted on the subject; and consequently in the state of \ninnocence such a mastership could not have existed between man and man.\nBut a man is the master of a free subject, by directing him either \ntowards his proper welfare, or to the common good. Such a kind of \nmastership would have existed in the state of innocence between man and \nman, for two reasons. First, because man is naturally a social being, and \nso in the state of innocence he would have led a social life. Now a \nsocial life cannot exist among a number of people unless under the \npresidency of one to look after the common good; for many, as such, seek \nmany things, whereas one attends only to one. Wherefore the Philosopher \nsays, in the beginning of the Politics, that wherever many things are \ndirected to one, we shall always find one at the head directing them. \nSecondly, if one man surpassed another in knowledge and virtue, this \nwould not have been fitting unless these gifts conduced to the benefit of \nothers, according to 1 Pt. 4:10, \"As every man hath received grace, \nministering the same one to another.\" Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. \nDei xix, 14): \"Just men command not by the love of domineering, but by \nthe service of counsel\": and (De Civ.

To understand this, we must observe that \nin the primitive state man possessed, for the preservation of life, two \nremedies, against two defects. One of these defects was the lost of \nhumidity by the action of natural heat, which acts as the soul's \ninstrument: as a remedy against such loss man was provided with food, \ntaken from the other trees of paradise, as now we are provided with the \nfood, which we take for the same purpose. The second defect, as the \nPhilosopher says (De Gener. i, 5), arises from the fact that the humor \nwhich is caused from extraneous sources, being added to the humor already \nexisting, lessens the specific active power: as water added to wine takes \nat first the taste of wine, then, as more water is added, the strength of \nthe wine is diminished, till the wine becomes watery. In like manner, we \nmay observe that at first the active force of the  species is so strong \nthat it is able to transform so much of the food as is required to \nreplace the lost tissue, as well as what suffices for growth; later on, \nhowever, the assimilated food does not suffice for growth, but only \nreplaces what is lost. Last of all, in old age, it does not suffice even \nfor this purpose; whereupon the body declines, and finally dies from \nnatural causes. Against this defect man was provided with a remedy in the \ntree of life; for its effect was to strengthen the force of the species \nagainst the weakness resulting from the admixture of extraneous \nnutriment. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): \"Man had food \nto appease his hunger, drink to slake his thirst; and the tree of life to \nbanish the breaking up of old age\"; and (Questions.

For it is manifest that the greater a \nforce is, the more durable is its effect; therefore, since the power of \nthe tree of life was finite, man's life was to be preserved for a \ndefinite time by partaking of it once; and when that time had elapsed, \nman was to be either transferred to a spiritual life, or had need to eat \nonce more of the tree of life.\nFrom this the replies to the objections clearly appear.

But she is not fitted to help man except in \ngeneration, because another man would have proved a more effective help \nin anything else. Therefore there  would have been such generation also \nin the state of innocence.",
        "ANS": "Some of the earlier doctors, considering the nature of \nconcupiscence as regards generation in our present state, concluded that \nin the state of innocence generation would not have been effected in the \nsame way. Thus Gregory of Nyssa says (De Hom. Opif. xvii) that in \nparadise the human race would have been multiplied by some other means, \nas the angels were multiplied without coition by the operation of the \nDivine Power. He adds that God made man male and female before sin, \nbecause He foreknew the mode of generation which would take place after \nsin, which He foresaw. But this is unreasonable. For what is natural to \nman was neither acquired nor forfeited by sin. Now it is clear that \ngeneration by coition is natural to man by reason of his animal life, \nwhich he possessed even before sin, as above explained (Question [97], Article [3]), \njust as it is natural to other perfect animals, as the corporeal members \nmake it clear. So we cannot allow that these members would not have had a \nnatural use, as other members had, before sin.\nThus, as regards generation by coition, there are, in the present state \nof life, two things to be considered. One, which comes from nature, is \nthe union of man and woman; for in every act of generation there is an \nactive and a passive principle. Wherefore, since wherever there is \ndistinction of sex, the active principle is male and the passive is \nfemale; the order of nature demands that for the purpose of generation \nthere should be concurrence of male and female. The second thing to be \nobserved is a certain deformity of excessive concupiscence, which in the \nstate of innocence would not have existed, when the lower powers were \nentirely subject to reason. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, \n26): \"We must be far from supposing that offspring could not be begotten \nwithout concupiscence. All the bodily members would have been equally \nmoved by the will, without ardent or wanton incentive, with calmness of \nsoul and body.\"",
        "RP1": "In paradise man would have been like an angel in his \nspirituality of mind, yet with an animal life in his body. After the \nresurrection man will be like an angel, spiritualized in soul and body. \nWherefore there is no parallel.",
        "RP2": "As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 4), our first parents \ndid not come together in paradise, because on account of sin they were \nejected from paradise shortly after the creation of the woman; or \nbecause, having received the general Divine command relative to \ngeneration, they awaited the special command relative to time.",
        "RP3": "Beasts are without reason. In this way man becomes, as it \nwere, like them in coition, because he cannot moderate concupiscence. In \nthe state of innocence nothing of this kind would have happened that was \nnot regulated by reason, not because delight of sense was less, as some \nsay (rather indeed would sensible delight have been the greater in \nproportion to the greater  purity of nature and the greater sensibility \nof the body), but because the force of concupiscence would not have so \ninordinately thrown itself into such pleasure, being curbed by reason, \nwhose place it is not to lessen sensual pleasure, but to prevent the \nforce of concupiscence from cleaving to it immoderately. By \n\"immoderately\" I mean going beyond the bounds of reason, as a sober \nperson does not take less pleasure in food taken in moderation than the \nglutton, but his concupiscence lingers less in such pleasures. This is \nwhat Augustine means by the words quoted, which do not exclude intensity \nof pleasure from the state of innocence, but ardor of desire and \nrestlessness of the mind. Therefore continence would not have been \npraiseworthy in the state of innocence, whereas it is praiseworthy in our \npresent state, not because it removes fecundity, but because it excludes \ninordinate desire. In that state fecundity would have been without lust.",
        "RP4": "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): In that state \n\"intercourse would have been without prejudice to virginal integrity; \nthis would have remained intact, as it does in the menses. And just as in \ngiving birth the mother was then relieved, not by groans of pain, but by \nthe instigations of maturity; so in conceiving, the union was one, not of \nlustful desire, but of deliberate action.\""

In like manner the \ntree of the knowledge of good and evil was a material tree, so called in \nview of future events; because, after eating of it, man was to learn, by \nexperience of the consequent punishment, the difference between the good \nof obedience and the evil of rebellion.

        "question": "Whether paradise was a place adapted to be the abode of man?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that paradise was not a place adapted to be the \nabode of man. For man and angels are similarly ordered to beatitude. But \nthe angels from the very beginning of their existence were made to dwell \nin the abode of the blessed---that is, the empyrean heaven. Therefore the \nplace of man's habitation should have been there also.",
        "OB2": "Further, if some definite place were required for man's abode, \nthis would be required on the part either of the soul or of the body. If \non the part of the soul, the place would be in heaven, which is adapted \nto the nature of the soul; since the desire of heaven is implanted in \nall. On the part of the body, there was no need for any other place than \nthe one provided for other animals. Therefore paradise was not at all \nadapted to be the abode of man.",
        "OB3": "Further, a place which contains nothing is useless. But after \nsin, paradise was not occupied by man. Therefore if it were adapted as a \ndwelling-place for man, it seems that God made paradise to no purpose.",
        "OB4": "Further, since man is of an even temperament, a fitting place for \nhim should be of even temperature. But paradise was not of an even \ntemperature; for it is said to have been on the equator---a situation of \nextreme heat, since twice in the year the sun passes vertically over the \nheads of its inhabitants. Therefore paradise was not a fit dwelling-place \nfor man.",
        "CON": "Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): \"Paradise was a \ndivinely ordered region, and worthy of him who was made to God's image.\"",
        "ANS": "As above stated (Question [97], Article [1]), Man was incorruptible and \nimmortal, not because his body had a disposition to incorruptibility, but \nbecause in his soul there was a power preserving the body from \ncorruption. Now the human body may be corrupted from within or from \nwithout. From within, the body is corrupted by the consumption of the \nhumors, and by old age, as above explained (Question [97], Article [4]), and man was \nable to ward off such corruption by food. Among those things which \ncorrupt the body from without, the chief seems to be an atmosphere of \nunequal temperature; and to such corruption a remedy is found in an \natmosphere of equable nature. In paradise both conditions were found; \nbecause, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): \"Paradise was \npermeated with the all pervading brightness of a temperate, pure, and \nexquisite atmosphere, and decked with ever-flowering plants.\" Whence it \nis clear that paradise was most fit to be a dwelling-place for man, and \nin keeping with his original state of immortality.",
        "RP1": "The empyrean heaven is the highest of corporeal places, and \nis outside the region of change. By the first of these two conditions, it \nis a fitting abode for the angelic nature: for, as Augustine says (De \nTrin. ii), \"God rules corporeal creatures through spiritual creatures.\" \nHence it is fitting that the spiritual nature should be established above \nthe entire corporeal nature, as presiding over it. By the second \ncondition, it is a fitting abode for the state of beatitude, which is \nendowed with the highest degree of stability. Thus the abode of beatitude \nwas suited to the very nature of the angel; therefore he was created \nthere. But it is not suited to man's nature, since man is not set as a \nruler over the entire corporeal creation: it is a fitting abode for man \nin regard only to his beatitude. Wherefore he was not placed from the \nbeginning in the empyrean heaven, but was destined to be transferred \nthither in the state of his final beatitude.",
        "RP2": "It is ridiculous to assert that any particular place is \nnatural to the soul or to any spiritual substances, though some \nparticular place may have a certain fitness in regard to spiritual \nsubstances. For the earthly paradise was a place adapted to man, as \nregards both his body and his soul---that is, inasmuch as in his soul was \nthe force which preserved the human body from corruption. This could not \nbe said of the other animals. Therefore, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. \nii, 11): \"No irrational animal inhabited paradise\"; although, by a \ncertain dispensation, the animals were brought thither by God to Adam; \nand the serpent was able to trespass therein by the complicity of the \ndevil.",
        "RP3": "Paradise did not become useless through being unoccupied by \nman after sin, just as immortality was not conferred on man in vain, \nthough he was to lose it. For thereby we learn God's kindness to man, and \nwhat man lost by sin. Moreover, some say  that Enoch and Elias still \ndwell in that paradise.",
        "RP4": "Those who say that paradise was on the equinoctial line are \nof opinion that such a situation is most temperate, on account of the \nunvarying equality of day and night; that it is never too cold there, \nbecause the sun is never too far off; and never too hot, because, \nalthough the sun passes over the heads of the inhabitants, it does not \nremain long in that position. However, Aristotle distinctly says (Meteor. \nii, 5) that such a region is uninhabitable on account of the heat. This \nseems to be more probable; because, even those regions where the sun does \nnot pass vertically overhead, are extremely hot on account of the mere \nproximity of the sun. But whatever be the truth of the matter, we must \nhold that paradise was situated in a most temperate situation, whether on \nthe equator or elsewhere."

        "question": "Whether man was placed in paradise to dress it and keep it?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that man was not placed in paradise to dress and \nkeep it. For what was brought on him as a punishment of sin would not \nhave existed in paradise in the state of innocence. But the cultivation \nof the soil was a punishment of sin (Gn. 3:17). Therefore man was not \nplaced in paradise to dress and keep it.",
        "OB2": "Further, there is no need of a keeper when there is no fear of \ntrespass with violence. But in paradise there was no fear of trespass \nwith violence. Therefore there was no need for man to keep paradise.",
        "OB3": "Further, if man was placed in paradise to dress and keep it, man \nwould apparently have been made for the sake of paradise, and not \ncontrariwise; which seems to be false. Therefore man was not place in \nparadise to dress and keep it.",
        "CON": "It is written (Gn. 2: 15): \"The Lord God took man and \nplaced in the paradise of pleasure, to dress and keep it.\"",
        "ANS": "As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 10), these words in \nGenesis may be understood in two ways. First, in the sense that God \nplaced man in paradise that He might Himself work in man and keep him, by \nsanctifying him (for if this work cease, man at once relapses into \ndarkness, as the air grows dark when the light ceases to shine); and by \nkeeping man from all corruption and evil. Secondly, that man might dress \nand keep paradise, which dressing would not have involved labor, as it \ndid after sin; but would have been pleasant on account of man's practical \nknowledge of the powers of nature. Nor would man have kept paradise \nagainst a trespasser; but he would have striven to keep paradise for \nhimself lest he should lose it by sin. All of which was for man's good; \nwherefore paradise was ordered to man's benefit, and not conversely.\nWhence the Replies to the Objections are made clear."
