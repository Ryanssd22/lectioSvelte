        "question": "Whether the object of faith is the First Truth?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that the object of faith is not the First Truth. \nFor it seems that the object of faith is that which is proposed to us to \nbe believed. Now not only things pertaining to the Godhead, i.e. the \nFirst Truth, are proposed to us to be believed, but also things \nconcerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of the Church, and \nthe condition of creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the \nFirst Truth.",
        "OB2": "Further, faith and unbelief have the same object since they are \nopposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things contained in \nHoly Writ, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is considered an \nunbeliever. Therefore faith also is about all things contained in Holy \nWrit. But there are many things therein, concerning man and other \ncreatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the First Truth, but \nalso created truth.",
        "OB3": "Further, faith is condivided with charity, as stated above (FS, \nQuestion [62], Article [3]). Now by charity we love not only God, who is  the sovereign \nGood, but also our neighbor. Therefore the object of Faith is not only \nthe First Truth.",
        "CON": "Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that \"faith is about the \nsimple and everlasting truth.\" Now this is the First Truth. Therefore the \nobject of faith is the First Truth.",
        "ANS": "The object of every cognitive habit includes two things: \nfirst, that which is known materially, and is the material object, so to \nspeak, and, secondly, that whereby it is known, which is the formal \naspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the conclusions \nare what is known materially, while the formal aspect of the science is \nthe mean of demonstration, through which the conclusions are known.\nAccordingly if we consider, in faith, the formal aspect of the object, \nit is nothing else than the First Truth. For the faith of which we are \nspeaking, does not assent to anything, except because it is revealed by \nGod. Hence the mean on which faith is based is the Divine Truth. If, \nhowever, we consider materially the things to which faith assents, they \ninclude not only God, but also many other things, which, nevertheless, do \nnot come under the assent of faith, except as bearing some relation to \nGod, in as much as, to wit, through certain effects of the Divine \noperation, man is helped on his journey towards the enjoyment of God. \nConsequently from this point of view also the object of faith is, in a \nway, the First Truth, in as much as nothing comes under faith except in \nrelation to God, even as the object of the medical art is health, for it \nconsiders nothing save in relation to health.",
        "RP1": "Things concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments \nof the Church, or any creatures whatever, come under faith, in so far as \nby them we are directed to God, and in as much as we assent to them on \naccount of the Divine Truth.\nThe same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all things \ncontained in Holy Writ.",

        "question": "Whether the object of faith is something complex, by way of a proposition?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that the object of faith is not something complex \nby way of a proposition. For the object of faith is the First Truth, as \nstated above (Article [1]). Now the First Truth is something simple. Therefore \nthe object of faith is not something complex.",
        "OB2": "Further, the exposition of faith is contained in the symbol. Now \nthe symbol does not contain propositions, but things: for it is not \nstated therein that God is almighty, but: \"I believe  in God . . . \nalmighty.\" Therefore the object of faith is not a proposition but a thing.",
        "OB3": "Further, faith is succeeded by vision, according to 1 Cor. 13:12: \n\"We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now \nI know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known.\" But the object \nof the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is the Divine Essence. \nTherefore the faith of the wayfarer is also.",
        "CON": "Faith is a mean between science and opinion. Now the \nmean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science and \nopinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is likewise about \npropositions; so that its object is something complex.",
        "ANS": "The thing known is in the knower according to the mode of \nthe knower. Now the mode proper to the human intellect is to know the \ntruth by synthesis and analysis, as stated in the FP, Question [85], Article [5]. Hence \nthings that are simple in themselves, are known by the intellect with a \ncertain amount of complexity, just as on the other hand, the Divine \nintellect knows, without any complexity, things that are complex in \nthemselves.\nAccordingly the object of faith may be considered in two ways. First, as \nregards the thing itself which is believed, and thus the object of faith \nis something simple, namely the thing itself about which we have faith. \nSecondly, on the part of the believer, and in this respect the object of \nfaith is something complex by way of a proposition.\nHence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount of \ntruth.",
        "RP1": "This argument considers the object of faith on the part of \nthe thing believed.",
        "RP2": "The symbol mentions the things about which faith is, in so \nfar as the act of the believer is terminated in them, as is evident from \nthe manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the believer does not \nterminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as in science we do not \nform propositions, except in order to have knowledge about things through \ntheir means, so is it in faith.",
        "RP3": "The object of the heavenly vision will be the First Truth \nseen in itself, according to 1 Jn. 3:2: \"We know that when He shall \nappear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as He is\": \nhence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way of a \nsimple understanding. On the other hand, by faith, we do not apprehend \nthe First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison fails."

        "question": "Whether anything false can come under faith?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that something false can come under faith. For \nfaith is condivided with hope and charity. Now something false can come \nunder hope, since many hope to have eternal life, who will not obtain it. \nThe same may be said of charity, for many are loved as being good, who, \nnevertheless, are not good. Therefore something false can be the object \nof faith.",
        "OB2": "Further, Abraham believed that Christ would be born, according to \nJn. 8:56: \"Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see My day: he saw \nit, and was glad.\" But after the time of Abraham, God might not have \ntaken flesh, for it was merely because He willed that He did, so that \nwhat Abraham believed about Christ would have been false. Therefore the \nobject of faith can be something false.",
        "OB3": "Further, the ancients believed in the future birth of Christ, and \nmany continued so to believe, until they heard the preaching of the \nGospel. Now, when once Christ was born, even before He began to preach, \nit was false that Christ was yet to be born. Therefore something false \ncan come under faith.",
        "OB4": "Further, it is a matter of faith, that one should believe that \nthe true Body of Christ is contained in the Sacrament of the altar. But \nit might happen that the bread was not rightly consecrated, and that \nthere was not Christ's true Body there, but only bread. Therefore \nsomething false can come under faith.",
        "CON": "No virtue that perfects the intellect is related to the \nfalse, considered as the evil of the intellect, as the Philosopher \ndeclares (Ethic. vi, 2). Now faith is a virtue that perfects the \nintellect, as we shall show further on (Question [4], Articles [2],5). Therefore nothing \nfalse can come under it.",
        "ANS": "Nothing comes under any power, habit or act, except by \nmeans of the formal aspect of the object: thus color cannot be seen \nexcept by means of light, and a conclusion cannot be known save through \nthe mean of demonstration. Now it has been stated (Article [1]) that the formal \naspect of the object of faith is the First Truth; so that nothing can \ncome under faith, save in so far as it stands under the First Truth, \nunder which nothing false can stand, as neither can non-being stand under \nbeing, nor evil under goodness. It follows therefore that nothing false \ncan come under faith.",
        "RP1": "Since the true is the good of the intellect, but not of the \nappetitive power, it follows that all virtues which perfect the \nintellect, exclude the false altogether, because it belongs to the nature \nof a virtue to bear relation to the good alone. On the other hand those \nvirtues which perfect the appetitive faculty, do not entirely exclude the \nfalse, for it is possible to act in accordance with justice or \ntemperance, while having a false opinion about what one is doing. \nTherefore, as faith perfects the intellect, whereas hope and charity \nperfect the appetitive part,  the comparison between them fails.\nNevertheless neither can anything false come under hope, for a man hopes \nto obtain eternal life, not by his own power (since this would be an act \nof presumption), but with the help of grace; and if he perseveres therein \nhe will obtain eternal life surely and infallibly.\nIn like manner it belongs to charity to love God, wherever He may be; so \nthat it matters not to charity, whether God be in the individual whom we \nlove for God's sake.",
        "RP2": "That \"God would not take flesh,\" considered in itself was \npossible even after Abraham's time, but in so far as it stands in God's \nforeknowledge, it has a certain necessity of infallibility, as explained \nin the FP, Question [14], Articles [13],15: and it is thus that it comes under faith. \nHence in so far as it comes under faith, it cannot be false.",
        "RP3": "After Christ's birth, to believe in Him, was to believe in \nChrist's birth at some time or other. The fixing of the time, wherein \nsome were deceived was not due to their faith, but to a human conjecture. \nFor it is possible for a believer to have a false opinion through a human \nconjecture, but it is quite impossible for a false opinion to be the \noutcome of faith.",
        "RP4": "The faith of the believer is not directed to such and such \naccidents of bread, but to the fact that the true body of Christ is under \nthe appearances of sensible bread, when it is rightly consecrated. Hence \nif it be not rightly consecrated, it does not follow that anything false \ncomes under faith."

        "OB2": "Further, the Apostle, while speaking of the knowledge of faith, \nsays (1 Cor. 13:12): \"We see now through a glass in a dark manner.\" \nTherefore what is believed is seen.",

        "ANS": "Faith implies assent of the intellect to that which is \nbelieved. Now the intellect assents to a thing in two ways. First, \nthrough being moved to assent by its very object, which is known either \nby itself (as in the case of first principles, which are held by the \nhabit of understanding), or through something else already known (as in \nthe case of conclusions which are held by the habit of science). Secondly \nthe intellect assents to something, not through being sufficiently moved \nto this assent by its proper object, but through an act of choice, \nwhereby it turns voluntarily to one side rather than to the other: and if \nthis be accompanied by doubt or fear of the opposite side, there will be \nopinion, while, if there be certainty and no fear of the other side, \nthere will be faith.\nNow those things are said to be seen which, of themselves, move the \nintellect or the senses to knowledge of them. Wherefore it is evident \nthat neither faith nor opinion can be of things seen either by the senses \nor by the intellect.",

        "OB1": "It would seem that those things that are of faith can be an \nobject of science. For where science is lacking there is ignorance, since \nignorance is the opposite of science. Now we are not in ignorance of \nthose things we have to believe, since ignorance of such things savors of \nunbelief, according to 1 Tim. 1:13: \"I did it ignorantly in unbelief.\" \nTherefore things that are  of faith can be an object of science.",
        "OB2": "Further, science is acquired by reasons. Now sacred writers \nemploy reasons to inculcate things that are of faith. Therefore such \nthings can be an object of science.",
        "OB3": "Further, things which are demonstrated are an object of science, \nsince a \"demonstration is a syllogism that produces science.\" Now certain \nmatters of faith have been demonstrated by the philosophers, such as the \nExistence and Unity of God, and so forth. Therefore things that are of \nfaith can be an object of science.",
        "OB4": "Further, opinion is further from science than faith is, since \nfaith is said to stand between opinion and science. Now opinion and \nscience can, in a way, be about the same object, as stated in Poster. i. \nTherefore faith and science can be about the same object also.",
        "CON": "Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that \"when a thing \nis manifest, it is the object, not of faith, but of perception.\" \nTherefore things that are of faith are not the object of perception, \nwhereas what is an object of science is the object of perception. \nTherefore there can be no faith about things which are an object of \nscience.",
        "ANS": "All science is derived from self-evident and therefore \n\"seen\" principles; wherefore all objects of science must needs be, in a \nfashion, seen.\nNow as stated above (Article [4]), it is impossible that one and the same thing \nshould be believed and seen by the same person. Hence it is equally \nimpossible for one and the same thing to be an object of science and of \nbelief for the same person. It may happen, however, that a thing which is \nan object of vision or science for one, is believed by another: since we \nhope to see some day what we now believe about the Trinity, according to \n1 Cor. 13:12: \"We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face \nto face\": which vision the angels possess already; so that what we \nbelieve, they see. In like manner it may happen that what is an object of \nvision or scientific knowledge for one man, even in the state of a \nwayfarer, is, for another man, an object of faith, because he does not \nknow it by demonstration.\nNevertheless that which is proposed to be believed equally by all, is \nequally unknown by all as an object of science: such are the things which \nare of faith simply. Consequently faith and science are not about the \nsame things.",
        "RP1": "Unbelievers are in ignorance of things that are of faith, \nfor neither do they see or know them in themselves, nor do they know them \nto be credible. The faithful, on the other hand, know them, not as by \ndemonstration, but by the light of faith which makes them see that they \nought to believe them, as stated above  (Article [4], ad 2,3).",
        "RP2": "The reasons employed by holy men to prove things that are \nof faith, are not demonstrations; they are either persuasive arguments \nshowing that what is proposed to our faith is not impossible, or else \nthey are proofs drawn from the principles of faith, i.e. from the \nauthority of Holy Writ, as Dionysius declares (Div. Nom. ii). Whatever is \nbased on these principles is as well proved in the eyes of the faithful, \nas a conclusion drawn from self-evident principles is in the eyes of all. \nHence again, theology is a science, as we stated at the outset of this \nwork (FP, Question [1], Article [2]).",
        "RP3": "Things which can be proved by demonstration are reckoned \namong the articles of faith, not because they are believed simply by all, \nbut because they are a necessary presupposition to matters of faith, so \nthat those who do not known them by demonstration must know them first of \nall by faith.",

For it is \npossible for the same person, about one and the same object, to know one \nthing and to think another: and, in like manner, one may know by \ndemonstration the unity of the Godhead, and, by faith, the Trinity. On \nthe other hand, in one and the same man, about the same object, and in \nthe same respect, science is incompatible with either opinion or faith, \nyet for different reasons. Because science is incompatible with opinion \nabout the same object simply, for the reason that science demands that \nits object should be deemed impossible to be otherwise, whereas it is \nessential to opinion, that its object should be deemed possible to be \notherwise. Yet that which is the object of faith, on account of the \ncertainty of faith, is also deemed impossible to be otherwise; and the \nreason why science and faith cannot be about the same object and in the \nsame respect is because the object of science is something seen whereas \nthe object of faith is the unseen, as stated above."

But these, by reason of their multitude, cannot be \nreduced to a certain number. Therefore it seems superfluous to \ndistinguish certain articles of faith.",
        "OB2": "Further, material differences can be multiplied indefinitely, and \ntherefore art should take no notice of them. Now  the formal aspect of \nthe object of faith is one and indivisible, as stated above (Article [1]), viz. \nthe First Truth, so that matters of faith cannot be distinguished in \nrespect of their formal object. Therefore no notice should be taken of a \nmaterial division of matters of faith into articles.",
        "OB3": "Further, it has been said by some [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa \nAurea] that \"an article is an indivisible truth concerning God, exacting \n[arctans] our belief.\" Now belief is a voluntary act, since, as Augustine \nsays (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), \"no man believes against his will.\" \nTherefore it seems that matters of faith should not be divided into \narticles.",
        "CON": "Isidore says: \"An article is a glimpse of Divine truth, \ntending thereto.\" Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine truth by way of \nanalysis, since things which in God are one, are manifold in our \nintellect. Therefore matters of faith should be divided into articles.",
        "ANS": "the word \"article\" is apparently derived from the Greek; \nfor the Greek {arthron} [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] which the \nLatin renders \"articulus,\" signifies a fitting together of distinct \nparts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are \ncalled the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar, \narticles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their \ngender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit \ntogether in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is \ncomposed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: \"Your \npassion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes.\"\nHence matters of Christian faith are said to contain distinct articles, \nin so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together. Now the \nobject of faith is something unseen in connection with God, as stated \nabove (Article [4]). Consequently any matter that, for a special reason, is \nunseen, is a special article; whereas when several matters are known or \nnot known, under the same aspect, we are not to distinguish various \narticles. Thus one encounters one difficulty in seeing that God suffered, \nand another in seeing that He rose again from the dead, wherefore the \narticle of the Resurrection is distinct from the article of the Passion. \nBut that He suffered, died and was buried, present the same difficulty, \nso that if one be accepted, it is not difficult to accept the others; \nwherefore all these belong to one article.",
        "RP1": "Some things are proposed to our belief are in themselves of \nfaith, while others are of faith, not in themselves but only in relation \nto others: even as in sciences certain propositions are put forward on \ntheir own account, while others are put forward in order to manifest \nothers. Now, since the chief object of faith consists in those things \nwhich we hope to see, according to Heb. 11:2: \"Faith is the substance of \nthings to be hoped for,\" it follows that those things are in themselves \nof faith, which order us directly to eternal life. Such are the  Trinity \nof Persons in Almighty God [*The Leonine Edition reads: The Three \nPersons, the omnipotence of God, etc.], the mystery of Christ's \nIncarnation, and the like: and these are distinct articles of faith. On \nthe other hand certain things in Holy Writ are proposed to our belief, \nnot chiefly on their own account, but for the manifestation of those \nmentioned above: for instance, that Abraham had two sons, that a dead man \nrose again at the touch of Eliseus' bones, and the like, which are \nrelated in Holy Writ for the purpose of manifesting the Divine mystery or \nthe Incarnation of Christ: and such things should not form distinct \narticles.",
        "RP2": "The formal aspect of the object of faith can be taken in \ntwo ways: first, on the part of the thing believed, and thus there is one \nformal aspect of all matters of faith, viz. the First Truth: and from \nthis point of view there is no distinction of articles. Secondly, the \nformal aspect of matters of faith, can be considered from our point of \nview; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of faith is that it is \nsomething unseen; and from this point of view there are various distinct \narticles of faith, as we saw above.",
        "RP3": "This definition of an article is taken from an etymology of \nthe word as derived from the Latin, rather than in accordance with its \nreal meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it does not carry much \nweight. Yet even then it could be said that although faith is exacted of \nno man by a necessity of coercion, since belief is a voluntary act, yet \nit is exacted of him by a necessity of end, since \"he that cometh to God \nmust believe that He is,\" and \"without faith it is impossible to please \nGod,\" as the Apostle declares (Heb. 11:6)."

Among these principles there is a certain order, so that \nsome are contained implicitly in others; thus all principles are reduced, \nas to their first principle, to this one: \"The same thing cannot be \naffirmed and denied at the same time,\" as the Philosopher states (Metaph. \niv, text. 9). In like manner all the articles are contained implicitly in \ncertain primary matters of faith, such as God's existence, and His \nprovidence over the salvation of man, according to Heb. 11: \"He that \ncometh to God, must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that \nseek Him.\" For the existence of God includes all that we believe to exist \nin God eternally, and in these our happiness consists; while belief in \nHis providence includes all those things which God dispenses in time, for \nman's salvation, and which are the way to that happiness: and in this \nway, again, some of those articles which follow from these are contained \nin others: thus faith in the Redemption of mankind includes belief in the \nIncarnation of Christ, His Passion and so forth.\nAccordingly we must conclude that, as regards the substance of the \narticles of faith, they have not received any increase as time went on: \nsince whatever those who lived later have believed, was contained, albeit \nimplicitly, in the faith of those Fathers who preceded them. But there \nwas an increase in the number of articles believed explicitly, since to \nthose who lived in later times some were known explicitly which were not \nknown explicitly by those who lived before them. Hence the Lord said to \nMoses (Ex. 6:2,3): \"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of \nJacob [*Vulg.: 'I am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to \nJacob'] . . . and My name Adonai I did not show them\": David also said \n(Ps. 118:100): \"I have had understanding above ancients\": and the Apostle \nsays (Eph. 3:5) that the mystery of Christ, \"in other generations was not \nknown, as it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets.\"",

Hence the Apostle says (Heb. 11:13): \"All these died according to faith, not having received the \npromises, but beholding them afar off.\" Now the further off a thing is \nthe less distinctly is it seen; wherefore those who were nigh to Christ's \nadvent had a more distinct knowledge of the good things to be hoped for.",

Hence it is written (Jn. 17:3): \"This is eternal life: that they \nmay know Thee, the . . . true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent.\" \nWherefore the first distinction in matters of faith is that some concern \nthe  majesty of the Godhead, while others pertain to the mystery of \nChrist's human nature, which is the \"mystery of godliness\" (1 Tim. 3:16).\nNow with regard to the majesty of the Godhead, three things are proposed \nto our belief: first, the unity of the Godhead, to which the first \narticle refers; secondly, the trinity of the Persons, to which three \narticles refer, corresponding to the three Persons; and thirdly, the \nworks proper to the Godhead, the first of which refers to the order of \nnature, in relation to which the article about the creation is proposed \nto us; the second refers to the order of grace, in relation to which all \nmatters concerning the sanctification of man are included in one article; \nwhile the third refers to the order of glory, and in relation to this \nanother article is proposed to us concerning the resurrection of the dead \nand life everlasting. Thus there are seven articles referring to the \nGodhead.\nIn like manner, with regard to Christ's human nature, there are seven \narticles, the first of which refers to Christ's incarnation or \nconception; the second, to His virginal birth; the third, to His Passion, \ndeath and burial; the fourth, to His descent into hell; the fifth, to His \nresurrection; the sixth, to His ascension; the seventh, to His coming for \nthe judgment, so that in all there are fourteen articles.\nSome, however, distinguish twelve articles, six pertaining to the \nGodhead, and six to the humanity.

Since, however, with regard to each Person, certain points have \nto be observed, about which some happen to fall into error, looking at it \nin this way, we may distinguish three articles about the three Persons. \nFor Arius believed in the omnipotence and eternity of the Father, but did \nnot believe the Son to be co-equal and consubstantial with the Father; \nhence the need for an article about the Person of the Son in order to \nsettle this point.

Hence scientific consideration \nmay be meritorious if it be referred to the end of charity, i.e. to the \nhonor of God or the good of our neighbor. On the other hand, in the case \nof faith, both these things are subject to the free-will so that in both \nrespects the act of faith can be meritorious: whereas in the case of \nopinion, there is no firm assent, since it is weak and infirm, as the \nPhilosopher observes (Poster. i, 33), so that it does not seem to proceed \nfrom a perfect act of the will: and for this reason, as regards the \nassent, it does not appear to be very meritorious, though it can be as \nregards the actual consideration.",

In this sense it has been said above (FS, Question [24], Article [3], ad 1; Question [77], Article [6], ad 2) that, in moral virtues, a passion which precedes \nchoice makes the virtuous act less praiseworthy. For just as a man ought \nto perform acts of moral virtue, on account of the judgment of his \nreason, and not on account of a passion, so ought he to believe matters \nof faith, not on account of human reason, but on account of the Divine \nauthority. Secondly, human reasons may be consequent to the will of the \nbeliever. For when a man's will is ready to believe, he loves the truth \nhe believes, he thinks out and takes to heart whatever reasons he can \nfind in support thereof; and in this way human reason does not exclude \nthe merit of faith but is a sign of greater merit. Thus again, in moral \nvirtues a consequent passion is the sign of a more prompt will, as stated \nabove (FS, Question [24], Article [3], ad 1). We have an indication of this in the words \nof the Samaritans to the woman, who is a type of human reason: \"We now \nbelieve, not for thy saying\" (Jn. 4:42).",

On the other hand, though demonstrative reasons in \nsupport of the preambles of faith [*The Leonine Edition reads: 'in \nsupport of matters of faith which are however, preambles to the articles \nof faith, diminish,' etc.], but not of the articles of faith, diminish \nthe measure of faith, since they make the thing believed to be seen, yet \nthey do not diminish the measure of charity, which makes the will ready \nto believe them, even if they were unseen; and so the measure of merit  \nis not diminished.",
        "RP3": "Whatever is in opposition to faith, whether it consist in a \nman's thoughts, or in outward persecution, increases the merit of faith, \nin so far as the will is shown to be more prompt and firm in believing. \nHence the martyrs had more merit of faith, through not renouncing faith \non account of persecution; and even the wise have greater merit of faith, \nthrough not renouncing their faith on account of the reasons brought \nforward by philosophers or heretics in opposition to faith. On the other \nhand things that are favorable to faith, do not always diminish the \npromptness of the will to believe, and therefore they do not always \ndiminish the merit of faith."

        "CON": "The authority of the Apostle suffices.",
        "ANS": "Though some say that the above words of the Apostle are \nnot a definition of faith, yet if we consider the matter aright, this \ndefinition overlooks none of the points in reference to which faith can \nbe defined, albeit the words themselves are not arranged in the form of a \ndefinition, just as the philosophers touch on the principles of the \nsyllogism, without employing the syllogistic form.\nIn order to make this clear, we must observe that since habits are known \nby their acts, and acts by their objects, faith, being a  habit, should \nbe defined by its proper act in relation to its proper object. Now the \nact of faith is to believe, as stated above (Question [2], Articles [2],3), which is an \nact of the intellect determinate to one object of the will's command. \nHence an act of faith is related both to the object of the will, i.e. to \nthe good and the end, and to the object of the intellect, i.e. to the \ntrue. And since faith, through being a theological virtues, as stated \nabove (FS, Question [62], Article [2]), has one same thing for object and end, its \nobject and end must, of necessity, be in proportion to one another. Now \nit has been already stated (Question [1], Articles [1],4) that the object of faith is \nthe First Truth, as unseen, and whatever we hold on account thereof: so \nthat it must needs be under the aspect of something unseen that the First \nTruth is the end of the act of faith, which aspect is that of a thing \nhoped for, according to the Apostle (Rm. 8:25): \"We hope for that which \nwe see not\": because to see the truth is to possess it. Now one hopes not \nfor what one has already, but for what one has not, as stated above (FS, \nQuestion [67], Article [4]). Accordingly the relation of the act of faith to its end \nwhich is the object of the will, is indicated by the words: \"Faith is the \nsubstance of things to be hoped for.\" For we are wont to call by the name \nof substance, the first beginning of a thing, especially when the whole \nsubsequent thing is virtually contained in the first beginning; for \ninstance, we might say that the first self-evident principles are the \nsubstance of science, because, to wit, these principles are in us the \nfirst beginnings of science, the whole of which is itself contained in \nthem virtually. In this way then faith is said to be the \"substance of \nthings to be hoped for,\" for the reason that in us the first beginning of \nthings to be hoped for is brought about by the assent of faith, which \ncontains virtually all things to be hoped for. Because we hope to be made \nhappy through seeing the unveiled truth to which our faith cleaves, as \nwas made evident when we were speaking of happiness (FS, Question [3], Article [8]; FS, \nQuestion [4], Article [3]).\nThe relationship of the act of faith to the object of the intellect, \nconsidered as the object of faith, is indicated by the words, \"evidence \nof things that appear not,\" where \"evidence\" is taken for the result of \nevidence. For evidence induces the intellect to adhere to a truth, \nwherefore the firm adhesion of the intellect to the non-apparent truth of \nfaith is called \"evidence\" here. Hence another reading has \"conviction,\" \nbecause to wit, the intellect of the believer is convinced by Divine \nauthority, so as to assent to what it sees not. Accordingly if anyone \nwould reduce the foregoing words to the form of a definition, he may say \nthat \"faith is a habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, \nmaking the intellect assent to what is non-apparent.\"\nIn this way faith is distinguished from all other things pertaining to \nthe intellect. For when we describe it as \"evidence,\" we distinguish it \nfrom opinion, suspicion, and doubt, which do not make the intellect \nadhere to anything firmly; when we go on to say, \"of things that appear \nnot,\" we distinguish it from science and understanding, the object of \nwhich is something apparent; and when we say that it is \"the substance of \nthings to be hoped for,\" we distinguish the virtue of faith from faith \ncommonly so called,  which has no reference to the beatitude we hope for.\nWhatever other definitions are given of faith, are explanations of this \none given by the Apostle. For when Augustine says (Tract. xl in Joan.: \nQuestions. Evang. ii, qu. 39) that \"faith is a virtue whereby we believe what we \ndo not see,\" and when Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 11) that \"faith \nis an assent without research,\" and when others say that \"faith is that \ncertainty of the mind about absent things which surpasses opinion but \nfalls short of science,\" these all amount to the same as the Apostle's \nwords: \"Evidence of things that appear not\"; and when Dionysius says \n(Div. Nom. vii) that \"faith is the solid foundation of the believer, \nestablishing him in the truth, and showing forth the truth in him,\" comes \nto the same as \"substance of things to be hoped for.\"",
        "RP1": "\"Substance\" here does not stand for the supreme genus \ncondivided with the other genera, but for that likeness to substance \nwhich is found in each genus, inasmuch as the first thing in a genus \ncontains the others virtually and is said to be the substance thereof.",

Theol. iii, 64] have said \nthat living and lifeless faith are indeed distinct habits, but that, all \nthe same, when living faith comes the habit of lifeless faith is not \ntaken away, and that it remains together with the habit of living faith \nin the same subject. Yet again it seems unreasonable that the habit of \nlifeless faith should remain inactive in a person having living faith.\nWe must therefore hold differently that living and lifeless faith are \none and the same habit. The reason is that a habit is  differentiated by \nthat which directly pertains to that habit. Now since faith is a \nperfection of the intellect, that pertains directly to faith, which \npertains to the intellect. Again, what pertains to the will, does not \npertain directly to faith, so as to be able to differentiate the habit of \nfaith. But the distinction of living from lifeless faith is in respect of \nsomething pertaining to the will, i.e. charity, and not in respect of \nsomething pertaining to the intellect. Therefore living and lifeless \nfaith are not distinct habits.",
        "RP1": "The saying of the Apostle refers to those imperfect things \nfrom which imperfection is inseparable, for then, when the perfect comes \nthe imperfect must needs be done away. Thus with the advent of clear \nvision, faith is done away, because it is essentially \"of the things that \nappear not.\" When, however, imperfection is not inseparable from the \nimperfect thing, the same identical thing which was imperfect becomes \nperfect. Thus childhood is not essential to man and consequently the same \nidentical subject who was a child, becomes a man. Now lifelessness is not \nessential to faith, but is accidental thereto as stated above. Therefore \nlifeless faith itself becomes living.",
        "RP2": "That which makes an animal live is inseparable from an \nanimal, because it is its substantial form, viz. the soul: consequently a \ndead thing cannot become a living thing, and a living and a dead thing \ndiffer specifically. On the other hand that which gives faith its form, \nor makes it live, is not essential to faith. Hence there is no comparison.",
        "RP3": "Grace causes faith not only when faith begins anew to be in \na man, but also as long as faith lasts. For it has been said above (FP, \nQuestion [104], Article [1]; FS, Question [109], Article [9]) that God is always working man's \njustification, even as the sun is always lighting up the air. Hence grace \nis not less effective when it comes to a believer than when it comes to \nan unbeliever: since it causes faith in both, in the former by confirming \nand perfecting it, in the latter by creating it anew.\nWe might also reply that it is accidental, namely on account of the \ndisposition of the subject, that grace does not cause faith in one who \nhas it already: just as, on the other hand, a second mortal sin does not \ntake away grace from one who has already lost it through a previous \nmortal sin.",
        "RP4": "When living faith becomes lifeless, faith is not changed, \nbut its subject, the soul, which at one time has faith without charity, \nand at another time, with charity."

Now lifeless faith is common to all members of the Church, \nbecause its lifelessness is not part of its substance, if we consider it \nas a gratuitous gift.

Again, the last end must of necessity be present \nto the intellect before it is present to the will, since the will has no \ninclination for anything except in so far as it is apprehended by the \nintellect. Hence, as the last end is present in the will by hope and \ncharity, and in the intellect, by faith, the first of all the virtues \nmust, of necessity, be faith, because natural knowledge cannot reach God \nas the object of heavenly bliss, which is the aspect under which hope and \ncharity tend towards Him.\nOn the other hand, some virtues can precede faith accidentally. For an \naccidental cause precedes its effect accidentally. Now that which removes \nan obstacle is a kind of accidental cause, according to the Philosopher \n(Phys. viii, 4): and in this sense certain virtues may be said to precede \nfaith accidentally, in so far as they remove obstacles to belief. Thus \nfortitude removes the inordinate fear that hinders faith; humility \nremoves pride, whereby a man refuses to submit himself to the truth of \nfaith. The same may be said of some other virtues, although there are no \nreal virtues, unless faith be presupposed, as Augustine states (Contra \nJulian. iv, 3).\nThis suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.",

In another \nway, obedience denotes an inclination to fulfil the commandments \nconsidered as a duty.

Now the principal \nobject of faith is the First Truth, the sight of which gives the \nhappiness of heaven and takes the place of faith. Consequently, as the \nangels before their confirmation in grace, and man before sin, did not \npossess the happiness whereby God is seen in His Essence, it is evident \nthat the knowledge they possessed was not such as to exclude faith.\nIt follows then, that the absence of faith in them could only be \nexplained by their being altogether ignorant of the object of faith.

Thus if a prophet, while preaching the word \nof God, were to foretell something, and were to give a sign, by raising a \ndead person to life, the intellect of a witness would be convinced so as \nto recognize clearly that God, Who lieth not, was speaking, although the \nthing itself foretold would not be evident in itself, and consequently \nthe essence of faith would not be removed.\nAccordingly we must say that faith is commended in the first sense in \nthe faithful of Christ: and in this way faith is not in the demons, but \nonly in the second way, for they see many evident signs, whereby they \nrecognize that the teaching of the Church is from God, although they do \nnot see the things themselves that the Church teaches, for instance that \nthere are three Persons in God, and so forth.",

To some [*William of Auxerre, Sum. \nAur.

For dulness is contrary to sharpness, since \nan intellect is said, by comparison, to be sharp, when it is able to \npenetrate into the heart of the things that are  proposed to it. Hence it \nis dulness of mind that renders the mind unable to pierce into the heart \nof a thing. A man is said to be a fool if he judges wrongly about the \ncommon end of life, wherefore folly is properly opposed to wisdom, which \nmakes us judge aright about the universal cause. Ignorance implies a \ndefect in the mind, even about any particular things whatever, so that it \nis contrary to knowledge, which gives man a right judgment about \nparticular causes, viz. about creatures.

On the other hand, it is praiseworthy to \ndispute about the faith in order to confute errors, or for practice.\nOn the part of the hearers we must consider whether those who hear the \ndisputation are instructed and firm in the faith, or simple and wavering. \nAs to those who are well instructed and firm in the faith, there can be \nno danger in disputing about the faith in their presence.

In the first case it is necessary to dispute in \npublic about the faith, provided there be those who are equal and adapted \nto the task of confuting errors; since in this way simple people are \nstrengthened in the faith, and unbelievers are deprived of the \nopportunity to deceive, while if those who ought to withstand the \nperverters of the truth of faith were silent, this would tend to \nstrengthen error. Hence Gregory says (Pastor. ii, 4): \"Even as a \nthoughtless speech gives rise to error, so does an indiscreet silence \nleave those in error who might have been instructed.\" On the other hand, \nin the second case it is dangerous to dispute in public about the faith, \nin the presence of simple people, whose faith for this very reason is \nmore firm, that they have never heard anything differing from what they \nbelieve.

Hence the \nApostle forbade the faithful to go to law before an unbelieving judge. \nAnd so the Church altogether forbids unbelievers to acquire dominion over \nbelievers, or to have authority over them in any capacity whatever.\nSecondly, we may speak of dominion or authority, as already in force: \nand here we must observe that dominion and authority are institutions of \nhuman law, while the distinction between faithful and unbelievers arises \nfrom the Divine law. Now the Divine law which is the law of grace, does \nnot do away with human law which is the law of natural reason. Wherefore \nthe distinction between faithful and unbelievers, considered in itself, \ndoes not do away with dominion and authority of unbelievers over the \nfaithful.\nNevertheless this right of dominion or authority can be justly done away \nwith by the sentence or ordination of the Church who has the authority of \nGod: since unbelievers in virtue of their unbelief deserve to forfeit \ntheir power over the faithful who are converted into children of God.\nThis the Church does sometimes, and sometimes not. For among those \nunbelievers who are subject, even in temporal matters, to the Church and \nher members, the Church made the law that if the slave of a Jew became a \nChristian, he should forthwith receive his freedom, without paying any \nprice, if he should be a \"vernaculus,\"  i.e. born in slavery; and \nlikewise if, when yet an unbeliever, he had been bought for his service: \nif, however, he had been bought for sale, then he should be offered for \nsale within three months. Nor does the Church harm them in this, because \nsince those Jews themselves are subject to the Church, she can dispose of \ntheir possessions, even as secular princes have enacted many laws to be \nobserved by their subjects, in favor of liberty. On the other hand, the \nChurch has not applied the above law to those unbelievers who are not \nsubject to her or her members, in temporal matters, although she has the \nright to do so: and this, in order to avoid scandal, for as Our Lord \nshowed (Mt. 17:25,26) that He could be excused from paying the tribute, \nbecause \"the children are free,\" yet He ordered the tribute to be paid in \norder to avoid giving scandal.

Now it was never the custom of the \nChurch to baptize the children of the Jews against the will of their \nparents, although at times past there have been many very powerful \ncatholic princes like Constantine and Theodosius, with whom most holy \nbishops have been on most friendly terms, as Sylvester with Constantine, \nand Ambrose with Theodosius, who would certainly not have failed to \nobtain this favor from them if it had been at all reasonable. It seems \ntherefore hazardous to repeat this assertion, that the children of Jews \nshould be baptized against their parents' wishes, in contradiction to the \nChurch's custom observed hitherto.\nThere are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger \nto the faith. For children baptized before coming to the use of reason, \nafterwards when they come to perfect age, might easily be persuaded by \ntheir parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this \nwould be detrimental to the faith.\nThe other reason is that it is against natural justice. For a child is \nby nature part of its father: thus, at first, it is not distinct from its \nparents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within its mother's \nwomb; and later on after birth, and before it has the use of its \nfree-will, it is enfolded in the care of its parents, which is like a \nspiritual womb, for so long as man has not the use of reason, he differs \nnot from an irrational animal; so that even as an ox or a horse belongs \nto someone who, according to the civil law, can use them when he likes, \nas his own instrument, so, according to the natural law, a son, before \ncoming to the use of reason, is under his father's care. Hence it would \nbe contrary to natural justice, if a child, before coming to the use of \nreason, were to be taken away from its parents' custody, or anything done \nto it against its parents' wish. As soon, however, as it begins to have \nthe use of its free-will, it begins to belong to itself, and is able to \nlook after itself, in matters concerning the Divine or the natural law, \nand then it should be induced, not by compulsion but by persuasion, to \nembrace the faith: it can then consent to the faith, and be baptized, \neven against its parents' wish; but not before it comes to the use of \nreason. Hence it is said of the children of the fathers of old that they \nwere saved in the faith of their parents; whereby we are given to \nunderstand that it is the parents' duty to look after the salvation of \ntheir children, especially before they come to the use of reason.",
        "RP1": "In the marriage bond, both husband and wife have the use of \nthe free-will, and each can assent to the faith without the other's \nconsent. But this does not apply to a child before it comes to the use of \nreason: yet the comparison holds good after the child has come to the use \nof reason, if it is willing to be converted.",
        "RP2": "No one should be snatched from natural death against the \norder of civil law: for instance, if a man were condemned by the judge to \ntemporal death, nobody ought to rescue him by violence: hence no one \nought to break the order of the  natural law, whereby a child is in the \ncustody of its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of \neverlasting death.",

Again, good is twofold: one is spiritual, \nnamely the health of the soul, which good is chiefly the object of \ncharity, since it is this chiefly that we should wish for one another. \nConsequently, from this point of view, heretics who return after falling \nno matter how often, are admitted by the Church to Penance whereby the \nway of salvation is opened to them.\nThe other good is that which charity considers secondarily, viz. \ntemporal good, such as life of the body, worldly possessions, good \nrepute, ecclesiastical or secular dignity, for we are not bound by \ncharity to wish others this good, except in relation to the eternal \nsalvation of them and of others. Hence if the presence of one of these \ngoods in one individual might be an obstacle to eternal salvation in \nmany, we are not bound out of charity to wish such a good to that person, \nrather should we desire him to be without it, both because eternal \nsalvation takes precedence of temporal good, and because the good of the \nmany is to be preferred to the good of one. Now if heretics were always \nreceived on their return, in order to save their lives and other temporal \ngoods, this might be prejudicial to the salvation of others, both because \nthey would infect others if they relapsed again, and because, if they \nescaped without punishment, others would feel more assured in lapsing \ninto heresy.

Now the Jews began by speaking \nblasphemy against the Son of Man, when they said (Mt. 11:19) that He was \n\"a glutton . . . a wine drinker,\" and a \"friend of publicans\": but \nafterwards they blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, when they ascribed to \nthe prince of devils those works which Christ did by the power of His own \nDivine Nature and by the operation of the Holy Ghost.\nAugustine, however (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi), says that blasphemy or \nthe sin against the Holy Ghost, is final impenitence when, namely, a man \nperseveres in mortal sin until death, and that it is not confined to \nutterance by word of mouth, but extends to words in thought and deed, not \nto one word only, but to many. Now this word, in this sense, is said to \nbe uttered against the Holy Ghost, because it is contrary to the \nremission of sins, which is the work of the Holy Ghost, Who is the \ncharity both of the Father and of the Son. Nor did Our Lord say this to \nthe Jews, as though they had sinned against the Holy Ghost, since they \nwere not yet guilty of final impenitence, but He warned them, lest by \nsimilar utterances they should come to sin against the Holy Ghost: and it \nis in this sense that we are to understand Mark 3:29,30, where after Our \nLord had said: \"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost,\" etc. \nthe Evangelist adds, \"because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.\"\nBut others understand it differently, and say that the sin of blasphemy \nagainst the Holy Ghost, is a sin committed against that good which is \nappropriated to the Holy Ghost: because goodness is appropriated to the \nHoly Ghost, just a power is appropriated to the Father, and wisdom to the \nSon. Hence they say that when a man sins through weakness, it is a sin \n\"against the Father\"; that when he sins through ignorance, it is a sin \n\"against the Son\"; and that when he sins through certain malice, i.e. \nthrough the very choosing of evil, as explained above (FS, Question [78], Articles [1],3), it is a sin \"against the Holy Ghost.\"\nNow this may happen in two ways. First by reason of the very inclination \nof a vicious habit which we call malice, and, in this way, to sin through \nmalice is not the same as to sin against the Holy Ghost. In another way \nit happens that by reason of contempt, that which might have prevented \nthe choosing of evil, is rejected or removed; thus hope is removed by \ndespair, and fear by presumption, and so on, as we shall explain further \non (Questions [20],21).

        "ANS": "According to the various interpretations of the sin \nagainst the Holy Ghost, there are various ways in which it may be said \nthat it cannot be forgiven. For if by the sin against the Holy Ghost we \nunderstand final impenitence, it is said to be unpardonable, since in no \nway is it pardoned: because the mortal sin wherein a man perseveres until \ndeath will not be forgiven in the life to come, since it was not remitted \nby repentance in this life.\nAccording to the other two interpretations, it is said to be \nunpardonable, not as though it is nowise forgiven, but because, \nconsidered in itself, it deserves not to be pardoned: and this in two \nways. First, as regards the punishment, since he that sins through \nignorance or weakness, deserves less punishment, whereas he that sins \nthrough certain malice, can offer no excuse in alleviation of his \npunishment. Likewise those who blasphemed against the Son of Man before \nHis Godhead was revealed, could have some excuse, on account of the \nweakness of the flesh which they perceived in Him, and hence, they \ndeserved less punishment; whereas those who blasphemed against His very \nGodhead, by ascribing to the devil the works of the Holy Ghost, had no \nexcuse in diminution of their punishment. Wherefore, according to \nChrysostom's commentary (Hom. xlii in Matth.), the Jews are said not to \nbe forgiven this sin, neither in this world nor in the world to come, \nbecause they were punished for it, both in the present life, through the \nRomans, and in the life to come, in the pains of hell. Thus also \nAthanasius adduces the example of their forefathers who, first of all, \nwrangled with Moses on account of the shortage of water and bread; and \nthis the Lord bore with patience, because they were to be excused on \naccount of the weakness of the flesh: but afterwards they sinned more \ngrievously when, by ascribing to an idol the favors bestowed by God Who \nhad brought them out of Egypt, they blasphemed, so to speak, against the \nHoly Ghost, saying (Ex. 32:4): \"These are thy gods, O Israel, that have \nbrought thee out of the land of Egypt.\" Therefore the Lord both inflicted \ntemporal punishment on them, since \"there were slain on that day about \nthree and twenty thousand men\" (Ex. 32:28), and threatened them with  \npunishment in the life to come, saying, (Ex. 32:34): \"I, in the day of \nrevenge, will visit this sin . . . of theirs.\"\nSecondly, this may be understood to refer to the guilt: thus a disease \nis said to be incurable in respect of the nature of the disease, which \nremoves whatever might be a means of cure, as when it takes away the \npower of nature, or causes loathing for food and medicine, although God \nis able to cure such a disease. So too, the sin against the Holy Ghost is \nsaid to be unpardonable, by reason of its nature, in so far as it removes \nthose things which are a means towards the pardon of sins. This does not, \nhowever, close the way of forgiveness and healing to an all-powerful and \nmerciful God, Who, sometimes, by a miracle, so to speak, restores \nspiritual health to such men.",

Secondly, one may sin through certain malice, by \ncontemptuously rejecting the things whereby a man is withdrawn from sin. \nThis is, properly speaking, to sin against the Holy Ghost, as stated \nabove (Article [1]); and this also, for the most part, presupposes other sins, \nfor it is written (Prov. 18:3) that \"the wicked man, when he is come into \nthe depth of sins, contemneth.\"\nNevertheless it is possible for a man, in his first sinful act, to sin \nagainst the Holy Ghost by contempt, both on account of his free-will, and \non account of the many previous dispositions, or again, through being \nvehemently moved to evil, while but feebly attached to good.

For such blasphemy as Our Lord \nspeaks of, always proceeds from contemptuous malice.\nIf, however, with Augustine (De Verb.

Hence in corporeal things the \nsenses are said to be acute when they can perceive a sensible object from \nafar, by sight, hearing, or scent, while on the other hand they are said \nto be dull, through being unable to perceive, except sensible objects \nthat are near at hand, or of great power.\nNow, by way of similitude to bodily sense, we speak of sense in \nconnection with the intellect; and this latter sense is in respect of \ncertain primals and extremes, as stated in Ethic. vi, even as the senses \nare cognizant of sensible objects as of certain principles of knowledge. \nNow this sense which is connected with understanding, does not perceive \nits object through a medium of corporeal distance, but through certain \nother media, as, for instance, when it perceives a thing's essence \nthrough a property thereof, and the cause through its effect. \nConsequently a man is said to have an acute sense in connection with his \nunderstanding, if, as soon as he apprehends a property or effect of a \nthing, he understands the nature or the thing itself, and if he can \nsucceed in perceiving its slightest details: whereas a man is said to \nhave a dull sense in connection with his understanding, if he cannot \narrive at knowing the truth about a thing, without many explanations; in \nwhich case, moreover, he is unable to obtain a perfect perception of \neverything pertaining to the nature of that thing.\nAccordingly dulness of sense in connection with understanding denotes a \ncertain weakness of the mind as to the consideration of spiritual goods; \nwhile blindness of mind implies the complete privation of the knowledge \nof such things. Both are opposed to the gift of understanding, whereby a \nman knows spiritual goods by apprehending them, and has a subtle \npenetration of their inmost nature.

On the other hand, the doctrine of \nGod's law is not so bound up with the kingly office, because a king is \nplaced over his people in temporal matters: hence it is especially \ncommanded that the king should be instructed by the priests about things \npertaining to the law of God.",

In like manner we are commanded to \nmeditate on the Law in every action of ours, not that we are bound to be \nalways actually thinking about the Law, but that we should regulate all \nour actions according to it."

        "OB1": "It would seem that hope is not a virtue. For \"no man makes ill \nuse of a virtue,\" as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18). But one may \nmake ill use of hope, since the passion of hope, like the other passions, \nis subject to a mean and extremes. Therefore hope is not a virtue.",
        "OB2": "Further, no virtue results from merits, since \"God works virtue \nin us without us,\" as Augustine states (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. xvii). But \nhope is caused by grace and merits, according to the Master (Sent. iii, \nD, 26). Therefore hope is not a virtue.",
        "OB3": "Further, \"virtue is the disposition of a perfect thing\" (Phys. \nvii, text. 17,18). But hope is the disposition of an imperfect thing, of \none, namely, that lacks what it hopes to have. Therefore hope is not a \nvirtue.",
        "CON": "Gregory says (Moral. i, 33) that the three daughters of \nJob signify these three virtues, faith, hope and charity. Therefore hope \nis a virtue.",
        "ANS": "According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6) \"the virtue \nof a thing is that which makes its subject good, and its work good \nlikewise.\" Consequently wherever we find a good human act, it must \ncorrespond to some human virtue. Now in all things measured and ruled, \nthe good is that which attains its proper rule: thus we say that a coat \nis good if it neither exceeds nor falls short of its proper measurement. \nBut, as we stated above (Question [8], Article [3], ad 3) human acts have a twofold \nmeasure; one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the reason, while the \nother is remote and excelling, viz. God: wherefore every human act is \ngood, which attains reason or God Himself. Now the act of hope, whereof \nwe speak now, attains God. For, as we have already stated (FS, Question [40], Article [1]), when we were treating of the passion of hope, the object of hope \nis a future good, difficult but possible to obtain. Now a thing is \npossible to us in two ways: first, by ourselves; secondly, by means of \nothers, as stated in Ethic. iii. Wherefore, in so far as we hope for \nanything as being possible to us by means of the Divine assistance, our \nhope attains God Himself, on Whose help it leans. It is therefore evident \nthat hope is a virtue, since it causes a human act to be good and to \nattain its due rule.",

Wherefore in \nhope too, the good of virtue depends on a man's attaining, by hoping, the \ndue rule, viz. God. Consequently man cannot make ill use of hope which \nattains God, as neither can he make ill use of moral virtue which attains \nthe reason, because to attain thus is to make good use of virtue. \nNevertheless, the hope of which we speak now, is not a passion but a \nhabit of the  mind, as we shall show further on (Article [5]; Question [18], Article [1]).",

Such a \ngood is eternal life, which consists in the enjoyment of God Himself. For \nwe should hope from Him for nothing less than Himself, since His \ngoodness, whereby He imparts good things to His creature, is no less than \nHis Essence.

In order to explain this we must \nobserve that love and hope differ in this, that love denotes union \nbetween lover and beloved, while hope denotes a movement or a stretching \nforth of the appetite towards an arduous good. Now union is of things \nthat are distinct, wherefore love can directly regard the other whom a \nman unites to himself by love, looking upon him as his other self: \nwhereas movement is always towards its own term which is proportionate to \nthe subject moved.

In one \nway it is contrary to charity, when a man places his end in the love of \nhis own good. In another way it is included in charity, when a man loves \nhimself for the sake of God and in God. In a third way, it is indeed \ndistinct from charity, but is not contrary thereto, as when a man loves \nhimself from the point of view of his own good, yet not so as to place \nhis end in this his own good: even as one may have another special love \nfor one's neighbor, besides the love of charity which is founded on God, \nwhen we love him by reason of usefulness, consanguinity, or some other \nhuman consideration, which, however, is referable to charity.\nAccordingly fear of punishment is, in one way, included in charity, \nbecause separation from God is a punishment, which charity shuns \nexceedingly; so that this belongs to chaste fear. In another way, it is \ncontrary to charity, when a man shrinks from the punishment that is \nopposed to his natural good, as being the principal evil in opposition to \nthe good which he loves as an end; and in this way fear of punishment is \nnot consistent with charity. In another way fear of punishment is indeed \nsubstantially distinct from chaste fear, when, to wit, a man fears a \npenal evil, not because it separates him from God, but because it is \nhurtful to his own good, and yet he does not place his end in this good, \nso that neither does he dread this evil as being the principal evil. Such \nfear of punishment is consistent with charity; but it is not called \nservile, except when punishment is dreaded as a principal evil, as \nexplained above (Articles [2],4).

For, seeing that our life is ordained to the \nenjoyment of God, and is directed thereto according to a participation of \nthe Divine Nature, conferred on us through grace, wisdom, as we look at \nit, is considered not only as being cognizant of God, as it is with the \nphilosophers, but also as directing human conduct; since this is directed \nnot only by the human law, but also by the Divine law, as Augustine shows \n(De Trin. xii, 14). Accordingly the beginning of wisdom as to its essence \nconsists in the first principles of wisdom, i.e. the articles of faith, \nand in this sense faith is said to be the beginning of wisdom. But as \nregards the effect, the beginning of wisdom is the point where wisdom \nbegins to work, and in this way fear is the beginning of wisdom, yet \nservile fear in one way, and filial fear, in another. For servile fear is \nlike a principle disposing a man to wisdom from without, in so far as he \nrefrains from sin through fear of punishment, and is thus fashioned for \nthe effect of wisdom, according to Ecclus. 1:27, \"The fear of the Lord \ndriveth out sin.\" On the other hand, chaste or filial fear is the \nbeginning of wisdom, as being the first effect of wisdom.

Now as a thing's good consists in its staying in its own order, so \na thing's evil consists in forsaking its order. Again, the order of a \nrational creature is  that it should be under God and above other \ncreatures. Hence, just as it is an evil for a rational creature to \nsubmit, by love, to a lower creature, so too is it an evil for it, if it \nsubmit not to God, by presumptuously revolt against Him or contemn Him. \nNow this evil is possible to a rational creature considered as to its \nnature on account of the natural flexibility of the free-will; whereas in \nthe blessed, it becomes impossible, by reason of the perfection of glory. \nTherefore the avoidance of this evil that consists in non-subjection to \nGod, and is possible to nature, but impossible in the state of bliss, \nwill be in heaven; while in this life there is avoidance of this evil as \nof something altogether possible.

Augustine also (De Civ. \nDei xiv, 9) in this sense, admits fear in heaven, although he leaves the \nquestion doubtful. \"If,\" he says, \"this chaste fear that endureth for \never and ever is to be in the future life, it will not be a fear that is \nafraid of an evil which might possibly occur, but a fear that holds fast \nto a good which we cannot lose. For when we love the good which we have \nacquired, with an unchangeable love, without doubt, if it is allowable to \nsay so, our fear is sure of avoiding evil. Because chaste fear denotes a \nwill that cannot consent to sin, and whereby we avoid sin without \ntrembling lest, in our weakness, we fall, and possess ourselves in the \ntranquillity born of charity. Else, if no kind of fear is possible there, \nperhaps fear is said to endure for ever and ever, because that which fear \nwill lead us to, will be everlasting.\"",

The precepts that belong to the \nsubstance of the Law are those which relate to right conduct and are \nimposed on man already subject and ready to obey: wherefore when the Law \nwas given these precepts were set forth from the very outset under form \nof a command.\nYet the precepts of hope and faith were not to be given under the form \nof a command, since, unless man already believed and hoped, it would be \nuseless to give him the Law: but, just as the precept of faith had to be \ngiven under the form of an announcement or reminder, as stated above \n(Question [16], Article [1]), so too, the precept of hope, in the first promulgation of \nthe Law, had to be given under the form of a promise.

Nor does \nhe mean to say that this movement of love whereby we love God is the Holy \nGhost Himself, but that this movement is from the Holy Ghost without any \nintermediary habit, whereas other virtuous acts are from the Holy Ghost \nby means of the habits of other virtues, for instance the habit of faith \nor hope or of some other virtue: and this he said on account of the \nexcellence of charity.\nBut if we consider the matter aright, this would be, on the contrary, \ndetrimental to charity. For when the Holy Ghost moves the human mind the \nmovement of charity does not proceed from this motion in such a way that \nthe human mind be merely moved, without being the principle of this \nmovement, as when a body is moved by some extrinsic motive power. For \nthis is contrary to the nature of a voluntary act, whose principle needs \nto be in itself, as stated above (FS, Question [6], Article [1]): so that it would \nfollow that to love is not a voluntary act, which involves a \ncontradiction, since love, of its very nature, implies an act of the will.\nLikewise, neither can it be said that the Holy Ghost moves the will in \nsuch a way to the act of loving, as though the will were an instrument, \nfor an instrument, though it be a principle of action, nevertheless has \nnot the power to act or not to act, for then again the act would cease to \nbe voluntary and meritorious, whereas it has been stated above (FS, \nQuestion [114], Article [4]) that the love of charity is the root of merit: and, given \nthat the will is moved by the Holy Ghost to the act of love, it is \nnecessary that the will also should be  the efficient cause of that act.\nNow no act is perfectly produced by an active power, unless it be \nconnatural to that power of reason of some form which is the principle of \nthat action. Wherefore God, Who moves all things to their due ends, \nbestowed on each thing the form whereby it is inclined to the end \nappointed to it by Him; and in this way He \"ordereth all things sweetly\" \n(Wis. 8:1). But it is evident that the act of charity surpasses the \nnature of the power of the will, so that, therefore, unless some form be \nsuperadded to the natural power, inclining it to the act of love, this \nsame act would be less perfect than the natural acts and the acts of the \nother powers; nor would it be easy and pleasurable to perform. And this \nis evidently untrue, since no virtue has such a strong inclination to its \nact as charity has, nor does any virtue perform its act with so great \npleasure. Therefore it is most necessary that, for us to perform the act \nof charity, there should be in us some habitual form superadded to the \nnatural power, inclining that power to the act of charity, and causing it \nto act with ease and pleasure.",

Hence charity is more excellent than faith or \nhope, and, consequently, than all the other virtues, just as prudence, \nwhich by itself attains reason, is more excellent than the other moral \nvirtues, which attain reason in so far as it appoints the mean in human \noperations or passions.",

On the other hand, things \nthat are above the soul, are more excellent in themselves than they are \nin the soul. Consequently it is better to know than to love the things \nthat are beneath us; for which reason the Philosopher gave the preference \nto the intellectual virtues over the moral virtues (Ethic. x, 7,8): \nwhereas the love of the things that are above us, especially of God, \nranks before the knowledge of such things.

Accordingly, just \nas the end is twofold, the last end, and the proximate end, so also, is \ngood twofold, one, the ultimate and universal good, the other proximate \nand particular. The ultimate and principal good of man is the enjoyment \nof God, according to Ps. 72:28: \"It is good for me to adhere to God,\" and \nto this good man is ordered by charity. Man's secondary and, as it were, \nparticular good may be twofold: one is truly good, because, considered in \nitself, it can be directed to the principal good, which is the last end; \nwhile the other is good apparently and not truly, because it leads us \naway from the final good. Accordingly it is evident that simply true \nvirtue is that which is directed to man's principal good; thus also the \nPhilosopher says (Phys. vii, text. 17) that \"virtue is the disposition of \na perfect thing to that which is best\": and in this way no true virtue is \npossible without charity.\nIf, however, we take virtue as being ordered to some particular end, \nthen we speak of virtue being where there is no charity, in so far as it \nis directed to some particular good. But if this particular good is not a \ntrue, but an apparent good, it is not a true virtue that is ordered to \nsuch a good, but a counterfeit virtue. Even so, as Augustine says (Contra \nJulian. iv, 3), \"the prudence of the miser, whereby he devises various \nroads to gain, is no true virtue; nor the miser's justice, whereby he \nscorns the property of another through fear of severe punishment; nor the \nmiser's temperance, whereby he curbs his desire for expensive pleasures; \nnor the miser's fortitude, whereby as Horace, says, 'he braves the sea, \nhe crosses mountains, he goes through fire, in order to avoid poverty'\" \n(Epis. lib, 1; Ep. i, 45). If, on the other hand, this particular good be \na true good, for instance the welfare of the state, or the like, it will \nindeed be a true virtue, imperfect, however, unless it be referred to the \nfinal and perfect good.

For God is able to \nincrease a bodily quantity by adding a magnitude which did not exist \nbefore, but was created at that very moment; which magnitude, though not \npre-existent in reality, is nevertheless capable of being distinguished \nfrom the quantity to which it is added. Wherefore if charity be added to \ncharity we must presuppose the distinction, at least logical, of the one \ncharity from the other.\nNow distinction among forms is twofold: specific and numeric. Specific \ndistinction of habits follows diversity of objects, while numeric \ndistinction follows distinction of subjects. Consequently a habit may \nreceive increase through extending to objects to which it did not extend \nbefore: thus the science of geometry increases in one who acquires \nknowledge of geometrical matters which he ignored hitherto. But this \ncannot be said of charity, for even the slightest charity extends to all \nthat we have to love by charity. Hence the addition which causes an \nincrease of charity cannot be understood, as though the added charity \nwere presupposed to be distinct specifically from that to which it is \nadded.\nIt follows therefore that if charity be added to charity, we must \npresuppose a numerical distinction between them, which follows a \ndistinction of subjects: thus whiteness receives an increase when one \nwhite thing is added to another, although such an increase does not make \na thing whiter.

        "ANS": "The quantity which charity has in comparison with its \nproper object, cannot decrease, even as neither can it increase, as \nstated above (Article [4], ad 2).\nSince, however, it increases in that quantity which it has in comparison \nwith its subject, here is the place to consider whether it can decrease \nin this way. Now, if it decrease, this must needs be either through an \nact, or by the mere cessation from act. It is true that virtues acquired \nthrough acts decrease and sometimes cease altogether through cessation \nfrom act, as stated above (FS, Question [53], Article [3]). Wherefore the Philosopher \nsays, in reference to friendship (Ethic. viii, 5) \"that want of \nintercourse,\" i.e. the neglect to call upon or speak with one's friends, \n\"has destroyed many a friendship.\" Now this is because the safe-keeping \nof a thing depends on its cause, and the cause of human virtue is a human \nact, so that when human acts cease, the virtue acquired thereby decreases \nand at last ceases altogether. Yet this does not occur to charity, \nbecause it is not the result of human acts, but is caused by God alone, \nas stated above (Article [2]). Hence it follows that even when  its act ceases, \nit does not for this reason decrease, or cease altogether, unless the \ncessation involves a sin.\nThe consequence is that a decrease of charity cannot be caused except \neither by God or by some sinful act. Now no defect is caused in us by \nGod, except by way of punishment, in so far as He withdraws His grace in \npunishment of sin. Hence He does not diminish charity except by way of \npunishment: and this punishment is due on account of sin.\nIt follows, therefore, that if charity decrease, the cause of this \ndecrease must be sin either effectively or by way of merit. But mortal \nsin does not diminish charity, in either of these ways, but destroys it \nentirely, both effectively, because every mortal sin is contrary to \ncharity, as we shall state further on (Article [12]), and by way of merit, since \nwhen, by sinning mortally, a man acts against charity, he deserves that \nGod should withdraw charity from him.\nIn like manner, neither can venial sin diminish charity either \neffectively or by way of merit. Not effectively, because it does not \ntouch charity, since charity is about the last end, whereas venial sin is \na disorder about things directed to the end: and a man's love for the end \nis none the less through his committing an inordinate act as regards the \nthings directed to the end. Thus sick people sometimes, though they love \nhealth much, are irregular in keeping to their diet: and thus again, in \nspeculative sciences, the false opinions that are derived from the \nprinciples, do not diminish the certitude of the principles. So too, \nvenial sin does not merit diminution of charity; for when a man offends \nin a small matter he does not deserve to be mulcted in a great matter. \nFor God does not turn away from man, more than man turns away from Him: \nwherefore he that is out of order in respect of things directed to the \nend, does not deserve to be mulcted in charity whereby he is ordered to \nthe last end.\nThe consequence is that charity can by no means be diminished, if we \nspeak of direct causality, yet whatever disposes to its corruption may be \nsaid to conduce indirectly to its diminution, and such are venial sins, \nor even the cessation from the practice of works of charity.",
        "RP1": "Contraries affect the same subject when that subject stands \nin equal relation to both. But charity does not stand in equal relation \nto increase and decrease. For it can have a cause of increase, but not of \ndecrease, as stated above. Hence the argument does not prove.",
        "RP2": "Cupidity is twofold, one whereby man places his end in \ncreatures, and this kills charity altogether, since it is its poison, as \nAugustine states (Confess. x). This makes us love God less (i.e. less \nthan we ought to love Him by charity), not indeed by diminishing charity \nbut by destroying it altogether. It is thus that we must understand the \nsaying: \"He loves Thee less,  who loves aught beside Thee,\" for he adds \nthese words, \"which he loveth not for Thee.\" This does not apply to \nvenial sin, but only to mortal sin: since that which we love in venial \nsin, is loved for God's sake habitually though not actually. There is \nanother cupidity, that of venial sin, which is always diminished by \ncharity: and yet this cupidity cannot diminish charity, for the reason \ngiven above.",

We can, accordingly, consider charity in three ways: \nfirst on the part of the Holy Ghost, Who moves the soul to love God, and \nin this respect charity is incompatible with sin through the power of the \nHoly Ghost, Who does unfailingly whatever He wills to do. Hence it is \nimpossible for these two things to be true at the same time---that the \nHoly Ghost should will to move a certain man to an act of charity, and \nthat this man, by sinning, should lose charity. For the gift of \nperseverance is reckoned among the blessings of God whereby \"whoever is \ndelivered, is most certainly delivered,\" as Augustine says in his book on \nthe Predestination of the saints (De Dono Persev. xiv).\nSecondly, charity may be considered as such, and thus it is incapable of \nanything that is against its nature. Wherefore charity cannot sin at all, \neven as neither can heat cool, nor unrighteousness do good, as Augustine \nsays (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 24).\nThirdly, charity can be considered on the part of its subject, which is \nchangeable on account of the free-will. Moreover charity may be compared \nwith this subject, both from the general point of view of form in \ncomparison with matter, and from the specific point of view of habit as \ncompared with power. Now it is natural for a form to be in its subject in \nsuch a way that it can be lost, when it does not entirely fill the \npotentiality of matter: this is evident in the forms of things generated \nand corrupted, because the matter of such things receives one form in \nsuch a way, that it retains the potentiality to another form, as though \nits potentiality were not completely satisfied with the one form. Hence \nthe one form may be lost by the other being received. On the other hand \nthe form of a celestial body which entirely fills the potentiality of its \nmatter, so that the latter does not retain the potentiality to another \nform, is in its subject inseparably. Accordingly the charity of the \nblessed, because it entirely fills the potentiality of the rational mind, \nsince every actual movement of that mind is directed to God, is possessed \nby its subject inseparably: whereas the charity of the wayfarer does not \nso fill the potentiality of its subject, because the latter is not always \nactually directed to God: so that when it is not actually directed to \nGod, something may occur whereby charity is lost.\nIt is proper to a habit to incline a power to act, and this belongs to a \nhabit, in so far as it makes whatever is suitable to it, to seem good, \nand whatever is unsuitable, to seem evil. For as the taste judges of \nsavors according to its disposition, even so does the human mind judge of \nthings to be done, according to its habitual disposition. Hence the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5) that \"such as a man is, so does the end \nappear to him.\" Accordingly charity is inseparable from its possessor, \nwhere that which pertains to charity cannot appear otherwise than good, \nand that is in heaven, where God is seen in His Essence, which is the \nvery essence of goodness.

Now every mortal sin is contrary to charity by its very \nnature, which consists in man's loving God above all things, and \nsubjecting himself to Him entirely, by referring all that is his to God. \nIt is therefore essential to charity that man should so love God as to \nwish to submit to Him in all things, and always to follow the rule of His \ncommandments; since whatever is contrary to His commandments is \nmanifestly contrary to charity, and therefore by its very nature is \ncapable of destroying charity.\nIf indeed charity were an acquired habit dependent on the power of its \nsubject, it would not necessarily be removed by one mortal sin, for act \nis directly contrary, not to habit but to act. Now the endurance of a \nhabit in its subject does not require the endurance of its act, so that \nwhen a contrary act supervenes the acquired habit is not at once done \naway. But charity, being an infused habit, depends on the action of God \nWho infuses it, Who stands in relation to the infusion and safekeeping of \ncharity, as the sun does to the diffusion of light in the air, as stated \nabove (Article [10], OBJ 3). Consequently, just as the light would cease at once \nin the air, were an obstacle placed to its being lit up by the sun, even \nso charity ceases at once to be in the soul through the placing of an \nobstacle to the outpouring of charity by God into the soul.\nNow it is evident that through every mortal sin which is contrary to \nGod's commandments, an obstacle is placed to the outpouring of charity, \nsince from the very fact that a man chooses to prefer sin to God's \nfriendship, which requires that we should obey His will, it follows that \nthe habit of charity is lost at once through one mortal sin. Hence \nAugustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) that \"man is enlightened by God's \npresence, but he is darkened at once by God's absence, because distance \nfrom Him is effected not by change of place but by aversion of the will.\"",

Nevertheless he falls, and loses \ncharity through the one mortal sin if he commits it.\nSince, however, he adds: \"If some slight slip should occur, and he \nrecover himself quickly he does not appear to fall altogether,\" we may \nreply in another way, that when he speaks of a man being emptied and \nfalling away altogether, he means one who falls so as to sin through \nmalice; and this does not occur in a perfect man all at once.",

In this way the good love themselves, as to the inward man, \nbecause they wish the preservation thereof in its integrity, they desire \ngood things for him, namely spiritual goods, indeed they do their best to \nobtain them, and they take pleasure in entering into their own hearts, \nbecause they find there good thoughts in the present, the memory of past \ngood, and the hope of future good, all of which are sources of pleasure. \nLikewise they experience no clashing of wills, since their whole soul \ntends to one thing.\nOn the other hand, the wicked have no wish to be preserved in the \nintegrity of the inward man, nor do they desire spiritual goods for him, \nnor do they work for that end, nor do they take pleasure in their own \ncompany by entering into their own hearts, because whatever they find \nthere, present, past and future, is evil and horrible; nor do they agree \nwith themselves, on account of the gnawings of conscience, according to \nPs. 49:21: \"I will reprove thee and set before thy face.\"\nIn the same manner it may be shown that the wicked love themselves, as \nregards the corruption of the outward man, whereas the good do not love \nthemselves thus.",
        "RP1": "The love of self which is the principle of sin is that \nwhich is proper to the wicked, and reaches \"to the contempt of God,\" as \nstated in the passage quoted, because the wicked so desire external goods \nas to despise spiritual goods.",

That man should actually do so, and love his enemy for God's \nsake, without it being necessary for him to do so, belongs to the \nperfection of charity. For since man loves his neighbor, out of charity, \nfor God's sake, the more he loves God, the more does he put enmities \naside and show love towards his neighbor: thus if we loved a certain man \nvery much, we would love his children though they were unfriendly towards \nus.

For the affection of charity, which is the \ninclination of grace, is not less orderly than the natural appetite, \nwhich is the inclination of nature, for both inclinations flow from \nDivine wisdom. Now we observe in the physical order that the natural \ninclination in each thing is proportionate to the act or movement that is \nbecoming to the nature of that thing: thus in earth the inclination of \ngravity is greater than in water, because it is becoming to earth to be \nbeneath water.

The reason is that,  since the \nprinciple of love is God, and the person who loves, it must needs be that \nthe affection of love increases in proportion to the nearness to one or \nthe other of those principles.

Accordingly love takes its species from its object, but its \nintensity is due to the lover.\nNow the object of charity's love is God, and man is the lover. Therefore \nthe specific diversity of the love which is in accordance with charity, \nas regards the love of our neighbor, depends on his relation to God, so \nthat, out of charity, we should wish a greater good to one who is nearer \nto God; for though the good which charity wishes to all, viz. everlasting \nhappiness, is one in itself, yet it has various degrees according to \nvarious shares of happiness, and it belongs to charity to wish God's \njustice to be maintained, in accordance with which better men have a \nfuller share of happiness. And this regards the species of love; for \nthere are different species of love according to the different goods that \nwe wish for those whom we love.\nOn the other hand, the intensity of love is measured with regard to the \nman who loves, and accordingly man loves those who are more closely \nunited to him, with more intense affection as to the good he wishes for \nthem, than he loves those who are better as to the greater good he wishes \nfor them.\nAgain a further difference must be observed here: for some neighbors are \nconnected with us by their natural origin, a connection which cannot be \nsevered, since that origin makes them to be what they are. But the \ngoodness of virtue, wherein some are close to God, can come and go, \nincrease and decrease, as was shown above (Question [24], Articles [4],10,11). Hence it \nis possible for one, out of charity, to wish this man who is more closely \nunited to one, to be better than another, and so reach a higher degree of \nhappiness.\nMoreover there is yet another reason for which, out of charity, we love \nmore those who are more nearly connected with us, since we love them in \nmore ways. For, towards those who are not connected with us we have no \nother friendship than charity, whereas for those who are connected with \nus, we have certain other  friendships, according to the way in which \nthey are connected. Now since the good on which every other friendship of \nthe virtuous is based, is directed, as to its end, to the good on which \ncharity is based, it follows that charity commands each act of another \nfriendship, even as the art which is about the end commands the art which \nis about the means. Consequently this very act of loving someone because \nhe is akin or connected with us, or because he is a fellow-countryman or \nfor any like reason that is referable to the end of charity, can be \ncommanded by charity, so that, out of charity both eliciting and \ncommanding, we love in more ways those who are more nearly connected with \nus.",

In the first way we ought to \nlove our benefactor most, because, since he is a principle of good to the \nman he has benefited, he has the character of a more excellent good, as \nstated above with regard to one's father (Article [9]).\nIn the second way, however, we love those more who have received \nbenefactions from us, as the Philosopher proves (Ethic. ix, 7) by four \narguments. First because the recipient of benefactions is the handiwork \nof the benefactor, so that we are wont to say of a man: \"He was made by \nso and so.\" Now it is natural to a man to love his own work (thus it is \nto be observed that poets love their own poems): and the reason is that \nwe love \"to be\" and \"to live,\" and these are made manifest in our \n\"action.\" Secondly, because we all naturally love that in which we see \nour own good. Now it is true that the benefactor has some good of his in \nthe recipient of his benefaction, and the recipient some good in the \nbenefactor; but the benefactor sees his virtuous good in the recipient, \nwhile the recipient sees his useful good in the benefactor. Now it gives \nmore pleasure to see one's virtuous good than one's useful good, both \nbecause it is more enduring for usefulness quickly flits by, and the \npleasure of calling a thing to mind is not like the pleasure of having it \npresent and because it is more pleasant to recall virtuous goods than the \nprofit we have derived from others. Thirdly, because is it the lover's \npart to act, since he wills and works the good of the beloved, while the \nbeloved takes a passive part in receiving good, so that to love surpasses \nbeing loved, for which reason the greater love is on the part of the \nbenefactor. Fourthly because it is more difficult to give than to receive \nfavors: and we are most fond of things which have cost us most trouble, \nwhile we almost despise what comes easy to us.",

But, as regards the order \nbetween man himself and other men, a distinction would seem to be \nnecessary, because, as we stated above (Articles [7],9), the degrees of love may \nbe distinguished either in respect of the good which a man desires for \nanother, or according to the intensity of love itself. In the first way a \nman will love better men more than himself, and those who are less good, \nless than himself: because, by reason of the perfect conformity of the \nhuman to the Divine will, each of the blessed will desire everyone to \nhave what is due to him according to Divine justice. Nor will that be a \ntime for advancing by means of merit to a yet greater reward, as happens \nnow while it is possible for a man to desire both the virtue and the \nreward of a better man, whereas then the will of each one will  rest \nwithin the limits determined by God. But in the second way a man will \nlove himself more than even his better neighbors, because the intensity \nof the act of love arises on the part of the person who loves, as stated \nabove (Articles [7],9). Moreover it is for this that the gift of charity is \nbestowed by God on each one, namely, that he may first of all direct his \nmind to God, and this pertains to a man's love for himself, and that, in \nthe second place, he may wish other things to be directed to God, and \neven work for that end according to his capacity.\nAs to the order to be observed among our neighbors, a man will simply \nlove those who are better, according to the love of charity. Because the \nentire life of the blessed consists in directing their minds to God, \nwherefore the entire ordering of their love will be ruled with respect to \nGod, so that each one will love more and reckon to be nearer to himself \nthose who are nearer to God. For then one man will no longer succor \nanother, as he needs to in the present life, wherein each man has to \nsuccor those who are closely connected with him rather than those who are \nnot, no matter what be the nature of their distress: hence it is that in \nthis life, a man, by the inclination of charity, loves more those who are \nmore closely united to him, for he is under a greater obligation to \nbestow on them the effect of charity. It will however be possible in \nheaven for a man to love in several ways one who is connected with him, \nsince the causes of virtuous love will not be banished from the mind of \nthe blessed. Yet all these reasons are incomparably surpassed by that \nwhich is taken from nighness to God.",

Hence, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, \n3), \"in every art, the desire for the end is endless and unlimited,\" \nwhereas there is a limit to the means: thus the physician does not put \nlimits to health, but makes it as perfect as he possibly can; but he puts \na limit to medicine, for he does not give as much medicine as he can, but \naccording as health demands so that if he give too much or too little, \nthe medicine would be immoderate.\nAgain, the end of all human actions and affections is the love of God, \nwhereby principally we attain to our last end, as stated above (Question [23], Article [6]), wherefore the mode in the love of God, must not be taken as in a \nthing measured where we find too much or too little, but as in the \nmeasure itself, where there cannot be excess, and where the more the rule \nis attained the better it is, so that the more we love God the better our \nlove is.",
        "RP1": "That which is so by its essence takes precedence of that \nwhich is so through another, wherefore the goodness of the measure which \nhas the mode essentially, takes precedence of the goodness of the thing \nmeasured, which has its mode through something else; and so too, charity, \nwhich has a mode as a measure has, stands before the other virtues, which \nhave a mode through being measured .",
        "RP2": "As Augustine adds in the same passage, \"the measure of our \nlove for God is to love Him with our whole heart,\" that is to love Him as \nmuch as He can be loved, and this belongs to the mode which is proper to \nthe measure.",
        "RP3": "An affection, whose object is subject to reason's judgment, \nshould be measured by reason. But the object of the Divine love which is \nGod surpasses the judgment of reason, wherefore it is not measured by \nreason but transcends it. Nor is there parity between the interior act \nand external acts of charity. For the interior act of charity has the \ncharacter of an end, since man's ultimate good consists in his soul \ncleaving to God, according to Ps. 72:28: \"It is good for me to adhere to \nmy God\"; whereas the exterior acts are as means to the end, and so have \nto be measured both according to charity and according to reason."

First, because it is possible to love \none's friend for another reason than God, whereas God is the only reason \nfor loving one's enemy. Secondly, because if we suppose that both are \nloved for God, our love for God is proved to be all the stronger through \ncarrying a man's affections to things which are furthest from him, \nnamely, to the love of his enemies, even as the power of a furnace is \nproved to be the stronger, according as it throws its heat to more \ndistant objects. Hence our love for God is proved to be so much the \nstronger, as the more difficult are the things we accomplish for its \nsake, just as the power of fire is so much the stronger, as it is able to \nset fire to a less inflammable matter.\nYet just as the same fire acts with greater force on what is near than \non what is distant, so too, charity loves with greater fervor those who \nare united to us than those who are far removed; and in this respect the \nlove of friends, considered in itself, is more ardent and better than the \nlove of one's enemy.",

If it occurs during this life, it is \neither a common need in respect of things needed by all, or it is a \nspecial need occurring through some accident supervening. In the first \ncase, the need is either internal or external. Internal need is twofold: \none which is relieved by solid food, viz. hunger, in respect of which we \nhave \"to feed the hungry\"; while the other is relieved by liquid food, \nviz. thirst, and in respect of this we have \"to give drink to the \nthirsty.\" The common need with regard to external help is twofold; one in \nrespect of clothing, and as to this we have \"to clothe the naked\": while \nthe other is in respect of a dwelling place, and as to this we have \"to \nharbor the harborless.\" Again if the need be special, it is either the \nresult of an internal cause, like sickness, and then we have \"to visit \nthe sick,\" or it results from an external cause, and then we have \"to \nransom the captive.\" After this life we give \"burial to the dead.\"\nIn like manner spiritual needs are relieved by spiritual acts in two \nways, first by asking for help from God, and in this respect we have \n\"prayer,\" whereby one man prays for others; secondly, by giving human \nassistance, and this in three ways. First, in order to relieve a \ndeficiency on the part of the intellect, and if this deficiency be in the \nspeculative intellect, the remedy is applied by \"instructing,\" and if in \nthe practical intellect, the remedy is applied by \"counselling.\" \nSecondly, there may be a deficiency on the part of the appetitive power, \nespecially by way of sorrow, which is remedied by \"comforting.\" Thirdly, \nthe deficiency may be due to an inordinate act; and this may be the \nsubject of a threefold consideration. First, in respect of the sinner, \ninasmuch as the sin proceeds from his inordinate will, and thus the \nremedy takes the form of \"reproof.\" Secondly, in respect of the person \nsinned against; and if the sin be committed against ourselves, we apply \nthe remedy by \"pardoning the injury,\" while, if it be committed against \nGod or our neighbor, it is not in our power to pardon, as Jerome observes \n(Super Matth. xviii, 15).

Therefore, if almsgiving were a matter \nof precept, it would be possible to point to some fixed time when a man \nwould commit a mortal sin unless he gave an alms. But it does not appear \nhow this can be so, because it can always be deemed probable that the \nperson in need can be relieved in some other way, and that what we would \nspend in almsgiving might be needful to ourselves either now or in some \nfuture time. Therefore it seems that almsgiving is not a matter of \nprecept.",

        "ANS": "As love of our neighbor is a matter of precept, whatever \nis a necessary condition to the love of our neighbor is a matter of \nprecept also. Now the love of our neighbor requires that not only should \nwe be our neighbor's well-wishers, but also his  well-doers, according to \n1 Jn. 3:18: \"Let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in \ntruth.\" And in order to be a person's well-wisher and well-doer, we ought \nto succor his needs: this is done by almsgiving. Therefore almsgiving is \na matter of precept.\nSince, however, precepts are about acts of virtue, it follows that all \nalmsgiving must be a matter of precept, in so far as it is necessary to \nvirtue, namely, in so far as it is demanded by right reason. Now right \nreason demands that we should take into consideration something on the \npart of the giver, and something on the part of the recipient. On the \npart of the giver, it must be noted that he should give of his surplus, \naccording to Lk. 11:41: \"That which remaineth, give alms.\" This surplus \nis to be taken in reference not only to himself, so as to denote what is \nunnecessary to the individual, but also in reference to those of whom he \nhas charge (in which case we have the expression \"necessary to the \nperson\" [*The official necessities of a person in position] taking the \nword \"person\" as expressive of dignity). Because each one must first of \nall look after himself and then after those over whom he has charge, and \nafterwards with what remains relieve the needs of others. Thus nature \nfirst, by its nutritive power, takes what it requires for the upkeep of \none's own body, and afterwards yields the residue for the formation of \nanother by the power of generation.\nOn the part of the recipient it is requisite that he should be in need, \nelse there would be no reason for giving him alms: yet since it is not \npossible for one individual to relieve the needs of all, we are not bound \nto relieve all who are in need, but only those who could not be succored \nif we not did succor them. For in such cases the words of Ambrose apply, \n\"Feed him that dies of hunger: if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain \nhim\" [*Cf. Canon Pasce, dist. lxxxvi, whence the words, as quoted, are \ntaken].

Yet I say this without prejudice to \nsuch a case as might happen, supposing that by depriving himself of \nnecessaries a man might help a great personage, and a support of the \nChurch or State, since it would be a praiseworthy act to endanger one's \nlife and the lives of those who are under our charge for the delivery of \nsuch a person, since the common good is to be preferred to one's own.\nSecondly, a thing is said to be necessary, if a man cannot without it \nlive in keeping with his social station, as regards either himself or \nthose of whom he has charge. The \"necessary\" considered thus is not an \ninvariable quantity, for one might add much more to a man's property, and \nyet not go beyond what he needs in this way, or one might take much from \nhim, and he would still have sufficient for the decencies of life in \nkeeping with his own position. Accordingly it is good to give alms of \nthis kind of \"necessary\"; and it is a matter not of precept but of \ncounsel. Yet it would be inordinate to deprive oneself of one's own, in \norder to give to others to such an extent that the residue would be \ninsufficient for one to live in keeping with one's station and the \nordinary occurrences of life: for no man ought to live unbecomingly. \nThere are, however, three exceptions to the above rule. The first is when \na man changes his state of life, for instance, by entering religion, for \nthen he gives away all his possessions for Christ's sake, and does the \ndeed of perfection by transferring himself to another state. Secondly, \nwhen that which he deprives himself of, though it be required for the \ndecencies of life, can nevertheless easily be recovered, so that he does \nnot suffer extreme inconvenience. Thirdly, when he is in presence of \nextreme indigence in an individual, or great need on the part of the \ncommon weal. For in such cases it would seem praiseworthy to forego the \nrequirements of one's station, in order to provide for a greater need.\nThe objections may be easily solved from what has been said."

This is \nfraternal correction properly so called, which is directed to the \namendment of the sinner. Now to do away with anyone's evil is the same as \nto procure his good: and to procure a person's good is an act of charity, \nwhereby we wish and do our friend well. Consequently fraternal correction \nalso is an act of charity, because thereby we drive out our brother's \nevil, viz. sin, the removal of which pertains to charity rather than the \nremoval of an external loss, or of a bodily injury, in so much as the \ncontrary good of virtue is more akin to charity than the good of the body \nor of external things.

Hence we should have to go seeking for those who \nneed correction, in order that we might correct them; which appears to be \ninconvenient, both on account of the great number of sinners, for whose \ncorrection one man could not suffice, and because religious would have to \nleave the cloister in order to reprove men, which would be unbecoming. \nTherefore fraternal correction is not a matter of precept.",

On the other hand, acts of virtue \nmust not be done anyhow, but by observing the due circumstances, which \nare requisite in order that an act be virtuous; namely, that it be done \nwhere, when, and how it ought to be done.

On the other hand, we are not bound to seek someone on whom to \nbestow such favors as are due, not to any certain person, but to all our \nneighbors in general, whether those favors be material or spiritual \ngoods, but it suffices that we bestow them when the opportunity occurs; \nbecause, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28), we must look upon \nthis as a matter of chance. For this reason he says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, \n1) that \"Our Lord warns us not to be listless in regard of one another's \nsins: not indeed by being on the lookout for something to denounce, but \nby correcting what we see\": else we should become spies on the lives of \nothers, which is against the saying of Prov. 24:19: \"Lie not in wait, nor \nseek after wickedness in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.\" It \nis evident from this that there is no need for religious to leave their \ncloister in order to rebuke evil-doers."

Nevertheless a previous sin proves somewhat of a \nhindrance to this correction, for three reasons. First because this \nprevious sin renders a man unworthy to rebuke another; and especially is \nhe unworthy to correct another for a lesser sin, if he himself has \ncommitted a greater. Hence Jerome says on the words, \"Why seest thou the \nmote?\" etc. (Mt. 7:3): \"He is speaking of those who, while they are \nthemselves guilty of mortal sin, have no patience with the lesser sins of \ntheir brethren.\"\nSecondly, such like correction becomes unseemly, on account of the \nscandal which ensues therefrom, if the corrector's sin be well known, \nbecause it would seem that he corrects, not out of charity, but more for \nthe sake of ostentation. Hence the words of Mt. 7:4, \"How sayest thou to \nthy brother?\" etc. are expounded by Chrysostom [*Hom. xvii in the Opus \nImperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] thus: \"That \nis---'With what object?' Out of charity, think you, that you may save \nyour neighbor?\" No, \"because you would look after your own salvation \nfirst. What you want is, not to save others, but to hide your evil deeds \nwith good teaching, and to seek  to be praised by men for your knowledge.\"\nThirdly, on account of the rebuker's pride; when, for instance, a man \nthinks lightly of his own sins, and, in his own heart, sets himself above \nhis neighbor, judging the latter's sins with harsh severity, as though he \nhimself were just man. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, \n19): \"To reprove the faults of others is the duty of good and kindly men: \nwhen a wicked man rebukes anyone, his rebuke is the latter's acquittal.\" \nAnd so, as Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): \"When we have \nto find fault with anyone, we should think whether we were never guilty \nof his sin; and then we must remember that we are men, and might have \nbeen guilty of it; or that we once had it on our conscience, but have it \nno longer: and then we should bethink ourselves that we are all weak, in \norder that our reproof may be the outcome, not of hatred, but of pity. \nBut if we find that we are guilty of the same sin, we must not rebuke \nhim, but groan with him, and invite him to repent with us.\" It follows \nfrom this that, if a sinner reprove a wrongdoer with humility, he does \nnot sin, nor does he bring a further condemnation on himself, although \nthereby he proves himself deserving of condemnation, either in his \nbrother's or in his own conscience, on account of his previous sin.\nHence the Replies to the Objections are clear."

For, in \nworks of charity, we should above all follow the example of God, \naccording to Eph. 5:1,2: \"Be ye followers of God, as most dear children, \nand walk in love.\" Now God sometimes punishes a man for a sin, without \npreviously warning him in secret. Therefore it seems that there is no \nneed for a private admonition to precede denunciation.",
        "OB2": "Further, according to Augustine (De Mendacio xv), we learn from \nthe deeds of holy men how we ought to understand the  commandments of \nHoly Writ. Now among the deeds of holy men we find that a hidden sin is \npublicly denounced, without any previous admonition in private. Thus we \nread (Gn. 37:2) that \"Joseph accused his brethren to his father of a most \nwicked crime\": and (Acts 5:4,9) that Peter publicly denounced Ananias and \nSaphira who had secretly \"by fraud kept back the price of the land,\" \nwithout beforehand admonishing them in private: nor do we read that Our \nLord admonished Judas in secret before denouncing him. Therefore the \nprecept does not require that secret admonition should precede public \ndenunciation.",
        "OB3": "Further, it is a graver matter to accuse than to denounce. Now \none may go to the length of accusing a person publicly, without \npreviously admonishing him in secret: for it is decided in the Decretal \n(Cap. Qualiter, xiv, De Accusationibus) that \"nothing else need precede \naccusation except inscription.\" [*The accuser was bound by Roman Law to \nendorse (se inscribere) the writ of accusation. The effect of this \nendorsement or inscription was that the accuser bound himself, if he \nfailed to prove the accusation, to suffer the same punishment as the \naccused would have to suffer if proved guilty.] Therefore it seems that \nthe precept does not require that a secret admonition should precede \npublic denunciation.",
        "OB4": "Further, it does not seem probable that the customs observed by \nreligious in general are contrary to the precepts of Christ. Now it is \ncustomary among religious orders to proclaim this or that one for a \nfault, without any previous secret admonition. Therefore it seems that \nthis admonition is not required by the precept.",
        "OB5": "Further, religious are bound to obey their prelates. Now a \nprelate sometimes commands either all in general, or someone in \nparticular, to tell him if they know of anything that requires \ncorrection. Therefore it would seem that they are bound to tell them \nthis, even before any secret admonition. Therefore the precept does not \nrequire secret admonition before public denunciation.\nReply to  A prelate is not to be obeyed contrary to a Divine precept, \naccording to Acts 5:29: \"We ought to obey God rather then men.\" Therefore \nwhen a prelate commands anyone to tell him anything that he knows to need \ncorrection, the command rightly understood supports the safeguarding of \nthe order of fraternal correction, whether the command be addressed to \nall in general, or to some particular individual. If, on the other hand, \na prelate were to issue a command in express opposition to this order \ninstituted by Our Lord, both would sin, the one commanding, and the one \nobeying him, as disobeying Our Lord's command. Consequently he ought not \nto be obeyed, because a prelate is not the judge of secret things, but \nGod alone is, wherefore he has no power to command anything in respect of \nhidden matters, except in so far as they are made known through certain \nsigns, as by ill-repute or suspicion; in which cases a prelate can \ncommand just as a judge, whether secular or ecclesiastical, can bind a \nman under oath to tell the truth.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 4) on the words, \n\"Rebuke him between thee and him alone\" (Mt. 18:15): \"Aiming at his \namendment, while avoiding his disgrace: since perhaps from shame he might \nbegin to defend his sin; and him whom you thought to make a better man, \nyou make worse.\" Now we are bound by the precept of charity to beware \nlest our brother become worse. Therefore the order of fraternal \ncorrection comes under the precept.",
        "ANS": "With regard to the public denunciation of sins it is \nnecessary to make a distinction: because sins may be either public or \nsecret. In the case of public sins, a remedy is required not only for the \nsinner, that he may become better, but also for others, who know of his \nsin, lest they be scandalized. Wherefore such like sins should be \ndenounced in public, according to the saying of the Apostle (1 Tim. 5:20): \"Them that sin reprove before all, that the rest also may have \nfear,\" which is to be understood  as referring to public sins, as \nAugustine states (De Verb. Dom. xvi, 7).\nOn the other hand, in the case of secret sins, the words of Our Lord \nseem to apply (Mt. 18:15): \"If thy brother shall offend against thee,\" \netc. For if he offend thee publicly in the presence of others, he no \nlonger sins against thee alone, but also against others whom he \n'disturbs. Since, however, a man's neighbor may take offense even at his \nsecret sins, it seems that we must make yet a further distinction. For \ncertain secret sins are hurtful to our neighbor either in his body or in \nhis soul, as, for instance, when a man plots secretly to betray his \ncountry to its enemies, or when a heretic secretly turns other men away \nfrom the faith. And since he that sins thus in secret, sins not only \nagainst you in particular, but also against others, it is necessary to \ntake steps to denounce him at once, in order to prevent him doing such \nharm, unless by chance you were firmly persuaded that this evil result \nwould be prevented by admonishing him secretly. On the other hand there \nare other sins which injure none but the sinner, and the person sinned \nagainst, either because he alone is hurt by the sinner, or at least \nbecause he alone knows about his sin, and then our one purpose should be \nto succor our sinning brother: and just as the physician of the body \nrestores the sick man to health, if possible, without cutting off a limb, \nbut, if this be unavoidable, cuts off a limb which is least \nindispensable, in order to preserve the life of the whole body, so too he \nwho desires his brother's amendment should, if possible, so amend him as \nregards his conscience, that he keep his good name.\nFor a good name is useful, first of all to the sinner himself, not only \nin temporal matters wherein a man suffers many losses, if he lose his \ngood name, but also in spiritual matters, because many are restrained \nfrom sinning, through fear of dishonor, so that when a man finds his \nhonor lost, he puts no curb on his sinning. Hence Jerome says on Mt. \n18:15: \"If he sin against thee, thou shouldst rebuke him in private, lest \nhe persist in his sin if he should once become shameless or unabashed.\" \nSecondly, we ought to safeguard our sinning brother's good name, both \nbecause the dishonor of one leads to the dishonor of others, according to \nthe saying of Augustine (Ep. ad pleb. Hipponens. lxxviii): \"When a few of \nthose who bear a name for holiness are reported falsely or proved in \ntruth to have done anything wrong, people will seek by busily repeating \nit to make it believed of all\": and also because when one man's sin is \nmade public others are incited to sin likewise.\nSince, however, one's conscience should be preferred to a good name, Our \nLord wished that we should publicly denounce our brother and so deliver \nhis conscience from sin, even though he should forfeit his good name. \nTherefore it is evident that the precept requires a secret admonition to \nprecede public denunciation.",
        "RP1": "Whatever is hidden, is known to God, wherefore hidden sins \nare to the judgment of God, just what public sins are to the judgment of \nman. Nevertheless God does rebuke sinners  sometimes by secretly \nadmonishing them, so to speak, with an inward inspiration, either while \nthey wake or while they sleep, according to Job 33:15-17: \"By a dream in \na vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men . . . then He openeth \nthe ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn, \nthat He may withdraw a man from the things he is doing.\"",

With regard to Joseph it is \nprobable that he warned his brethren, though Scripture does not say so. \nOr we may say that the sin was public with regard to his brethren, \nwherefore it is stated in the plural that he accused \"his brethren.\"",

Such sorrow \nas this cannot be occasioned by virtuous goods, which make a man \nrighteous, but, as the Philosopher states, is about riches, and those \nthings which can accrue to the worthy and the unworthy; and he calls this \nsorrow {nemesis} [*The nearest equivalent is \"indignation.\" The use of \nthe word \"nemesis\" to signify \"revenge\" does not represent the original \nGreek.], saying that it belongs to good morals. But he says this because \nhe considered temporal goods in themselves, in so far as they may seem \ngreat to those who look not to eternal goods: whereas, according to the \nteaching of faith, temporal goods that accrue to those who are unworthy, \nare so disposed according to God's just ordinance, either for the \ncorrection of those men, or for their condemnation, and such goods are as \nnothing in comparison with the goods to come, which are prepared for good \nmen. Wherefore sorrow of this kind is forbidden in Holy Writ, according \nto Ps. 36:1: \"Be not emulous of evil doers, nor envy them that work \niniquity,\" and elsewhere (Ps. 72:2,3): \"My steps had well nigh slipped, \nfor I was envious of the wicked, when I saw the prosperity of sinners \n[*Douay: 'because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the \nprosperity of sinners'].\" Fourthly, we grieve over a man's good, in so \nfar as his good surpasses ours; this is envy properly speaking, and is \nalways sinful, as also the Philosopher states (Rhet. ii, 10), because to \ndo so is to grieve over what should make us rejoice, viz. over our \nneighbor's good.",

For Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 45): \"The \nleading vices seem to worm their way into the deceived mind under some \nkind of pretext, but those which follow them provoke the soul to all \nkinds of outrage, and confuse the mind with their wild outcry.\" Now envy \nis seemingly a most grave sin, for Gregory says (Moral. v, 46): \"Though \nin every evil thing that is done, the venom of our old enemy is infused \ninto the heart of man, yet in this wickedness the serpent stirs his whole \nbowels and discharges the bane of spite fitted to enter deep into the \nmind.\" Therefore envy is not a capital sin.",

Grief at another's prosperity is in one way the very same \nas envy, when, to Wit, a man grieves over another's prosperity, in so far \nas it gives the latter a good name, but in another way it is a daughter \nof envy, in so far as the envious man sees his neighbor prosper \nnotwithstanding his efforts to prevent it. On the other hand, \"joy at \nanother's misfortune\" is not directly the same as envy, but is a result \nthereof, because grief over our neighbor's good which is envy, gives rise \nto joy in his evil."

Hence the sin of schism is, \nproperly speaking, a special sin, for the reason that the schismatic \nintends to sever himself from that unity which is the effect of charity: \nbecause charity unites not only one person to another with the bond of \nspiritual love, but also the whole Church in unity of spirit.\nAccordingly schismatics properly so called are those who, wilfully and \nintentionally separate themselves from the unity of the Church; for this \nis the chief unity, and the particular unity of several individuals among \nthemselves is subordinate to the unity of the Church, even as the mutual \nadaptation of each member of a  natural body is subordinate to the unity \nof the whole body. Now the unity of the Church consists in two things; \nnamely, in the mutual connection or communion of the members of the \nChurch, and again in the subordination of all the members of the Church \nto the one head, according to Col. 2:18,19: \"Puffed up by the sense of \nhis flesh, and not holding the Head, from which the whole body, by joints \nand bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto \nthe increase of God.\" Now this Head is Christ Himself, Whose viceregent \nin the Church is the Sovereign Pontiff. Wherefore schismatics are those \nwho refuse to submit to the Sovereign Pontiff, and to hold communion with \nthose members of the Church who acknowledge his supremacy.",
        "RP1": "The division between man and God that results from sin is \nnot intended by the sinner: it happens beside his intention as a result \nof his turning inordinately to a mutable good, and so it is not schism \nproperly so called.",
        "RP2": "The essence of schism consists in rebelliously disobeying \nthe commandments: and I say \"rebelliously,\" since a schismatic both \nobstinately scorns the commandments of the Church, and refuses to submit \nto her judgment. But every sinner does not do this, wherefore not every \nsin is a schism.",
        "RP3": "Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those \nthings to which each is opposed essentially and directly. For heresy is \nessentially opposed to faith, while schism is essentially opposed to the \nunity of ecclesiastical charity. Wherefore just as faith and charity are \ndifferent virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too \nschism and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a heretic is \nalso a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what Jerome says in his \ncommentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [*In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]: \"I \nconsider the difference between schism and heresy to be that heresy holds \nfalse doctrine while schism severs a man from the Church.\" Nevertheless, \njust as the loss of charity is the road to the loss of faith, according \nto 1 Tim. 1:6: \"From which things,\" i.e. charity and the like, \"some \ngoing astray, are turned aside into vain babbling,\" so too, schism is the \nroad to heresy. Wherefore Jerome adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that \"at \nthe outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference \nbetween schism and heresy: yet there is no schism that does not devise \nsome heresy for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for \nseparating from the Church.\""

Now \nthe genus or species of a sin is taken from its object, as shown above \n(FS, Question [72], Article [1]; FS, Question [73], Article [3]). Wherefore the sin which is opposed to \nthe greater good is, in respect of its genus, more grievous, for instance \na sin committed against God is graver than a sin committed against one's \nneighbor.\nNow it is evident that unbelief is a sin committed against God Himself, \naccording as He is Himself the First Truth, on which faith is founded; \nwhereas schism is opposed to ecclesiastical unity, which is a \nparticipated good, and a lesser good than God Himself. Wherefore it is \nmanifest that the sin of unbelief is generically more grievous than the \nsin of schism, although it may happen that a particular schismatic sins \nmore grievously than a particular unbeliever, either because his contempt \nis greater, or because his sin is a source of greater danger, or for some \nsimilar reason.",

On the other hand, it was not so well known among them that Moses \nwas always to be their ruler, and so it behooved those who rebelled \nagainst his authority to be punished in a miraculous and unwonted manner.\nWe may also reply by saying that the sin of schism was sometimes more \nseverely punished in that people, because they were inclined to seditions \nand schisms. For it is written (1 Esdra 4:15): \"This city since days gone \nby has rebelled against its kings: and seditions and wars were raised \ntherein [*Vulg.: 'This city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the \nkings and provinces, and . . . wars were raised therein of old'].\" Now \nsometimes a more severe punishment is inflicted for an habitual sin (as \nstated above, FS, Question [105], Article [2], ad 9), because punishments are medicines \nintended to keep man away from sin: so that where there is greater \nproneness to sin, a more severe punishment ought to be inflicted.

        "ANS": "In order for a war to be just, three things are  \nnecessary. First, the authority of the sovereign by whose command the war \nis to be waged. For it is not the business of a private individual to \ndeclare war, because he can seek for redress of his rights from the \ntribunal of his superior. Moreover it is not the business of a private \nindividual to summon together the people, which has to be done in \nwartime. And as the care of the common weal is committed to those who are \nin authority, it is their business to watch over the common weal of the \ncity, kingdom or province subject to them. And just as it is lawful for \nthem to have recourse to the sword in defending that common weal against \ninternal disturbances, when they punish evil-doers, according to the \nwords of the Apostle (Rm. 13:4): \"He beareth not the sword in vain: for \nhe is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth \nevil\"; so too, it is their business to have recourse to the sword of war \nin defending the common weal against external enemies. Hence it is said \nto those who are in authority (Ps. 81:4): \"Rescue the poor: and deliver \nthe needy out of the hand of the sinner\"; and for this reason Augustine \nsays (Contra Faust. xxii, 75): \"The natural order conducive to peace \namong mortals demands that the power to declare and counsel war should be \nin the hands of those who hold the supreme authority.\"\nSecondly, a just cause is required, namely that those who are attacked, \nshould be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault. \nWherefore Augustine says (Questions. in Hept., qu. x, super Jos.): \"A just war \nis wont to be described as one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or \nstate has to be punished, for refusing to make amends for the wrongs \ninflicted by its subjects, or to restore what it has seized unjustly.\"\nThirdly, it is necessary that the belligerents should have a rightful \nintention, so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance \nof evil. Hence Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. [*The words quoted are to be \nfound not in St. Augustine's works, but Can. Apud. Caus. xxiii, qu. 1]): \n\"True religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that are waged not for \nmotives of aggrandizement, or cruelty, but with the object of securing \npeace, of punishing evil-doers, and of uplifting the good.\" For it may \nhappen that the war is declared by the legitimate authority, and for a \njust cause, and yet be rendered unlawful through a wicked intention. \nHence Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 74): \"The passion for \ninflicting harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance, an unpacific and \nrelentless spirit, the fever of revolt, the lust of power, and such like \nthings, all these are rightly condemned in war.\"",

Hence the \nApostle says (1 Tim. 1:5): \"The end of the commandment is charity from a \npure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.\" For all the \nvirtues, about whose acts the precepts are given, are directed either to \nthe freeing of the heart from the whirl of the passions---such are the \nvirtues that regulate the passions---or at least to the possession of a \ngood conscience---such are the virtues that regulate operations---or to \nthe having of a right faith---such are those which pertain to the worship \nof God: and these three things are required of man that he may love God. \nFor an impure heart is withdrawn from loving God, on account of the \npassion that inclines it to earthly things; an evil conscience gives man \na horror for God's justice, through fear of His punishments; and an \nuntrue faith draws man's affections to an untrue representation of God, \nand separates him from the truth of God. Now in every genus that which is \nfor its own sake takes precedence of that which is for the sake of \nanother, wherefore the greatest precept is that of charity, as stated in \nMt. 22:39.",

Now \nof those things that are directed to the end there is counsel in the \nreason, and choice in the appetite, of which two, counsel belongs more \nproperly to prudence, since the Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 5,7,9) \nthat a prudent man \"takes good counsel.\" But as choice presupposes \ncounsel, since it is \"the desire for what has been already counselled\" \n(Ethic. iii, 2), it follows that choice can also be ascribed to prudence \nindirectly, in so far, to wit, as prudence directs the choice by means of \ncounsel.",

In this way \nthe parts of prudence, if we take them properly, are the prudence whereby \na man rules himself, and the prudence whereby a man governs a multitude, \nwhich differ specifically as stated above (Question [47], Article [11]). Again, the \nprudence whereby a multitude is governed, is divided into various species \naccording to the various kinds of multitude. There is the multitude which \nis united together for some particular purpose; thus an army is gathered \ntogether to fight, and the prudence that governs this is called \n\"military.\" There is also the multitude that is united together for the \nwhole of life; such is the multitude of a home or family, and this is \nruled by \"domestic prudence\": and such again is the multitude of a city \nor kingdom, the ruling principle of which is \"regnative prudence\" in the \nruler, and \"political prudence,\" simply so called, in the  subjects.\nIf, however, prudence be taken in a wide sense, as including also \nspeculative knowledge, as stated above (Question [47], Article [2], ad 2) then its parts \ninclude \"dialectics,\" \"rhetoric\" and \"physics,\" according to three \nmethods of prudence in the sciences. The first of these is the attaining \nof science by demonstration, which belongs to \"physics\" (if physics be \nunderstood to comprise all demonstrative sciences). The second method is \nto arrive at an opinion through probable premises, and this belongs to \n\"dialectics.\" The third method is to employ conjectures in order to \ninduce a certain suspicion, or to persuade somewhat, and this belongs to \n\"rhetoric.\" It may be said, however, that these three belong also to \nprudence properly so called, since it argues sometimes from necessary \npremises, sometimes from probabilities, and sometimes from conjectures.\nThe potential parts of a virtue are the virtues connected with it, which \nare directed to certain secondary acts or matters, not having, as it \nwere, the whole power of the principal virtue. In this way the parts of \nprudence are \"good counsel,\" which concerns counsel, \"synesis,\" which \nconcerns judgment in matters of ordinary occurrence, and \"gnome,\" which \nconcerns judgment in matters of exception to the law: while \"prudence\" is \nabout the chief act, viz. that of commanding.",
        "RP1": "The various enumerations differ, either because different \nkinds of parts are assigned, or because that which is mentioned in one \nenumeration includes several mentioned in another enumeration. Thus Tully \nincludes \"caution\" and \"circumspection\" under \"foresight,\" and \n\"reasoning,\" \"docility\" and \"shrewdness\" under \"understanding.\"",

First, when a \nman wishes to remember a thing, he should take some suitable yet somewhat \nunwonted illustration of it, since the  unwonted strikes us more, and so \nmakes a greater and stronger impression on the mind; the mind; and this \nexplains why we remember better what we saw when we were children. Now \nthe reason for the necessity of finding these illustrations or images, is \nthat simple and spiritual impressions easily slip from the mind, unless \nthey be tied as it were to some corporeal image, because human knowledge \nhas a greater hold on sensible objects. For this reason memory is \nassigned to the sensitive part of the soul. Secondly, whatever a man \nwishes to retain in his memory he must carefully consider and set in \norder, so that he may pass easily from one memory to another. Hence the \nPhilosopher says (De Memor. et Remin. ii): \"Sometimes a place brings \nmemories back to us: the reason being that we pass quickly from the one \nto the other.\" Thirdly, we must be anxious and earnest about the things \nwe wish to remember, because the more a thing is impressed on the mind, \nthe less it is liable to slip out of it. Wherefore Tully says in his \nRhetoric [*Ad Herenn. de Arte Rhet. iii.] that \"anxiety preserves the \nfigures of images entire.\" Fourthly, we should often reflect on the \nthings we wish to remember. Hence the Philosopher says (De Memoria i) \nthat \"reflection preserves memories,\" because as he remarks (De Memoria \nii) \"custom is a second nature\": wherefore when we reflect on a thing \nfrequently, we quickly call it to mind, through passing from one thing to \nanother by a kind of natural order.",

Since, however, human reason is unable to grasp the singular and \ncontingent things which may occur, the result is that \"the thoughts of \nmortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain\" (Wis. 9:14). Hence in \nthe research of counsel, man requires to be directed by God who \ncomprehends all things: and this is done through the gift of counsel, \nwhereby man is directed as though counseled by God, just as, in human \naffairs, those who are unable to take counsel for themselves, seek \ncounsel from those who are wiser.",

First, that the disposition of that which is moved, differs while it \nis being moved from its disposition when it is in the term of movement. \nIndeed if the mover is the principle of the movement alone, when the \nmovement ceases, the action of the mover ceases as regards the thing \nmoved, since it has already reached the term of movement, even as a \nhouse, after it is built, ceases being built by the builder. On the other \nhand, when the mover is cause not only of the movement, but also of the \nform to which the movement tends, then the action of the mover does  not \ncease even after the form has been attained: thus the sun lightens the \nair even after it is lightened. In this way, then, God causes in us \nvirtue and knowledge, not only when we first acquire them, but also as \nlong as we persevere in them: and it is thus that God causes in the \nblessed a knowledge of what is to be done, not as though they were \nignorant, but by continuing that knowledge in them.\nNevertheless there are things which the blessed, whether angels or men, \ndo not know: such things are not essential to blessedness, but concern \nthe government of things according to Divine Providence. As regards \nthese, we must make a further observation, namely, that God moves the \nmind of the blessed in one way, and the mind of the wayfarer, in another. \nFor God moves the mind of the wayfarer in matters of action, by soothing \nthe pre-existing anxiety of doubt; whereas there is simple nescience in \nthe mind of the blessed as regards the things they do not know. From this \nnescience the angel's mind is cleansed, according to Dionysius (Coel. \nHier. vii), nor does there precede in them any research of doubt, for \nthey simply turn to God; and this is to take counsel of God, for as \nAugustine says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19) \"the angels take counsel of God about \nthings beneath them\": wherefore the instruction which they receive from \nGod in such matters is called \"counsel.\"\nAccordingly the gift of counsel is in the blessed, in so far as God \npreserves in them the knowledge that they have, and enlightens them in \ntheir nescience of what has to be done.",

In the first way, a vice may be said to be general on two \ncounts: first, essentially, because it is  predicated of all sins: and in \nthis way imprudence is not a general sin, as neither is prudence a \ngeneral virtue: since it is concerned with special acts, namely the very \nacts of reason: secondly, by participation; and in this way imprudence is \na general sin: for, just as all the virtues have a share of prudence, in \nso far as it directs them, so have all vices and sins a share of \nimprudence, because no sin can occur, without some defect in an act of \nthe directing reason, which defect belongs to imprudence.\nIf, on the other hand, a sin be called general, not simply but in some \nparticular genus, that is, as containing several species of sin, then \nimprudence is a general sin. For it contains various species in three \nways. First, by opposition to the various subjective parts of prudence, \nfor just as we distinguish the prudence that guides the individual, from \nother kinds that govern communities, as stated above (Question [48]; Question [50], Article [7]), so also we distinguish various kinds of imprudence. Secondly, in \nrespect of the quasi-potential parts of prudence, which are virtues \nconnected with it, and correspond to the several acts of reason.

Thirdly, this may be taken \nby opposition to those things which are requisite for prudence, which are \nthe quasi-integral parts of prudence. Since however all these things are \nintended for the direction of the aforesaid three acts of reason, it \nfollows that all the opposite defects are reducible to the four parts \nmentioned above. Thus incautiousness and incircumspection are included in \n\"thoughtlessness\"; lack of docility, memory, or reason is referable to \n\"precipitation\"; improvidence, lack of intelligence and of shrewdness, \nbelong to \"negligence\" and \"inconstancy.\"",

On \nthe other hand imprudence, by its very nature, denotes a moral vice; and \nfor this reason it can be called a special sin.",
        "RP3": "When various circumstances are corrupted for the same \nmotive, the species of sin is not multiplied: thus it is the same species \nof sin to take what is not one's own, where one ought not, and when one \nought not. If, however, there be various motives, there are various \nspecies: for instance, if one man were to take another's property from \nwhere he ought not, so as to wrong a sacred place, this would constitute \nthe species called sacrilege, while if  another were to take another's \nproperty when he ought not, merely through the lust of possession, this \nwould be a case of simple avarice.

Now it is evident that the endeavor is more earnest when there \nis fear of failure, so that there is less solicitude when success is \nassured.

Hence Augustine says (De Operibus Monach. \nxxvi): \"When Our Lord said: 'Be not solicitous,' etc. . . . He intended \nto forbid them either to make such things their end, or for the sake of \nthese things to do whatever they were commanded to do in preaching the \nGospel.\" Secondly, solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful, \nthrough too much earnestness in endeavoring to obtain temporal things, \nthe result being that a man is drawn away from spiritual things which \nought to be the chief object of his search, wherefore it is written (Mt. 13:22) that \"the care of this world . . . chokes up the word.\" Thirdly, \nthrough over much fear, when, to wit, a man fears to lack necessary \nthings if he do what he ought to do. Now our Lord gives three motives for \nlaying aside this fear. First, on account of the yet greater favors \nbestowed by God on man, independently of his solicitude, viz. his body \nand soul (Mt. 6:26); secondly, on account of the care with which God \nwatches over animals and plants without the assistance of man, according \nto the requirements of their nature; thirdly, because of Divine \nprovidence, through ignorance of which the gentiles are solicitous in \nseeking temporal goods before all others. Consequently He concludes that \nwe should be solicitous most of all about spiritual goods, hoping that \ntemporal goods also may be granted us according to our needs, if we do \nwhat we ought to do.",

Thirdly, this is due to long experience: wherefore the \nPhilosopher says (Rhet. ii, 13) that \"old people are very suspicious, for \nthey have often experienced the faults of others.\" The first two causes \nof suspicion evidently connote perversity of the affections, while the \nthird diminishes the nature of suspicion, in as much as experience leads \nto certainty which is contrary to the nature of suspicion.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [1]), in distributive justice something \nis given to a private individual, in so far as what belongs to the whole \nis due to the part, and in a quantity that is proportionate to the \nimportance of the position of that part in respect of the whole. \nConsequently in distributive justice a person receives all the more of \nthe common goods, according as he holds a more prominent position in the \ncommunity. This prominence in an aristocratic community is gauged \naccording to virtue, in an oligarchy according to wealth, in a democracy \naccording to liberty, and in various ways according to various forms of \ncommunity. Hence in distributive justice the mean is observed, not \naccording to equality between thing and thing, but according to \nproportion between things and persons: in such a way that even as one \nperson surpasses another, so that which is given to one person surpasses \nthat which is allotted to another. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, \n3,4) that the mean in the latter case follows \"geometrical proportion,\" \nwherein equality depends not on quantity but on proportion. For example \nwe say that 6 is to 4 as 3 is to 2, because in either case the proportion \nequals 1-1/2; since the greater number is the sum of the lesser plus its \nhalf: whereas the equality of excess is not one of quantity, because 6 \nexceeds 4 by 2, while 3 exceeds 2 by 1.\nOn the other hand in commutations something is paid to an individual on \naccount of something of his that has been received, as may be seen \nchiefly in selling and buying, where the notion of  commutation is found \nprimarily. Hence it is necessary to equalize thing with thing, so that \nthe one person should pay back to the other just so much as he has become \nricher out of that which belonged to the other. The result of this will \nbe equality according to the \"arithmetical mean\" which is gauged \naccording to equal excess in quantity. Thus 5 is the mean between 6 and \n4, since it exceeds the latter and is exceeded by the former, by 1. \nAccordingly if, at the start, both persons have 5, and one of them \nreceives 1 out of the other's belongings, the one that is the receiver, \nwill have 6, and the other will be left with 4: and so there will be \njustice if both be brought back to the mean, 1 being taken from him that \nhas 6, and given to him that has 4, for then both will have 5 which is \nthe mean.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [51], Articles [8],10), justice is about \ncertain external operations, namely distribution and commutation. These \nconsist in the use of certain externals, whether things, persons or even \nworks: of things, as when one man takes from or restores to another that \nwhich is his; of persons, as when a man does an injury to the very person \nof another, for instance by striking or insulting him, or even by showing \nrespect for him; and of works, as when a man justly exacts a work of \nanother, or does a work for him. Accordingly, if we take for the matter \nof each kind of justice the things themselves of which the operations are \nthe use, the matter of distributive and commutative justice is the same, \nsince things can be distributed out of the common property to \nindividuals, and be the subject of commutation between one person and \nanother; and again there is a certain distribution and payment of \nlaborious works.\nIf, however, we take for the matter of both kinds of justice the \nprincipal actions themselves, whereby we make use of persons, things, and \nworks, there is then a difference of matter between them. For \ndistributive justice directs distributions, while commutative justice \ndirects commutations that can take place between two persons. of these \nsome are involuntary, some voluntary. They are involuntary when anyone \nuses another man's chattel, person, or work against his will, and this \nmay be done secretly by fraud, or openly by violence. In either case the \noffence may be committed against the other man's chattel or person, or \nagainst a person connected with him. If the offence is against his \nchattel and this be taken secretly, it is called \"theft,\" if openly, it \nis called \"robbery.\" If it be against another man's person, it may affect \neither the very substance of his person, or his dignity. If it be against \nthe substance of his person, a man is injured secretly if he is \ntreacherously slain, struck or poisoned, and openly, if he is publicly \nslain, imprisoned, struck or maimed. If it be against his personal \ndignity, a man is injured secretly by false witness, detractions and so \nforth, whereby he is deprived of his good name, and openly, by being \naccused in a court of law, or by public insult. If it be against a \npersonal connection, a man is injured in the person of his wife, secretly \n(for the most part) by adultery, in the person of his slave, if the \nlatter be induced to leave his master: which things can also be done \nopenly. The same applies to other personal connections, and whatever \ninjury may be committed against the principal, may be committed against \nthem also. Adultery, however, and inducing a slave to leave his master \nare properly injuries against the person; yet the latter, since a slave \nis his master's chattel, is referred to theft. Voluntary commutations are \nwhen a man voluntarily transfers his chattel to another person. And if he \ntransfer it simply so that the recipient incurs no debt, as in the case \nof gifts, it is an act, not of justice but of liberality. A voluntary \ntransfer belongs to justice  in so far as it includes the notion of debt, \nand this may occur in many ways. First when one man simply transfers his \nthing to another in exchange for another thing, as happens in selling and \nbuying. Secondly when a man transfers his thing to another, that the \nlatter may have the use of it with the obligation of returning it to its \nowner. If he grant the use of a thing gratuitously, it is called \n\"usufruct\" in things that bear fruit; and simply \"borrowing\" on \"loan\" in \nthings that bear no fruit, such as money, pottery, etc.; but if not even \nthe use is granted gratis, it is called \"letting\" or \"hiring.\" Thirdly, a \nman transfers his thing with the intention of recovering it, not for the \npurpose of its use, but that it may be kept safe, as in a \"deposit,\" or \nunder some obligation, as when a man pledges his property, or when one \nman stands security for another. In all these actions, whether voluntary \nor involuntary, the mean is taken in the same way according to the \nequality of repayment. Hence all these actions belong to the one same \nspecies of justice, namely commutative justice. And this suffices for the \nReplies to the Objections."

This \nkind of just is laid down in the Law (Ex. 21:23,24): \"He shall render \nlife for life, eye for eye,\" etc. And since also to take away what \nbelongs to another is to do an unjust thing, it follows that secondly \nretaliation consists in this also, that whosoever causes loss to another, \nshould suffer loss in his belongings. This just loss is also found in the \nLaw (Ex. 22:1): \"If any man steal an ox or a sheep, and kill or sell it, \nhe shall restore five oxen for one ox and four sheep for one sheep.\" \nThirdly retaliation is transferred to voluntary commutations, where \naction and passion are on both sides, although voluntariness detracts \nfrom the nature of passion, as stated above (Question [59], Article [3]).\nIn all these cases, however, repayment must be made on a basis of \nequality according to the requirements of commutative justice, namely \nthat the meed of passion be equal to the action. Now there would not \nalways be equality if passion were in the same species as the action. \nBecause, in the first place, when a person injures the person of one who \nis greater, the action surpasses any passion of the same species that he \nmight undergo, wherefore he that strikes a prince, is not only struck \nback, but is much more severely punished. In like manner when a man \ndespoils another of his property against the latter's will, the action \nsurpasses the passion if he be merely deprived of that thing, because the \nman who caused another's loss, himself would lose nothing, and so he is \npunished by making restitution several times over, because not only did \nhe injure a private individual, but also the common weal, the security of \nwhose protection he has infringed. Nor again would there be equality of \npassion in voluntary commutations, were one always to exchange one's \nchattel for another man's, because it might happen that the other man's \nchattel is much greater than our own: so that it becomes necessary to \nequalize passion and action in commutations according to a certain \nproportionate commensuration, for which purpose money was invented. Hence \nretaliation is in accordance with commutative justice: but there is no \nplace for it in distributive justice, because in distributive justice we \ndo not consider the equality between thing and thing or between passion \nand action (whence the expression 'contrapassum'), but according to \nproportion between things and persons, as stated above (Article [2]).",

First, by being deprived of what \nhe actually has; and a loss of this kind is always to be made good by \nrepayment in equivalent: for instance if a man damnifies another by \ndestroying his house he is bound to pay him the value of the house. \nSecondly, a man may damnify another by preventing him from obtaining what \nhe was on the way to obtain. A loss of this kind need not be made good in \nequivalent; because to have a thing virtually is less than to have it \nactually, and to be on the way to obtain a thing is to have it merely \nvirtually or potentially, and so were he to be indemnified by receiving \nthe thing actually, he would be paid, not the exact value taken from him, \nbut more, and this is not necessary for salvation, as stated above. \nHowever he is bound to make some compensation, according to the condition \nof persons and things.\nFrom this we see how to answer the First and Second Objections: because \nthe sower of the seed in the field, has the harvest, not actually but \nonly virtually. In like manner he that has money has the profit not yet \nactually but only virtually: and both may be hindered in many ways.",

By reason \nof the thing taken, he is bound to restore it as long as he has it in his \npossession, since the thing that he has in addition to what is his, \nshould be taken away from him, and given to him who lacks it according to \nthe form of commutative justice. On the other hand, the taking of the \nthing that is another's property, may be threefold. For sometimes it is \ninjurious, i.e. against the will of the owner, as in theft and robbery: \nin which case the thief is bound to restitution not only by reason of the \nthing, but also by reason of the injurious action, even though the thing \nis no longer in his possession. For just as a man who strikes another, \nthough he gain nothing thereby, is bound to compensate the injured \nperson, so too he that is guilty of theft or robbery, is bound to make \ncompensation for the loss incurred, although he be no better off; and in \naddition he must be punished for the injustice committed. Secondly, a man \ntakes another's property for his own profit but without committing an \ninjury, i.e. with the consent of the owner, as in the case of a loan: and \nthen, the taker is bound to restitution, not only by reason of the thing, \nbut also by reason of the taking, even if he has lost the thing: for he \nis bound to compensate the person who has done him a favor, and he would \nnot be doing so if the latter were to lose thereby. Thirdly, a man takes \nanother's property without injury to the latter or profit to himself, as \nin the case of a deposit; wherefore he that takes a thing thus, incurs no \nobligation on account of the taking, in fact by taking he grants a favor; \nbut he is bound to restitution on account of the thing taken. \nConsequently if this thing be taken from him without any fault on his \npart, he is not bound to restitution, although he would be, if he were to \nlose the thing through a grievous fault on his part.",

Consequently \nalthough he that has taken something from another, may have ceased to \nhave what he took, through having transferred it to another, yet since \nthat other is deprived of what is his, both are bound to restitution, he \nthat took the thing, on account of the injurious taking, and he that has \nit, on account of the thing.",

Hence whoever is cause of an \nunjust taking is bound to restitution. This happens in two ways, directly \nand indirectly. Directly, when a man induces another to take, and this in \nthree ways. First, on the part of the taking, by moving a man to take, \neither by express command, counsel, or consent, or by praising a man for \nhis courage in thieving. Secondly, on the part of the taker, by giving \nhim shelter or any other kind of assistance. Thirdly, on the part of the \nthing taken, by taking part in the theft or robbery, as a fellow \nevil-doer. Indirectly, when a man does not prevent another from \nevil-doing (provided he be able and bound to prevent him), either by \nomitting the command or counsel which would hinder him from thieving or \nrobbing, or by omitting to do what would have hindered him, or by \nsheltering him after the deed. All these are expressed as follows:\n\"By command, by counsel, by consent, by flattery, by receiving, by \nparticipation, by silence, by not preventing, by not  denouncing.\"\nIt must be observed, however, that in five of these cases the cooperator \nis always bound to restitution. First, in the case of command: because he \nthat commands is the chief mover, wherefore he is bound to restitution \nprincipally. Secondly, in the case of consent; namely of one without \nwhose consent the robbery cannot take place. Thirdly, in the case of \nreceiving; when, to wit, a man is a receiver of thieves, and gives them \nassistance. Fourthly, in the case of participation; when a man takes part \nin the theft and in the booty. Fifthly, he who does not prevent the \ntheft, whereas he is bound to do so; for instance, persons in authority \nwho are bound to safeguard justice on earth, are bound to restitution, if \nby their neglect thieves prosper, because their salary is given to them \nin payment of their preserving justice here below.\nIn the other cases mentioned above, a man is not always bound to \nrestitution: because counsel and flattery are not always the efficacious \ncause of robbery. Hence the counsellor or flatterer is bound to \nrestitution, only when it may be judged with probability that the unjust \ntaking resulted from such causes.",

Yet those \nwho are principals in the deed, and who took possession of the thing, are \nbound to compensate those who have already made restitution. When a man \ncommands an unjust taking that does not follow, no restitution has to be \nmade, since its end is chiefly to restore the property of the person who \nhas been unjustly injured.",

First because every man is more careful to \nprocure what is for himself alone than that which is common to many or to \nall: since each one would shirk the labor and leave to another that which \nconcerns the community, as happens where there is a great number of \nservants. Secondly, because human affairs are conducted in more orderly \nfashion if each man is charged with taking care of some particular thing \nhimself, whereas there would be confusion if everyone had to look after \nany  one thing indeterminately. Thirdly, because a more peaceful state is \nensured to man if each one is contented with his own.

Now coercive power is not exercised in human affairs, save \nby those who hold public authority: and those who have this authority are \naccounted the superiors of those over whom they preside whether by \nordinary or by delegated authority.

Hence a judge must needs judge between two parties, which is the \ncase when one is the prosecutor, and the other the defendant. Therefore \nin criminal cases the judge cannot sentence a man unless the latter has \nan accuser, according to Acts 25:16: \"It is not the custom of the Romans \nto condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers \npresent, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the \ncrimes\" of which he is accused.",

The punishment that is inflicted is on account of \nhis rebellion against the Church, and since this rebellion is manifest, \nit stands instead of an accuser.

One is that he has to judge between accuser and \ndefendant, while the other is that he pronounces the judicial sentence, \nin virtue of his power, not as a private individual but as a public \nperson. Accordingly on two counts a judge is hindered from loosing a \nguilty person from his punishment. First on the part of the accuser, \nwhose right it sometimes is that the guilty party should be \npunished---for instance on account of some injury committed against the \naccuser---because it is not in the power of a judge to remit such \npunishment, since every judge is bound to give each man his right. \nSecondly, he finds a hindrance on the part of the commonwealth, whose \npower he exercises, and to whose good it belongs that evil-doers should \nbe punished.\nNevertheless in this respect there is a difference between judges of \nlower degree and the supreme judge, i.e. the sovereign, to whom the \nentire public authority is entrusted. For the inferior judge has no power \nto exempt a guilty man from punishment against the laws imposed on him by \nhis superior. Wherefore Augustine in commenting on John 19:11, \"Thou \nshouldst not have any power against Me,\" says (Tract. cxvi in Joan.): \n\"The power which God gave Pilate was such that he was under the power of \nCaesar, so that he was by no means free to acquit the person accused.\" On \nthe other hand the sovereign who has full authority in the commonwealth, \ncan lawfully remit the punishment to a guilty person, provided the \ninjured party consent to the remission, and that this do not seem \ndetrimental to the public good.",

The former of these is intended in \ndenunciation, as stated, whereas the second regards properly accusation. \nHence in the case of a crime that conduces to the injury of the \ncommonwealth, a man is bound to accusation, provided he can offer \nsufficient proof, since it is the accuser's duty to prove: as, for \nexample, when anyone's sin conduces to the bodily or spiritual corruption \nof the community.

For instance, \none say that a certain thing happened at such and such a time or place, \nwhile another says it happened at another time or place, they seem not to \nbe speaking of the same event. The evidence is not weakened if one \nwitness says that he does not remember, while the other attests to a \ndeterminate time or place And if on such points as these the witness for \nprosecution and defense disagree altogether, and if they be equal in \nnumber on either side, and of equal standing, the accused should have the \nbenefit of the doubt, because the judge ought to be more inclined to \nacquit than to condemn, except perhaps in favorable suits, such as a \npleading for liberty and the like. If, however, the witnesses for the \nsame side disagree, the judge ought to use his own discretion in \ndiscerning which side to favor, by considering either the number of \nwitnesses, or their standing, or the favorableness of the suit, or the \nnature of the business and of the evidence\nMuch more ought the evidence of one witness to be rejected if he \ncontradict himself when questioned about what he has seen and about what \nhe knows; not, however, if he contradict himself when questioned about \nmatters of opinion and report, since he may be moved to answer \ndifferently according to the different things he has seen and heard.\nOn the other hand if there be discrepancy of evidence in circumstances \nnot touching the substance of the fact, for instance, whether the weather \nwere cloudy or fine, whether the house were painted or not, or such like \nmatters, such discrepancy does not weaken the evidence, because men are \nnot wont to take much notice of such things, wherefore they easily forget \nthem. Indeed, a discrepancy of this kind renders the evidence more \ncredible, as Chrysostom states (Hom. i in Matth.), because if the \nwitnesses agreed in every point, even in the minutest of details, they \nwould seem to have conspired together to say the same thing: but this \nmust be left to the prudent discernment of the judge.",

If, however, it is easy to see how he \ncan be otherwise succored, either by himself, or by some other person \nstill more closely united to him, or in a better position to help him, \none is not bound so strictly to help the one in need that it would be a \nsin not to do so: although it would be praiseworthy to do so where one is \nnot bound to.

Thirdly, a man \nreproaches another for his inferiority or indigence, so as to lessen the \nhonor due to him for any kind of excellence. This is done by \"upbraiding\" \nwords, and properly speaking, occurs when one spitefully reminds a man \nthat one has succored him when he was in need. Hence it is written \n(Ecclus. 20:15): \"He will give a few things and upbraid much.\" \nNevertheless these terms are sometimes employed one for the other."

On the \nother hand the two latter goods, viz. of the body and of external things, \ncan be taken away by violence. Since, however, the goods of the body \nexcel the goods of external things, those sins which injure a man's body \nare more grievous than those which injure his external things. \nConsequently, among other sins committed against one's neighbor, murder \nis the most grievous, since it deprives man of the life which he already \npossesses: after this comes adultery, which is contrary to the right \norder of human generation, whereby man enters upon life.

Secondly, \nspeaking is related to the thing spoken, by way of cause, and this \nbelongs to God first and foremost, since He made all things by His word, \naccording to Ps. 32:9, \"He spoke and they were made\"; while secondarily \nit belongs to man, who, by his word, commands others and thus moves them \nto do something: it is for this purpose that we employ verbs in the \nimperative mood. Thirdly, \"speaking\" is related to the thing spoken by \nexpressing the sentiments of one who desires that which is expressed in \nwords; and for this purpose we employ the verb in the optative mood.\nAccordingly we may omit the first kind of evil speaking which is by way \nof simple assertion of evil, and consider the other two kinds.

On the other hand if a \nman commands or desires another's evil under the aspect of good, it is \nlawful; and it may be called cursing, not strictly speaking, but \naccidentally, because the chief intention of the speaker is directed not \nto evil but to good.\nNow evil may be spoken, by commanding or desiring it, under the aspect \nof a twofold good.

In the  same way the prophets in \nthe Scriptures sometimes call down evils on sinners, as though conforming \ntheir will to Divine justice, although such like imprecation may be taken \nby way of foretelling.

Hence Tully says (De Offic. \niii, 15): \"Contracts should be entirely free from double-dealing: the \nseller must not impose upon the bidder, nor the buyer upon one that bids \nagainst him.\"\nBut, apart from fraud, we may speak of buying and selling in two ways. \nFirst, as considered in themselves, and from this point of view, buying \nand selling seem to be established for the common advantage of both \nparties, one of whom requires that which belongs to the other, and vice \nversa, as the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 3). Now whatever is \nestablished for the common advantage, should not be more of a burden to \none party than to another, and consequently all contracts between them \nshould observe equality of  thing and thing. Again, the quality of a \nthing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it, \nfor which purpose money was invented, as stated in Ethic. v, 5.

In such a case the just \nprice will depend not only on the thing sold, but on the loss which the \nsale brings on the seller. And thus it will be lawful to sell a thing for \nmore than it is worth in itself, though the price paid be not more than \nit is worth to the owner. Yet if the one man derive a great advantage by \nbecoming possessed of the other man's property, and the seller be not at \na loss through being without that thing, the latter ought not to raise \nthe price, because the advantage accruing to the buyer, is not due to the \nseller, but to a circumstance affecting the buyer. Now no man should sell \nwhat is not his, though he may charge for the loss he suffers.\nOn the other hand if a man find that he derives great advantage from \nsomething he has bought, he may, of his own accord, pay the seller \nsomething over and above: and this pertains to his honesty.",

Vend. 2,8].\nOn the other hand the Divine law leaves nothing unpunished that is \ncontrary to virtue. Hence, according to the Divine law, it is reckoned \nunlawful if the equality of justice be not observed in buying and \nselling: and he who has received more than he ought must make \ncompensation to him that has suffered loss, if the loss be considerable. \nI add this condition, because the just price of things is not fixed with \nmathematical precision, but depends on a kind of estimate, so that a \nslight addition or subtraction would not seem to destroy the equality of \njustice.",

Hence we find it \nwritten against certain people (Is. 1:22), \"Thy silver is turned into \ndross, thy wine is mingled with water\": because that which is mixed is \ndefective in its substance.\nAnother defect is in respect of quantity which is known by being \nmeasured: wherefore if anyone knowingly make use of a faulty measure in \nselling, he is guilty of fraud, and the sale is illicit. Hence it is \nwritten (Dt. 25:13,14): \"Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a \ngreater and a less: neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel \nand a less,\" and further on (Dt. 25:16): \"For the Lord . . . abhorreth \nhim that doth these things, and He hateth all injustice.\"\nA third defect is on the part of the quality, for instance, if a man \nsell an unhealthy animal as being a healthy one: and if anyone do this \nknowingly he is guilty of a fraudulent sale, and the sale, in \nconsequence, is illicit.\nIn all these cases not only is the man guilty of a fraudulent sale, but \nhe is also bound to restitution.

Thus \nthe true metal has the property of making people joyful, and is helpful \nmedicinally against certain maladies. Moreover real gold can be employed \nmore frequently, and lasts longer in its condition of purity than \ncounterfeit gold.

Such like trading, \nproperly speaking, does not belong to tradesmen, but rather to \nhousekeepers or civil servants who have to provide the household or the \nstate with the necessaries of life. The other kind of exchange is either \nthat of money for money, or of any commodity for money, not on account of \nthe necessities of life, but for profit, and this kind of exchange, \nproperly speaking, regards tradesmen, according to the Philosopher \n(Polit. i, 3). The former kind of exchange is commendable because it \nsupplies a natural need: but the latter is justly deserving of blame, \nbecause, considered in itself, it satisfies the greed for gain, which \nknows no limit and tends to infinity.

Thus, for instance, a man may intend the moderate gain which he \nseeks to acquire by trading for the upkeep of his household, or for the \nassistance of the needy: or again, a man may take to trade for some \npublic advantage, for instance, lest his country lack the necessaries of \nlife, and seek gain, not as an end, but as payment for his labor.",

Now he is repaid according \nto equality of justice if he is repaid as much as he lent. Wherefore if \nhe exacts more for the usufruct of a thing which has no other use but the \nconsumption of its substance, he exacts a price of something \nnon-existent: and so his exaction is unjust.\nReply to Objection 6: The principal use of a silver vessel is not its \nconsumption, and so one may lawfully sell its use while retaining one's \nownership of it. On the other hand the principal use of silver money is \nsinking it in exchange, so that it is not lawful to sell its use and at \nthe same time expect the restitution of the amount lent. It must be \nobserved, however, that the secondary use of silver vessels may be an \nexchange, and such use may not be lawfully sold. In like manner there may \nbe some secondary use of silver money; for instance, a man might lend \ncoins for show, or to be used as security.\nReply to Objection 7: He who gives usury does not give it voluntarily simply, but \nunder a certain necessity, in so far as he needs to borrow money which \nthe owner is unwilling to lend without usury.",

        "ANS": "To take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because \nthis is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to \ninequality which is contrary to justice. In order to make this evident, \nwe must observe that there are certain things the use of which consists \nin their consumption: thus we consume wine when we use it for drink and \nwe consume wheat when we use it for food. Wherefore in such like things \nthe use of the thing must not be reckoned apart from the thing itself, \nand whoever is granted the use of the thing, is granted the thing itself \nand for this reason, to lend things of this kin is to transfer the \nownership. Accordingly if a man wanted to sell wine separately from the \nuse of the wine, he would be selling the same thing twice, or he would be \nselling what does not exist, wherefore he would evidently commit a sin of \ninjustice. In like manner he commits an injustice who lends wine or \nwheat, and asks for double payment, viz. one, the return of the thing in \nequal measure, the other, the price of the use, which is called usury.\nOn the other hand, there are things the use of which does not consist in \ntheir consumption: thus to use a house is to dwell in it, not to destroy \nit. Wherefore in such things both may be granted: for instance, one man \nmay hand over to another the ownership of his house while reserving to \nhimself the use of it for a time, or vice versa, he may grant the use of \nthe house, while retaining the ownership. For this reason a man may \nlawfully make a charge for the use of his house, and, besides this, \nrevendicate the house from the person to whom he has granted its use, as \nhappens in renting and letting a house.\nNow money, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 5; Polit. i, 3) was \ninvented chiefly for the purpose of exchange: and consequently the proper \nand principal use of money is its consumption or alienation whereby it is \nsunk in exchange. Hence it is by its very nature unlawful to take payment \nfor the use of money lent, which payment is known as usury: and just as a \nman is bound to restore other ill-gotten goods, so is he bound to restore \nthe  money which he has taken in usury.",

Hence it is said without any distinction in Ps. 14:5: \"He \nthat hath not put out his money to usury,\" and (Ezech. 18:8): \"Who hath \nnot taken usury [*Vulg.: 'If a man . . . hath not lent upon money, nor \ntaken any increase . . . he is just.'].\" They were permitted, however, to \ntake usury from foreigners, not as though it were lawful, but in order to \navoid a greater evil, lest, to wit, through avarice to which they were \nprone according to Is. 56:11, they should take usury from the Jews who \nwere worshippers of God.\nWhere we find it promised to them as a reward, \"Thou shalt fenerate to \nmany nations,\" etc., fenerating is to be taken in a broad sense for \nlending, as in Ecclus. 29:10, where we read: \"Many have refused to \nfenerate, not out of wickedness,\" i.e. they would not lend.

II, iv, de \nUsufructu] it is stated that \"those things according to natural reason \nand civil law which are consumed by being used, do not admit of \nusufruct,\" and that \"the senate did not (nor could it) appoint a usufruct \nto such things, but established a quasi-usufruct,\" namely by permitting \nusury.

Now in all these cases there seems to be \npayment for a loan of money: nor does it appear to be manifestly illicit. \nTherefore it seems to be lawful to expect or exact some consideration for \nmoney lent.\nReply to  He who lends money transfers the ownership of the money to \nthe borrower. Hence the borrower holds the money at his own risk and is \nbound to pay it all back: wherefore the lender must not exact more. On \nthe other hand he that entrusts his money to a merchant or craftsman so \nas to form a kind of society, does not transfer the ownership of his \nmoney to them, for it remains his, so that at his risk the merchant \nspeculates with it, or the craftsman uses it for his craft, and \nconsequently he may lawfully demand as something belonging to him, part \nof the profits derived from his money.\nReply to Objection 6: If a man in return for money lent to him pledges something \nthat can be valued at a price, the lender must allow for the use of that \nthing towards the repayment of the loan.

In like manner if a buyer wishes to buy goods at \na lower price than what is just, for the reason that he pays for the \ngoods before they can be delivered, it is a sin of usury; because again \nthis anticipated payment of money has the character of a loan, the price \nof which is the rebate on the just price of the goods sold.

Wherefore, in the same way as \njustice is a special virtue, as stated above (Question [58], Articles [6],7), omission \nis a special sin distinct from the sins which are opposed to the other \nvirtues; and just as doing good, which is the opposite of omitting it, is \na special part of justice, distinct from avoiding evil, to which \ntransgression is opposed, so too is omission distinct from transgression.",

Now no man is bound to the impossible: \nwherefore no man sins by omission, if he does not do what he cannot. \nAccordingly she who is violated after vowing virginity, is guilty of an \nomission, not through not having virginity, but through not repenting of \nher past sin, or through not doing what she can to fulfil her vow by \nobserving continence. Again a priest is not bound to say Mass, except he \nhave a suitable opportunity, and if this be lacking, there is no \nomission. And in like manner, a person is bound to restitution, supposing \nhe has the wherewithal; if he has not and cannot have it, he is not \nguilty of an omission, provided he does what he can. The same applies to \nother similar cases.",

But it may happen that then one is \nunable to do what one ought, and if this inability is without any fault \non his part, he does not omit his duty, as stated above (ad 2; FS, Question [71], Article [5]). On the other hand if  this inability is due to some previous fault \nof his (for instance, if a man gets drunk at night, and cannot get up for \nmatins, as he ought to), some say that the sin of omission begins when he \nengages in an action that is illicit and incompatible with the act to \nwhich he is bound. But this does not seem to be true, for supposing one \nwere to rouse him by violence and that he went to matins, he would not \nomit to go, so that, evidently, the previous drunkenness was not an \nomission, but the cause of an omission. Consequently, we must say that \nthe omission begins to be imputed to him as a sin, when the time comes \nfor the action; and yet this is on account of a preceding cause by reason \nof which the subsequent omission becomes voluntary.",

        "ANS": "Two points must be observed about the virtues annexed to \na principal virtue. The first is that these virtues have something in \ncommon with the principal virtue; and the second is that in some respect \nthey fall short of the perfection of that virtue. Accordingly since \njustice is of one man to another as stated above (Question [58], Article [2]), all the \nvirtues that are directed to another person may by reason of this common \naspect be annexed to justice. Now the essential character of justice \nconsists in rendering to another his due according to equality, as stated \nabove (Question [58], Article [11]). Wherefore in two ways may a virtue directed to \nanother person fall short of the perfection of justice: first, by falling \nshort of the aspect of equality; secondly, by falling short of the aspect \nof due. For certain virtues there are which render another his due, but \nare unable to render the equal due. In the first place, whatever man \nrenders to God is due, yet it cannot be equal, as though man rendered to \nGod as much as he owes Him, according to Ps. 115:12, \"What shall I render \nto the Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me?\" In this \nrespect \"religion\" is annexed  to justice since, according to Tully (De \ninvent. ii, 53), it consists in offering service and ceremonial rites or \nworship to \"some superior nature that men call divine.\" Secondly, it is \nnot possible to make to one's parents an equal return of what one owes to \nthem, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. viii, 14); and thus \"piety\" is \nannexed to justice, for thereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), a man \n\"renders service and constant deference to his kindred and the \nwell-wishers of his country.\" Thirdly, according to the Philosopher \n(Ethic. iv, 3), man is unable to offer an equal meed for virtue, and thus \n\"observance\" is annexed to justice, consisting according to Tully (De \ninvent. ii, 53) in the \"deference and honor rendered to those who excel \nin worth.\"\nA falling short of the just due may be considered in respect of a \ntwofold due, moral or legal: wherefore the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 13) \nassigns a corresponding twofold just. The legal due is that which one is \nbound to render by reason of a legal obligation; and this due is chiefly \nthe concern of justice, which is the principal virtue. On the other hand, \nthe moral due is that to which one is bound in respect of the rectitude \nof virtue: and since a due implies necessity, this kind of due has two \ndegrees. For one due is so necessary that without it moral rectitude \ncannot be ensured: and this has more of the character of due. Moreover \nthis due may be considered from the point of view of the debtor, and in \nthis way it pertains to this kind of due that a man represent himself to \nothers just as he is, both in word and deed. Wherefore to justice is \nannexed \"truth,\" whereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), present, \npast and future things are told without perversion. It may also be \nconsidered from the point of view of the person to whom it is due, by \ncomparing the reward he receives with what he has done---sometimes in \ngood things; and then annexed to justice we have \"gratitude\" which \n\"consists in recollecting the friendship and kindliness shown by others, \nand in desiring to pay them back,\" as Tully states (De invent. ii, \n53)---and sometimes in evil things, and then to justice is annexed \n\"revenge,\" whereby, as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53), \"we resist \nforce, injury or anything obscure* by taking vengeance or by \nself-defense.\" [*St. Thomas read 'obscurum,' and explains it as meaning \n'derogatory,' infra Question [108], Article [2]. Cicero, however, wrote 'obfuturum,' \ni.e. 'hurtful.']\nThere is another due that is necessary in the sense that it conduces to \ngreater rectitude, although without it rectitude may be ensured.

In this sense three things pertain to friendship, namely, \n\"benevolence\" which is here called \"affection\"; \"concord,\" and \n\"beneficence\" which is here called \"humanity.\" These three, however, are \nomitted by Tully, because, as stated above, they have little of the \nnature of a due.",

In \none way it denotes purity; and this signification fits in with the Greek, \nfor {hagios} means \"unsoiled.\" In another way it denotes firmness, \nwherefore in olden times the term \"sancta\" was applied to such things as \nwere upheld by law and were not to be violated. Hence a thing is said to \nbe sacred [sancitum] when it is ratified by law. Again, in Latin, this \nword \"sanctus\" may be connected with purity, if it be resolved into \n\"sanguine tinctus, since, in olden times, those who wished to be purified \nwere sprinkled with the victim's blood,\" according to Isidore (Etym. x). \nIn either case the signification requires sanctity to be ascribed to \nthose things that are applied to the Divine worship; so that not only \nmen, but also the temple, vessels and such like things are said to be \nsanctified through being applied to the worship of God. For purity is \nnecessary in order that the mind be applied to God, since the human mind \nis soiled by contact with inferior things, even as all things depreciate \nby admixture with baser things, for instance, silver by being mixed with \nlead. Now in order for the mind to be united to the Supreme Being it must \nbe withdrawn from inferior things: and hence it is that without purity \nthe mind cannot be applied to God. Wherefore it is written (Heb. 12:14): \n\"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see \nGod.\" Again, firmness is required for the mind to be applied to God, for \nit is applied to Him as its last end and first beginning, and such things \nmust needs be most immovable. Hence the Apostle said (Rm. 8:38,39): \"I am \nsure that neither death, nor life . . . shall separate me [*Vulg.: 'shall \nbe able to separate us'] from the love of God.\"\nAccordingly, it is by sanctity that the human mind applies itself and \nits acts to God: so that it differs from religion not essentially but \nonly logically.

First, on \nthe part of the object of our petition, because when we pray we ought \nprincipally to ask to be united to God, according to Ps. 26:4, \"One thing \nI have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the \nhouse of the Lord all the days of my life.\" Secondly, on the part of the \npetitioner, who ought to approach the person whom he petitions, either \nlocally, as when he petitions a man, or mentally, as when he petitions \nGod.

There was a third \nopinion of those who held that human affairs are indeed ruled by Divine \nprovidence, and that they do not happen of necessity; yet they deemed the \ndisposition of Divine providence to be changeable, and that it is changed \nby prayers and other things pertaining to the worship of God.

Secondly, that many may thank God for the graces conferred on the \njust, which graces conduce to the profit of many, according to the \nApostle (2 Cor. 1:11).

        "CON": "The authority of Christ, who composed this prayer, \nsuffices.",
        "ANS": "The Lord's Prayer is most perfect, because, as Augustine \nsays (ad Probam Ep. cxxx, 12), \"if we pray rightly and fittingly, we can \nsay nothing else but what is contained in this prayer of our Lord.\" For \nsince prayer interprets our desires, as it were, before God, then alone \nis it right to ask for something in our prayers when it is right that we \nshould desire it. Now in the Lord's Prayer not only do we ask for all \nthat we may rightly desire, but also in the order wherein we ought to \ndesire them, so that this prayer not only teaches us to ask, but also \ndirects all our affections. Thus it is evident that the first thing to be \nthe object of our desire is the end, and afterwards whatever is directed \nto the end. Now our end is God towards Whom our affections tend in two \nways: first, by our willing the glory of God, secondly, by willing to \nenjoy His glory. The first belongs to the love whereby we love God in \nHimself, while the second belongs to the love whereby we love ourselves \nin God. Wherefore the first petition is expressed thus: \"Hallowed be Thy \nname,\" and the second thus: \"Thy kingdom come,\" by which we ask to come \nto the glory of His kingdom.\nTo this same end a thing directs us in two ways: in one way, by its very \nnature, in another way, accidentally. Of its very nature the good which \nis useful for an end directs us to that end. Now a thing is useful in two \nways to that end which is beatitude: in one way, directly and \nprincipally, according to the merit whereby we merit beatitude by obeying \nGod, and in this respect we ask: \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in \nheaven\"; in another way instrumentally, and as it were helping us to \nmerit, and in this respect we say: \"Give us this day our daily bread,\" \nwhether we understand this of the sacramental Bread, the daily use of \nwhich is profitable to man, and in which all the other sacraments are \ncontained, or of the bread of the body, so that it denotes all \nsufficiency of food, as Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11), since \nthe Eucharist is the chief sacrament, and bread is the chief food: thus \nin the Gospel of Matthew we read, \"supersubstantial,\" i.e. \"principal,\" \nas Jerome expounds it.\nWe are directed to beatitude accidentally by the removal of obstacles. \nNow there are three obstacles to our attainment of beatitude. First, \nthere is sin, which directly excludes a man from the kingdom, according \nto 1 Cor. 6:9,10, \"Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, etc., shall \npossess the kingdom of God\"; and to this refer the words, \"Forgive us our \ntrespasses.\" Secondly, there is temptation which hinders us from keeping \nGod's will, and to this we refer when we say: \"And lead us not into \ntemptation,\" whereby we do not ask not to be tempted, but not to be \nconquered by temptation, which is to be led into temptation. Thirdly, \nthere is the present penal state which is a kind of obstacle to a \nsufficiency of life, and to this we refer in the words, \"Deliver us from \nevil.\"",
        "RP1": "As Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 5), when we \nsay, \"Hallowed be Thy name, we do not mean that God's name is not holy, \nbut we ask that men may treat it as a holy thing,\" and this pertains to \nthe diffusion of God's glory among men. When we say, \"Thy kingdom come, \nwe do not imply that God is not reigning now,\" but \"we excite in \nourselves the desire for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that \nwe may reign therein,\" as Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11). The \nwords, \"Thy will be done rightly signify, 'May Thy commandments be \nobeyed' on earth as in heaven, i.e. by men as well as by angels\" (De \nSerm. Dom. in Monte ii, 6). Hence these three petitions will be perfectly \nfulfilled in the life to come; while the other four, according to \nAugustine (Enchiridion cxv), belong to the needs of the present life",

If it is piety whereby blessed are \nthe meek, let us ask that His kingdom may come, so that we become meek \nand no longer resist Him.

Common prayer \nis that which is offered to God by the ministers of the Church \nrepresenting the body of the faithful: wherefore such like prayer should \ncome to the knowledge of the whole people for whom it is offered: and \nthis would not be possible unless it were vocal prayer.

And yet the voice is \nemployed in such like prayers for three reasons. First, in order to \nexcite interior devotion, whereby the mind of the person praying is \nraised to God, because by means of external signs, whether of words or of \ndeeds, the human mind is moved as regards apprehension, and consequently \nalso as regards the affections. Hence Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. \ncxxx, 9) that \"by means of words and other signs we arouse ourselves more \neffectively to an increase of holy desires.\" Hence then alone should we \nuse words and such like signs when they help to excite the mind \ninternally. But if they distract or in any way impede the mind we should \nabstain from them; and this happens chiefly to those whose mind is \nsufficiently prepared for devotion without having recourse to those \nsigns. Wherefore the Psalmist (Ps. 26:8) said: \"My heart hath said to \nThee: 'My face hath sought Thee,'\" and we read of Anna (1 Kgs. 1:13) that \n\"she spoke in her heart.\" Secondly, the voice is used in praying as \nthough to pay a debt, so that man may serve God with all that he has from \nGod, that is to say, not only with his mind, but also with his body: and \nthis applies to prayer considered especially as satisfactory. Hence it is \nwritten (Osee 14:3): \"Take away all iniquity, and receive the good: and \nwe will render the calves of our lips.\" Thirdly, we have recourse to \nvocal prayer, through a certain overflow from the soul into the body, \nthrough excess of feeling, according to Ps. 15:9, \"My heart hath been \nglad, and my tongue hath rejoiced.\"",

First, \na thing is necessary because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus \nattention is absolutely necessary for prayer. Secondly, a thing is said \nto be necessary when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now \nthe effect of prayer is threefold. The first is an effect which is common \nto all acts quickened by  charity, and this is merit. In order to realize \nthis effect, it is not necessary that prayer should be attentive \nthroughout; because the force of the original intention with which one \nsets about praying renders the whole prayer meritorious, as is the case \nwith other meritorious acts. The second effect of prayer is proper \nthereto, and consists in impetration: and again the original intention, \nto which God looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the \noriginal intention is lacking, prayer lacks both merit and impetration: \nbecause, as Gregory [*Hugh St. Victor, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, \n\"God hears not the prayer of those who pay no attention to their prayer.\" \nThe third effect of prayer is that which it produces at once; this is the \nspiritual refreshment of the mind, and for this effect attention is a \nnecessary condition: wherefore it is written (1 Cor. 14:14): \"If I pray \nin a tongue . . . my understanding is without fruit.\"\nIt must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention \nthat can be brought to vocal prayer: one which attends to the words, lest \nwe say them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a \nthird, which attends to the end of prayer, namely, God, and to the thing \nwe are praying for. That last kind of attention is most necessary, and \neven idiots are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the mind \nis fixed on God, is sometimes so strong that the mind forgets all other \nthings, as Hugh of St. Victor states [*De Modo Orandi ii].",

Monach. i): \"If you are so truly weakened \nby sin that you are unable to pray attentively, strive as much as you can \nto curb yourself, and God will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to \nstand in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but \nthrough frailty.\""

        "ANS": "We may speak about prayer in two ways: first, by \nconsidering it in itself; secondly, by considering it in its cause. The \nnot cause of prayer is the desire of charity, from which prayer ought to \narise: and this desire ought to be in us continually, either actually or \nvirtually, for the virtue of this desire remains in whatever we do out of \ncharity; and we ought to \"do all things to the glory of God\" (1 Cor. 10:31). From this point of view prayer ought to be continual: wherefore \nAugustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 9): \"Faith, hope and charity are by \nthemselves a prayer of continual longing.\" But prayer, considered in \nitself, cannot be continual, because we have to be busy about other \nworks, and, as Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9), \"we pray to God \nwith our lips at certain intervals and seasons, in order to admonish \nourselves by means of such like signs, to take note of the amount of our \nprogress in that desire, and to arouse ourselves more eagerly to an \nincrease thereof.\" Now the quantity of a thing should be commensurate \nwith its end, for instance the quantity of the dose should be \ncommensurate with health. And so it is becoming that prayer should last \nlong enough to arouse the fervor of the interior desire: and when it \nexceeds this measure, so that it cannot be continued any longer without \ncausing weariness, it should be discontinued. Wherefore Augustine says \n(ad Probam. Ep. cxxx): \"It is said that the brethren in Egypt make \nfrequent but very short prayers, rapid ejaculations, as it were, lest \nthat vigilant and erect attention which is so necessary in prayer slacken \nand languish, through the strain being prolonged. By so doing they make \nit sufficiently clear not only that this attention must not be forced if \nwe are unable to keep it up, but also that if we are able to continue, it \nshould not be broken off too soon.\" And just as we must judge of this in \nprivate prayers by considering the attention of the person praying, so \ntoo, in public prayers we must judge of it by considering the devotion of \nthe people.",

For to say much in prayer is to \ndiscuss your need in too many words: whereas to pray much is to knock at \nthe door of Him we pray, by the continuous and devout clamor of the \nheart.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [13]) prayer, besides causing spiritual \nconsolation at the time of praying, has a twofold efficacy in respect of \na future effect, namely, efficacy in meriting and efficacy in \nimpetrating. Now prayer, like any other virtuous act, is efficacious in \nmeriting, because it proceeds from charity as its root, the proper object \nof which is the eternal good that we merit to enjoy. Yet prayer proceeds \nfrom charity through the medium of religion, of which prayer is an act, \nas stated above (Article [3]), and with the concurrence of other virtues \nrequisite for the goodness of prayer, viz. humility and faith. For the \noffering of prayer itself to God belongs to religion, while the desire \nfor the thing. that we pray to be accomplished belongs to charity. Faith \nis necessary in reference to God to Whom we pray; that is, we need to \nbelieve that we can obtain from Him what we seek. Humility is necessary \non the part of the person praying, because he recognizes his neediness. \nDevotion too is necessary: but this belongs to religion, for it is its \nfirst act and a necessary condition of all its secondary acts, as stated \nabove (Question [82], Articles [1],2).\nAs to its efficacy in impetrating, prayer derives this from the grace of \nGod to Whom we pray, and Who instigates us to pray. Wherefore Augustine \nsays (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cv, 1): \"He would not urge us to ask, unless \nHe were willing to give\"; and Chrysostom [*Cf. Catena Aurea of St. Thomas \non Lk. 18. The words as quoted are not to be found in the words of \nChrysostom] says: \"He never refuses to grant our prayers, since in His \nloving-kindness He urged us not to faint in praying.\"",
        "RP1": "Neither prayer nor any other virtuous act is meritorious \nwithout sanctifying grace. And yet even that prayer which impetrates \nsanctifying grace proceeds from some grace, as from a gratuitous gift, \nsince the very act of praying is \"a gift of God,\" as Augustine states (De \nPersever. xxiii).",
        "RP2": "Sometimes the merit of prayer regards chiefly something \ndistinct from the object of one's petition. For the chief object of merit \nis beatitude, whereas the direct object of the petition of prayer extends \nsometimes to certain other things, as stated above (Articles [6],7). Accordingly \nif this other thing that we ask for ourselves be not useful for our \nbeatitude, we do not merit it; and sometimes by asking for and desiring \nsuch things we lose merit for instance if we ask of God the \naccomplishment of some sin, which would be an impious prayer. And \nsometimes it is not necessary for salvation, nor yet manifestly contrary \nthereto; and then although he who prays may merit eternal life by \npraying, yet he does not merit to obtain what he asks for. Hence \nAugustine says (Liber. Sentent. Prosperi sent. ccxii): \"He who faithfully \nprays God for the necessaries of this life, is both mercifully heard, and \nmercifully not heard. For the physician knows better than the sick man \nwhat is good for the disease.\" For this reason, too, Paul was not heard \nwhen he prayed for the removal of the sting in his flesh, because this \nwas not expedient. If, however, we pray for something  that is useful for \nour beatitude, through being conducive to salvation, we merit it not only \nby praying, but also by doing other good deeds: therefore without any \ndoubt we receive what we ask for, yet when we ought to receive it: \"since \ncertain things are not denied us, but are deferred that they may be \ngranted at a suitable time,\" according to Augustine (Tract. cii in \nJoan.): and again this may be hindered if we persevere not in asking for \nit. Wherefore Basil says (De Constit. Monast. i): \"The reason why \nsometimes thou hast asked and not received, is because thou hast asked \namiss, either inconsistently, or lightly, or because thou hast asked for \nwhat was not good for thee, or because thou hast ceased asking.\" Since, \nhowever, a man cannot condignly merit eternal life for another, as stated \nabove (FS, Question [114], Article [6]), it follows that sometimes one cannot condignly \nmerit for another things that pertain to eternal life. For this reason we \nare not always heard when we pray for others, as stated above (Article [7], ad 2,3). Hence it is that four conditions are laid down; namely, to \nask---\"for ourselves---things necessary for \nsalvation---piously---perseveringly\"; when all these four concur, we \nalways obtain what we ask for.",
        "RP3": "Prayer depends chiefly on faith, not for its efficacy in \nmeriting, because thus it depends chiefly on charity, but for its \nefficacy in impetrating, because it is through faith that man comes to \nknow of God's omnipotence and mercy, which are the source whence prayer \nimpetrates what it asks for."

The \nreason of impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of \nwhich we ask to be heard, according to Dan. 9:17,18, \"For Thy own sake, \nincline, O God, Thy ear\"; and to this pertains \"supplication\" \n[obsecratio] which means a pleading through sacred things, as when we \nsay, \"Through Thy nativity, deliver us, O Lord.\" The reason for \nimpetration on the part of the person who asks is \"thanksgiving\"; since \n\"through giving thanks for benefits received we merit to receive yet \ngreater benefits,\" as we say in the collect [*Ember Friday in September \nand Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor Bishop]. Hence a gloss on \n1 Tim. 2:1 says that \"in the Mass, the consecration is preceded by \nsupplication,\" in which certain sacred things are called to mind; that \n\"prayers are in the consecration itself,\" in which especially the mind \nshould be raised up to God; and that \"intercessions are in the petitions \nthat follow, and thanksgivings at the end.\"\nWe may notice these four things in several of the Church's collects. \nThus in the collect of Trinity Sunday the words, \"Almighty eternal God\" \nbelong to the offering up of prayer to God; the words, \"Who hast given to \nThy servants,\" etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, \"grant, we beseech \nThee,\" belong to intercession; and the words at the end, \"Through Our \nLord,\" etc. belong to supplication.\nIn the \"Conferences of the Fathers\" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we  read: \n\"Supplication is bewailing one's sins; prayer is vowing something to God; \nintercession is praying for others; thanksgiving is offered by the mind \nto God in ineffable ecstasy.\" The first explanation, however, is the \nbetter.",

And since external actions are signs of internal \nreverence, certain external tokens significative of reverence are offered \nto creatures of excellence, and among these tokens the chief is \nadoration: yet there is one thing which is offered to God alone, and that \nis sacrifice. Hence Augustine says (De Civ.

It was with the reverence due to God that \nJohn was forbidden to adore the angel (Apoc. 22:9), both to indicate the \ndignity which he had acquired through Christ, whereby man is made equal \nto an angel: wherefore the same text goes on: \"I am thy fellow-servant \nand of thy brethren\"; as also to exclude any occasion of idolatry, \nwherefore the text continues: \"Adore God.\"",

Secondly, on account of the sacred mysteries and other signs of \nholiness contained therein. Thirdly, on account of the concourse of many \nadorers, by reason of which their prayer is more likely to be heard, \naccording to Mt. 18:20, \"Where there are two or three gathered together \nin My name, there am I in the midst of them.\"",

Things that are of the natural law are common among all men. \nYet this is not the case with sacrifices: for we read of some, e.g. \nMelchisedech (Gn. 14:18), offering bread and wine in sacrifice, and of \ncertain animals being offered by some, and others by others. Therefore \nthe offering of sacrifices is not of the natural law.",
        "OB2": "Further, things that are of the natural law were observed by all \njust men. Yet we do not read that Isaac offered sacrifice; nor that Adam \ndid so, of whom nevertheless it is written (Wis. 10:2) that wisdom \n\"brought him out of his sin.\" Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not \nof the natural law.",
        "OB3": "Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 5,19) that sacrifices are \noffered in signification of something. Now words which are chief among \nsigns, as he again says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), \"signify, not by \nnature but by convention,\" according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm. i, \n2). Therefore sacrifices are not of  the natural law.",

Now \njust as in natural things the lower are naturally subject to the higher, \nso too it is a dictate of natural reason in accordance with man's natural \ninclination that he should tender submission and honor, according to his \nmode, to that which is above man. Now the mode befitting to man is that \nhe should employ sensible signs in order to signify anything, because he \nderives his knowledge from sensibles. Hence it is a dictate of natural \nreason that man should use certain sensibles, by offering them to God in \nsign of the subjection and honor due to Him, like those who make certain \nofferings to their lord in recognition of his authority. Now this is what \nwe mean by a sacrifice, and consequently the offering of sacrifice is of \nthe natural law.",
        "RP1": "As stated above (FS, Question [95], Article [2]), certain things belong \ngenerically to the natural law, while their determination belongs to the \npositive law; thus the natural law requires that evildoers should be \npunished; but that this or that punishment should be inflicted on them is \na matter determined by God or by man. In like manner the offering of \nsacrifice belongs generically to the natural law, and consequently all \nare agreed on this point, but the determination of sacrifices is \nestablished by God or by man, and this is the reason for their difference.",

Nor does Scripture mention all the \nsacrifices of the just, but only those that have something special \nconnected with them. Perhaps the reason why we read of no sacrifice being \noffered by Adam may be that, as the origin of sin is ascribed to him, the \norigin of sanctification ought not to be represented as typified in him. \nIsaac was a type of Christ, being himself offered in sacrifice; and so \nthere was no need that he should be represented as offering a sacrifice.",

Accordingly, sacrifice is a special \nact deserving of praise in that it is done out of reverence for God; and \nfor this reason it belongs to a definite virtue, viz. religion. But it \nhappens that the acts of the other virtues are directed to the reverence \nof God, as when a man gives alms of his own things for God's sake, or \nwhen a man subjects his own body to some affliction out of reverence for \nGod; and in this way the acts also of other virtues may be called \nsacrifices.

The third is the good which \nconsists of external things: and of these we offer a sacrifice to God, \ndirectly when we offer our possession to God immediately, and indirectly \nwhen we share them with our neighbor for God's sake.",
        "RP3": "A \"sacrifice,\" properly speaking, requires that something \nbe done to the thing which is offered to God, for instance animals were \nslain and burnt, the bread is broken, eaten, blessed. The very word \nsignifies this, since \"sacrifice\" is so called because a man does \nsomething sacred [facit sacrum]. On the other hand an \"oblation\" is \nproperly the offering of something to God even if nothing be done \nthereto, thus we speak of offering money or bread at the altar, and yet \nnothing is done to them. Hence every sacrifice is an oblation, but not \nconversely. \"First-fruits\" are oblations, because they were offered to \nGod, according to Dt. 26, but they are not a sacrifice, because nothing \nsacred was done to them. \"Tithes,\" however, are neither a sacrifice nor \nan oblation, properly speaking, because they are not offered immediately \nto God, but to the ministers of Divine worship."

Secondly, on account of contempt, wherefore the same \ntext goes on (Malach. 1:12): \"You have profaned\" My name, \"in that you \nsay: The table of the Lord is defiled and that which is laid thereupon is \ncontemptible.\" Thirdly, on account of a previous vow, whereby a man has \nbound himself to offer without blemish whatever he has vowed: hence the \nsame text says further on (Malach. 1:14): \"Cursed is the deceitful man \nthat hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice \nthat which is feeble to the Lord.\" The same reasons avail still in the \nNew Law, but when they do not apply the unlawfulness ceases."

Now, as stated above (FS, \nQuestion [103], Article [3]; FS, Question [104], Article [3]), during the time of grace men are hound \nneither  to the ceremonial nor to the judicial precepts of the Old Law. \nTherefore men are not bound now to pay tithes.",

Therefore during the time \nof grace men are not bound under necessity of precept to pay tithes.\nReply to  The ministers of the Church ought to be more solicitous for \nthe increase of spiritual goods in the people, than for the amassing of \ntemporal goods: and hence the Apostle was unwilling to make use of the \nright given him by the Lord of  receiving his livelihood from those to \nwhom he preached the Gospel, lest he should occasion a hindrance to the \nGospel of Christ [*1 Cor. 9:12]. Nor did they sin who did not contribute \nto his upkeep, else the Apostle would not have omitted to reprove them. \nIn like manner the ministers of the Church rightly refrain from demanding \nthe Church's tithes, when they could not demand them without scandal, on \naccount of their having fallen into desuetude, or for some other reason. \nNevertheless those who do not give tithes in places where the Church does \nnot demand them are not in a state of damnation, unless they be \nobstinate, and unwilling to pay even if tithes were demanded of them.",

        "ANS": "In the Old Law tithes were paid for the sustenance of the \nministers of God. Hence it is written (Malach. 3:10): \"Bring all the \ntithes into My [Vulg.: 'the'] store-house that there may be meat in My \nhouse.\" Hence the precept about the paying of tithes was partly moral and \ninstilled in the natural reason; and partly judicial, deriving its force \nfrom its divine institution. Because natural reason dictates that the \npeople should administer the necessaries of life to those who minister \nthe divine worship for the welfare of the whole people even as it is the \npeople's duty to provide a livelihood for their rulers and soldiers and \nso forth. Hence the Apostle proves this from human custom, saying (1 Cor. 9:7): \"Who serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charge? Who \nplanteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof?\" But the fixing \nof the proportion to be offered to the ministers of divine worship does \nnot belong to the natural law, but was determined by divine institution, \nin accordance with the condition of that people to whom the law was being \ngiven. For they were divided into twelve tribes, and the twelfth tribe, \nnamely that of Levi, was engaged exclusively in the divine ministry and \nhad no possessions whence to derive a livelihood: and so it was \nbecomingly ordained that the remaining eleven tribes should give \none-tenth part of their revenues to the Levites [*Num. 18:21] that the \nlatter might live respectably; and also because some, through negligence, \nwould disregard this precept. Hence, so far as the tenth part was fixed, \nthe precept was judicial, since all institutions established among this \npeople for the special purpose of preserving equality among men, in \naccordance with this people's condition, are called \"judicial precepts.\" \nNevertheless by way of consequence these institutions foreshadowed \nsomething in the future, even as everything else connected with them, \naccording to 1 Cor. 12, \"All these things happened to them in figure.\" In \nthis respect they had something in common with the \"ceremonial precepts,\" \nwhich were instituted chiefly that they might be signs of the future. \nHence the precept about paying tithes foreshadowed something in the \nfuture. For ten is, in a way, the perfect number (being the first \nnumerical limit, since the figures do not go beyond ten but begin over \nagain from one), and therefore he that gave a tenth, which is the sign of \nperfection, reserving the nine other parts for himself, acknowledged by a \nsign that imperfection was his part, and that the perfection which was to \ncome through Christ was to be hoped for from God. Yet this proves it to \nbe, not a ceremonial but a judicial precept, as stated above.\nThere is this difference between the ceremonial and judicial precepts of \nthe Law, as we stated above (FS, Question [104], Article [3]), that it is unlawful to \nobserve the ceremonial precepts at the time of the New Law, whereas there \nis no sin in keeping the judicial precepts during the time of grace \nalthough they are not binding. Indeed they are bound to be observed by \nsome, if they be ordained by the authority of those who have power to \nmake laws. Thus it was a judicial precept of the Old Law that he who \nstole a sheep should restore four sheep (Ex. 22:1), and if any king were \nto order this  to be done his subjects would be bound to obey. In like \nmanner during the time of the New Law the authority of the Church has \nestablished the payment of tithe; thus showing a certain kindliness, lest \nthe people of the New Law should give less to the ministers of the New \nTestament than did the people of the Old Law to the ministers of the Old \nTestament; for the people of the New Law are under greater obligations, \naccording to Mt. 5:20, \"Unless your justice abound more than that of the \nScribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,\" \nand, moreover, the ministers of the New Testament are of greater dignity \nthan the ministers of the Old Testament, as the Apostle shows (2 Cor. 3:7,8).\nAccordingly it is evident that man's obligation to pay tithes arises \npartly from natural law, partly from the institution of the Church; who, \nnevertheless, in consideration of the requirements of time and persons \nmight ordain the payment of some other proportion.\nThis suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.",

        "RP1": "In accordance with the condition of that people there was a \nspecial reason why the Old Law did not include a precept about personal \ntithes; because, to wit, all the other tribes had certain possessions \nwherewith they were able to provide a sufficient livelihood for the \nLevites who had no possessions, but were not forbidden to make a profit \nout of other lawful occupations as the other Jews did. On the other hand \nthe people of the New Law are spread abroad throughout the world, and \nmany of them have no possessions, but live by trade, and these would \ncontribute nothing to the support of God's ministers if they did not pay \ntithes on their trade profits.

If, however, a field be bought with the profits of \nusury, the usurer is bound to pay tithes on the produce, because the \nlatter is not gotten usuriously but given by God. On the other hand \ncertain things are said to be ill-gotten, because they are gotten of a \nshameful cause, for instance of whoredom or stage-playing, and the like. \nSuch things a man is not bound to restore, and consequently he is bound \nto pay tithes on them in the same way as other personal tithes. \nNevertheless the Church must not accept the tithe so long as those \npersons remain in sin, lest she appear to have a share in their sins: but \nwhen they have done penance, tithes may be accepted from them on these \nthings.",
        "RP3": "Things directed to an end must be judged according to their \nfittingness to the end. Now the payment of tithes is due not for its own \nsake, but for the sake of the ministers, to whose dignity it is \nunbecoming that they should demand minute things with careful exactitude, \nfor this is reckoned sinful according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 2). \nHence the Old Law did not order the payment of tithes on such like minute \nthings, but left it to the judgment of those who are willing to pay, \nbecause minute things are counted as nothing. Wherefore the Pharisees who \nclaimed for themselves the perfect justice of the Law, paid tithes even \non these minute things: nor are they reproved by our Lord on that \naccount, but only because they despised  greater, i.e. spiritual, \nprecepts; and rather did He show them to be deserving of praise in this \nparticular, when He said (Mt. 23:23): \"These things you ought to have \ndone,\" i.e. during the time of the Law, according to Chrysostom's [*Hom. \nxliv in the Opus Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] \ncommentary.

        "RP4": "A man is not bound to pay tithes on what he has lost by \ntheft or robbery, before he recovers his property: unless he has incurred \nthe loss through his own fault or neglect, because the Church ought not \nto be the loser on that account. If he sell wheat that has not been \ntithed, the Church can command the tithes due to her, both from the buyer \nwho has a thing due to the Church, and from the seller, because so far as \nhe is concerned he has defrauded the Church: yet if one pays, the other \nis not bound. Tithes are due on the fruits of the earth, in so far as \nthese fruits are the gift of God. Wherefore tithes do not come under a \ntax, nor are they subject to workmen's wages. Hence it is not right to \ndeduct one's taxes and the wages paid to workmen, before paying tithes: \nbut tithes must be paid before anything else on one's entire produce."

        "OB3": "Further, in the eighteenth chapter of Numbers (26,28), it is \nprescribed not only that the Levites should receive tithes from the \npeople, but also that they should themselves pay tithes to the \nhigh-priest. Therefore the clergy are bound to pay tithes to the \nSovereign Pontiff, no less than the laity are bound to pay tithes to the \nclergy.",

Now tithes are due to the clergy as being ministers of the altar \nand sowers of spiritual things among the people. Wherefore those members \nof the clergy as such, i.e. as having ecclesiastical property, are not \nbound to pay tithes; whereas from some other cause through holding \nproperty in their own right, either by inheriting it from their kindred, \nor by purchase, or in any other similar manner, they are bound to the \npayment of tithes.\nHence the Reply to the First Objection is clear, because the clergy like \nanyone else are bound to pay tithes on their own lands to the parish \nchurch, even though they be the clergy of that same church, because to \npossess a thing as one's private property is not the same as possessing \nit in common.

Another reason applies to other religious, who \nthough clerics do not dispense spiritual things to the people; for \naccording to the ordinary law they are  bound to pay tithes, but they are \nsomewhat exempt by reason of various concessions granted by the Apostolic \nSee [*Cap.

        "OB1": "It would seem that a vow consists in nothing but a purpose of the \nwill. According to some [*William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III, xxviii, qu. \n1; Albertus Magnus, Sent. iv, D, 38], \"a vow is a conception of a good \npurpose after a firm deliberation of the mind, whereby a man binds \nhimself before God to do or not to do a certain thing.\" But the \nconception of a good purpose and so forth, may consist in a mere movement \nof the will. Therefore a vow consists in a mere purpose of the will.",
        "OB2": "Further, the very word vow seems to be derived from \"voluntas\" \n[will], for one is said to do a thing \"proprio voto\" [by one's own vow] \nwhen one does it voluntarily. Now to \"purpose\" is an act of the will, \nwhile to \"promise\" is an act of the reason. Therefore a vow consists in a \nmere act of the will.",
        "OB3": "Further, our Lord said (Lk. 9:62): \"No man putting his hand to \nthe plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\" Now from \nthe very fact that a man has a purpose of doing good, he puts his hand to \nthe plough. Consequently, if he look back by desisting from his good \npurpose, he is not fit for the kingdom of God. Therefore by a mere good \npurpose a man is bound before God, even without making a promise; and \nconsequently it would seem that a vow consists in a mere purpose of the \nwill.",
        "CON": "It is written (Eccles. 5:3): \"If thou hast vowed \nanything to God, defer not to pay it, for an unfaithful and foolish \npromise displeaseth Him.\" Therefore to vow is to promise, and a vow is a \npromise.",
        "ANS": "A vow denotes a binding to do or omit some particular \nthing. Now one man binds himself to another by means of a promise, which \nis an act of the reason to which faculty it belongs to direct. For just \nas a man by commanding or praying, directs, in a fashion, what others are \nto do for him, so by promising he directs what he himself is to do for \nanother. Now a promise between man and man can only be expressed in words \nor any other outward signs; whereas a promise can be made to God by the \nmere inward thought, since according to 1 Kgs. 16:7, \"Man seeth those \nthings that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.\" Yet we express \nwords outwardly sometimes, either to arouse ourselves, as was stated \nabove with regard to prayer (Question [83], Article [12]), or to call others to witness, \nso that one may refrain from breaking the vow, not only through fear of \nGod, but also through respect of men. Now a promise is the outcome from a \npurpose of doing something: and a purpose presupposes deliberation, since \nit is the act of a deliberate will. Accordingly three things are \nessential to a vow: the first is deliberation. the second is a purpose of \nthe will; and the third is a promise, wherein is completed the nature of \na vow. Sometimes, however, two other things are added as a sort of \nconfirmation of the vow, namely, pronouncement by word of mouth, \naccording to Ps. 65:13, \"I will pay Thee my vows which my lips have \nuttered\"; and the witnessing of others. Hence the Master says (Sent. iv, \nD, 38) that a vow is \"the witnessing of a spontaneous promise and ought \nto be made to God and about things relating to God\": although the \n\"witnessing\" may strictly refer to the inward protestation.",

But vows are not \nonly about matters of supererogation, but also about matters of \nsalvation: thus in Baptism men vow to renounce the devil and his pomps, \nand to keep the faith, as a gloss observes on Ps. 75:12, \"Vow ye, and pay \nto the Lord your God\"; and Jacob vowed (Gn. 28:21) that the Lord should \nbe his God. Now this above all is necessary for salvation. Therefore vows \nare not only about a better good.",

Since, \nthen, the slaying of an innocent person is not a better good, but is in \nitself unlawful, it seems that a vow may be made not only about a better \ngood, but also about something unlawful.",
        "OB3": "Further, things that tend to be harmful to the person, or that \nare quite useless, do not come under the head of a better good. Yet \nsometimes vows are made about immoderate vigils or fasts which tend to \ninjure the person: and sometimes vows are about indifferent matters and \nsuch as are useful to no purpose.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [1]), a vow is a promise made to God. \nNow a promise is about something that one does voluntarily for someone \nelse: since it would be not a promise but a threat to say that one would \ndo something against someone. In like manner it would be futile to \npromise anyone something unacceptable to him. Wherefore, as every sin is \nagainst God, and since no work is acceptable to God unless it be \nvirtuous, it follows that nothing unlawful or indifferent, but only some \nact of virtue, should be the matter of a vow. But as a vow denotes a \nvoluntary promise, while necessity excludes voluntariness, whatever is \nabsolutely necessary, whether to be or not to be, can nowise be the \nmatter of a vow. For it would be foolish to vow that one would die or \nthat one would not fly.\nOn the other hand, if a thing be necessary. not absolutely but on the \nsupposition of an end---for instance if salvation be unattainable without \nit---it may be the matter of a vow in so far as it is done voluntarily, \nbut not in so far as there is a necessity for doing it. But that which is \nnot necessary, neither absolutely, nor on the supposition of an end, is \naltogether voluntary, and therefore is most properly the matter of a vow. \nAnd this is said to be a greater good in comparison with that which is \nuniversally necessary for salvation. Therefore, properly speaking, a vow \nis said to be about a better good.",

The same \nanswer applies to Jacob's vow: although it may also be explained that \nJacob vowed that he would have the Lord for his God, by giving Him a \nspecial form of worship to which he was not bound, for instance by \noffering tithes and so forth as mentioned further on in the same passage.",
        "RP2": "Certain things are good, whatever be their result; such are \nacts of virtue, and these can be, absolutely speaking, the matter of a \nvow: some are evil, whatever their result may be; as those things which \nare sins in themselves, and these can nowise be the matter of a vow: \nwhile some, considered in themselves, are good, and as such may be the \nmatter of a vow, yet they may have an evil result, in which case the vow \nmust not be kept. It was thus with the vow of Jephte, who as related in \nJudges 11:30,31, \"made a vow to the Lord, saying: If Thou wilt deliver \nthe children of Ammon into my hands, whosoever shall first come forth out \nof the doors of my house, and shall meet me when I return in peace . . . \nthe same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.\" For this could have an \nevil result if, as indeed happened, he were to be met by some animal \nwhich it would be unlawful to sacrifice, such as an ass or a human being. \nHence Jerome says [*Implicitly 1 Contra Jovin.: Comment. in Micheam vi, \nviii: Comment. in Jerem. vii. The quotation is from Peter Comestor, Hist. \nScholast.]: \"In vowing he was foolish, through lack of discretion, and in \nkeeping his vow he was wicked.\" Yet it is premised (Judges 11:29) that \n\"the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,\" because his faith and devotion, \nwhich moved him to make that vow, were from the Holy Ghost; and for this \nreason he is reckoned among the saints, as also by reason of the victory \nwhich he obtained, and because it is probable that he repented of his \nsinful deed, which nevertheless foreshadowed something good.",
        "RP3": "The mortification of one's own body, for instance by vigils \nand fasting, is not acceptable to God except in so far as it is an act of \nvirtue; and this depends on its being done with due discretion, namely, \nthat concupiscence be curbed without overburdening nature. on this \ncondition such things may be the matter of a vow. Hence the Apostle after \nsaying (Rm. 12:1), \"Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, \npleasing to God,\"  adds, \"your reasonable service.\" Since, however, man \nis easily mistaken in judging of matters concerning himself, such vows as \nthese are more fittingly kept or disregarded according to the judgment of \na superior, yet so that, should a man find that without doubt he is \nseriously burdened by keeping such a vow, and should he be unable to \nappeal to his superior, he ought not to keep it. As to vows about vain \nand useless things they should be ridiculed rather than kept."

Now according to the prescription of human laws \n[*Dig. L. xii, de pollicitat., i] a simple promise made to a man is not \nbinding; and this seems to be prescribed on account of the changeableness \nof the human will. Much less binding therefore is a simple promise made \nto God, which we call a vow.",
        "OB2": "Further, no one is bound to do what is impossible. Now sometimes \nthat which a man has vowed becomes impossible to him, either because it \ndepends on another's decision, as when, for instance, a man vows to enter \na monastery, the monks of which refuse to receive him: or on account of \nsome defect arising, for instance when a woman vows virginity, and \nafterwards is deflowered; or when a man vows to give a sum of money, and \nafterwards loses it. Therefore a vow is not always binding.",
        "OB3": "Further, if a man is bound to pay something, he must do so at \nonce. But a man is not bound to pay his vow at once, especially if it be \ntaken under a condition to be fulfilled in the future. Therefore a vow is \nnot always binding.",

Now man ought to be faithful to God above all, both on account of \nGod's sovereignty, and on account of the favors he has received from God. \nHence man is obliged before all to fulfill the vows he has made to God, \nsince this is part of the fidelity he owes to God. On the other hand, the \nbreaking of a vow is a kind of infidelity.

Hence the works of \nthe other moral virtues (for instance, fasting, which is an act of \nabstinence; and being continent, which is an act of chastity) are better \nand more meritorious, if they be done in fulfilment of a vow, since thus \nthey belong to the divine worship, being like sacrifices to God. \nWherefore Augustine says (De Virg. viii) that \"not even is virginity \nhonorable as such, but only when it is consecrated to God, and cherished \nby godly continence.\"\nSecondly, because he that vows something and does it, subjects himself \nto God more than he that only does it; for he subjects himself to God not \nonly as to the act, but also as to the power, since in future he cannot \ndo something else. Even so he gives more who gives the tree with its \nfruit, than he that gives the fruit only, as Anselm [*Eadmer] observes \n(De Simil. viii). For this reason, we thank even those who promise, as \nstated above (Article [5], ad 2).\nThirdly, because a vow fixes the will on the good immovably and to do \nanything of a will that is fixed on the good belongs to the perfection of \nvirtue, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 4), just as to sin with \nan obstinate mind aggravates the sin, and is called a sin against the \nHoly Ghost, as stated above (Question [14], Article [2]).",
        "RP1": "The passage quoted should be understood as referring to \nnecessity of coercion which causes an act to be involuntary and excludes \ndevotion. Hence he says pointedly: \"Lest that which we are free to do be \ndone without devotion and unwillingly.\" On the other hand the necessity \nresulting from a vow is caused by the immobility of the will, wherefore \nit strengthens the will and increases devotion. Hence the argument does \nnot conclude.",
        "RP2": "According to the Philosopher, necessity of coercion, in so \nfar as it is opposed to the will, causes sorrow. But the necessity \nresulting from a vow, in those who are well disposed, in so far as it \nstrengthens the will, causes not sorrow but joy. Hence Augustine says \n(Ep. ad Arment. et Paulin. cxxcii): \"Repent not of thy vow: thou shouldst \nrather rejoice that thou canst no longer do what thou mightest lawfully \nhave done to thy  detriment.\" If, however, the very deed, considered in \nitself, were to become disagreeable and involuntary after one has taken \nthe vow, the will to fulfil it remaining withal, it is still more \nmeritorious than if it were done without the vow, since the fulfilment of \na vow is an act of religion which is a greater virtue than abstinence, of \nwhich fasting is an act.",
        "RP3": "He who does something without having vowed it has an \nimmovable will as regards the individual deed which he does and at the \ntime when he does it; but his will does not remain altogether fixed for \nthe time to come, as does the will of one who makes a vow: for the latter \nhas bound his will to do something, both before he did that particular \ndeed, and perchance to do it many times."

Now a vow is a promise made to God: wherefore, the solemnization \nof a vow consists in  something spiritual pertaining to God; i.e. in some \nspiritual blessing or consecration which, in accordance with the \ninstitution of the apostles, is given when a man makes profession of \nobserving a certain rule, in the second degree after the reception of \nholy orders, as Dionysius states (Eccl. Hier. vi). The reason of this is \nthat solemnization is not wont to be employed, save when a man gives \nhimself up entirely to some particular thing. For the nuptial \nsolemnization takes place only when the marriage is celebrated, and when \nthe bride and bridegroom mutually deliver the power over their bodies to \none another. In like manner a vow is solemnized when a man devotes \nhimself to the divine ministry by receiving holy orders, or embraces the \nstate of perfection by renouncing the world and his own will by the \nprofession of a certain rule.",

And since, as stated in the \nsame article, the solemnization of a vow consists in a spiritual blessing \nand consecration bestowed through the ministry of the Church, it follows \nthat it comes under the Church's dispensation. Now a simple vow takes its \nefficacy from the deliberation of the mind, whereby one intends to put \noneself under an obligation. That such an obligation be of no force may \nhappen in two ways. First, through defect of reason, as in madmen and \nimbeciles, who cannot bind themselves by vow so long as they remain in a \nstate of madness or imbecility. Secondly, through the maker of a vow \nbeing subject to another's power, as stated above (Article [8]). Now these two \ncircumstances concur in children before the age of puberty, because in \nmost instances they are lacking in reason, and  besides are naturally \nunder the care of their parents, or guardians in place of their parents: \nwherefore in both events their vows are without force. It happens, \nhowever, through a natural disposition which is not subject to human \nlaws, that the use of reason is accelerated in some, albeit few, who on \nthis account are said to be capable of guile: and yet they are not, for \nthis reason, exempt in any way from the care of their parents; for this \ncare is subject to human law, which takes into account that which is of \nmost frequent occurrence.\nAccordingly we must say that boys or girls who have not reached the \nyears of puberty and have not attained the use of reason can nowise bind \nthemselves to anything by vow. If, however, they attain the use of \nreason, before reaching the years of puberty, they can for their own \npart, bind themselves by vow; but their vows can be annulled by their \nparents, under whose care they are still subject.\nYet no matter how much they be capable of guile before the years of \npuberty, they cannot be bound by a solemn religious vow, on account of \nthe Church's decree [*Sext.

        "ANS": "Three things may be considered in a solemn vow of \ncontinency: first, the matter of the vow, namely, continency; secondly, \nthe perpetuity of the vow, namely, when a person binds himself by vow to \nthe perpetual observance of chastity: thirdly, the solemnity of the vow. \nAccordingly, some [*William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III. vii. 1, qu. 5] say \nthat the solemn vow cannot be a matter of dispensation, on account of the \ncontinency itself for which no worthy price can be found, as is stated by \nthe authority quoted above. The reason for this is assigned by some to \nthe fact that by continency man overcomes a foe within himself, or to the \nfact that by continency man is perfectly conformed to Christ in respect \nof purity of both body and soul. But this reason does not seem to be \ncogent since the goods of the soul, such as contemplation and prayer, far \nsurpass the goods of the body and still more conform us to God, and yet \none may be dispensed from a vow of prayer or contemplation. Therefore, \ncontinency itself absolutely considered seems no reason why the solemn \nvow thereof cannot be a matter of dispensation; especially seeing that \nthe Apostle (1 Cor. 7:34) exhorts us to be continent on account of \ncontemplation, when he says that the unmarried woman . . . \"thinketh on \nthe things of God [Vulg.: 'the Lord'],\" and since the end is of more \naccount than the means.\nConsequently others [*Albertus Magnus, Sent. iv, D, 38] find the reason \nfor this in the perpetuity and universality of this vow. For they assert \nthat the vow of continency cannot be canceled, save by something \naltogether contrary thereto, which is never lawful in any vow. But this \nis evidently false, because just as the practice of carnal intercourse is \ncontrary to continency, so is eating flesh or drinking wine contrary to \nabstinence from such things, and yet these latter vows may be a matter \nfor dispensation.\nFor this reason others [*Innocent IV, on the above decretal] maintain \nthat one may be dispensed even from a solemn vow of continency, for the \nsake of some common good or common need, as in the case of the example \ngiven above (Objection [1]), of a country being restored to peace through a \ncertain marriage to be contracted. Yet since the Decretal quoted says \nexplicitly that \"not even the Sovereign Pontiff can dispense a monk from \nkeeping chastity,\" it follows seemingly, that we must maintain that, as \nstated above (Article [10], ad 1; cf. Lev. 27:9,10,28), whatsoever has once been \nsanctified to the Lord cannot be put to any other use. For no  \necclesiastical prelate can make that which is sanctified to lose its \nconsecration, not even though it be something inanimate, for instance a \nconsecrated chalice to be not consecrated, so long as it remains entire. \nMuch less, therefore, can a prelate make a man that is consecrated to God \ncease to be consecrated, so long as he lives. Now the solemnity of a vow \nconsists in a kind of consecration or blessing of the person who takes \nthe vow, as stated above (Article [7]). Hence no prelate of the Church can make \na man, who has pronounced a solemn vow, to be quit of that to which he \nwas consecrated, e.g. one who is a priest, to be a priest no more, \nalthough a prelate may, for some particular reason, inhibit him from \nexercising his order. In like manner the Pope cannot make a man who has \nmade his religious profession cease to be a religious, although certain \njurists have ignorantly held the contrary.\nWe must therefore consider whether continency is essentially bound up \nwith the purpose for which the vow is solemnized. because if not, the \nsolemnity of the consecration can remain without the obligation of \ncontinency, but not if continency is essentially bound up with that for \nwhich the vow is solemnized. Now the obligation of observing continency \nis connected with Holy orders, not essentially but by the institution of \nthe Church; wherefore it seems that the Church can grant a dispensation \nfrom the vow of continency solemnized by the reception of Holy Orders. on \nthe other hand the obligation of observing; continency is an essential \ncondition of the religious state, whereby a man renounces the world and \nbinds himself wholly to God's service, for this is incompatible with \nmatrimony, in which state a man is under the obligation of taking to \nhimself a wife, of begetting children, of looking after his household, \nand of procuring whatever is necessary for these purposes. Wherefore the \nApostle says (1 Cor. 7:33) that \"he that is with a wife, is solicitous \nfor the things of the world, how he may please his wife; and he is \ndivided.\" Hence the \"monk\" takes his name from \"unity\" [*The Greek \n{monos}] in contrast with this division. For this reason the Church \ncannot dispense from a vow solemnized by the religious profession; and \nthe reason assigned by the Decretal is because \"chastity is bound up with \nthe monastic rule.\"",

Likewise, when anyone rightly \ndetermines of his own authority that in his case a vow is not to be kept, \nhe would seem not to be bound; since a vow need not be kept if it have an \nevil result (Article [2], ad 2).

Now if you promise something to anyone \nit depends on his decision whether he accept what you promise. Again in \nthe Church a prelate stands in God's place. Therefore a commutation or \ndispensation of vows requires the authority of a prelate who in God's \nstead declares what is acceptable to God, according to 2 Cor. 2:10: \"For \n. . . have pardoned . . . for your sakes . . . in the person of Christ.\" \nAnd he says significantly \"for your sakes,\" since whenever we ask a \nprelate for a dispensation we should do so to honor Christ in Whose \nperson he dispenses, or to promote the interests of the Church which is \nHis Body.",

Now \nthe particular is included in the universal, wherefore a Decretal [*Cap. \nScripturae, de Voto et Voti redempt.] says that \"a man is not deemed a \nvow-breaker if he exchange a temporal service for the perpetual service \nof religion.\" And yet a man who enters religion is not bound to fulfil \nthe vows, whether of fasting or of praying or the like, which he made \nwhen in the world, because by entering religion he dies to his former \nlife, and it is unsuitable to the religious life that each one should \nhave his own observances, and because the burden of religion is onerous \nenough without requiring the addition of other burdens.",
        "RP2": "Some have held that prelates can dispense from vows at \ntheir will, for the reason that every vow supposes as a condition that \nthe superior prelate be willing; thus it was stated above (Article [8]) that the \nvow of a subject, e.g. of a slave or a son, supposes this condition, if \n\"the father or master consent,\" or \"does not dissent.\" And thus a subject \nmight break his vow without any remorse of conscience, whenever his \nsuperior tells him to.\nBut this opinion is based on a false supposition: because a spiritual \nprelate being, not a master, but a dispenser, his power is given \"unto \nedification, not for destruction\" (2 Cor. 10:8), and consequently, just \nas he cannot command that which is in itself displeasing to God, namely, \nsin, so neither can he forbid what is in itself pleasing to God, namely, \nworks of virtue. Therefore absolutely speaking man can vow them. But it \ndoes belong to a prelate to decide what is the more virtuous and the more \nacceptable to God. Consequently in matters presenting no difficulty, the \nprelate's dispensation would not excuse one from sin: for instance, if a \nprelate were to dispense a person from a vow to enter the religious life, \nwithout any apparent cause to prevent him from  fulfilling his vow. But \nif some cause were to appear, giving rise, at least, to doubt, he could \nhold to the prelate's decision whether of commutation or of dispensation. \nHe could not, however, follow his own judgment in the matter, because he \ndoes not stand in the place of God; except perhaps in the case when the \nthing he has vowed is clearly unlawful, and he is unable to have recourse \nto the prelate.",
        "RP3": "Since the Sovereign Pontiff holds the place of Christ \nthroughout the whole Church, he exercises absolute power of dispensing \nfrom all vows that admit of dispensation. To other and inferior prelates \nis the power committed of dispensing from those vows that are commonly \nmade and frequently require dispensation, in order that men may easily \nhave recourse to someone; such are the vows of pilgrimage (Cap. de \nPeregin., de Voto et Voti redempt.), fasting and the like, and of \npilgrimage to the Holy Land, are reserved to the Sovereign Pontiff [*Cap. \nEx multa]."

Now speculative propositions receive \nconfirmation from reason, which proceeds from principles known naturally \nand infallibly true. But particular contingent facts regarding man cannot \nbe confirmed by a necessary reason, wherefore propositions regarding such \nthings are wont to be confirmed by witnesses. Now a human witness does \nnot suffice to confirm such matters for two reasons. First, on account of \nman's lack of truth, for many give way to lying, according to Ps. 16:10, \n\"Their mouth hath spoken lies [Vulg.: 'proudly'].\" Secondly, on account \nof this lack of knowledge, since he can know neither the future, nor \nsecret thoughts, nor distant things: and yet men speak about such things, \nand our everyday life requires that we should have some certitude about \nthem. Hence the need to have recourse to a Divine witness, for neither \ncan God lie, nor is anything hidden from Him. Now to call God to witness \nis named \"jurare\" [to swear] because it is established as though it were \na principle of law [jure] that what a man asserts under the invocation of \nGod as His witness should be accepted as true. Now sometimes God is \ncalled to witness when we assert present or past events, and this is \ntermed a \"declaratory oath\"; while sometimes God is called to witness in \nconfirmation of something future, and this is termed a \"promissory oath.\" \nBut oaths are not employed in order to substantiate necessary matters, \nand such as come under the investigation of reason; for it would seem \nabsurd in a scientific discussion to wish to prove one's point by an oath.",

For if a man \ncalls God as witness, for some trifling reason, it would seemingly prove \nhim to have but little reverence for God, since he would not treat even a \ngood man in this manner.

Yet there is a difference: \nsince, in the oath that is about the past or present, this obligation \naffects, not the thing that already has been or is, but the action of the \nswearer, in the point of his swearing to what is or was already true; \nwhereas, on the contrary, in the oath that is made about something to be \ndone by us, the obligation falls on the thing guaranteed by oath. For a \nman is bound to make true what he has sworn, else his oath lacks truth.\nNow if this thing be such as not to be in his power, his oath is lacking \nin judgment of discretion: unless perchance what was possible when he \nswore become impossible to him through some mishap. as when a man swore \nto pay a sum of money, which is subsequently taken from him by force or \ntheft. For then he would seem to be excused from fulfilling his oath, \nalthough he is bound to do what he can, as, in fact, we have already \nstated with regard to the obligation of a vow (Question [88], Article [3], ad 2). If, on \nthe other hand, it be something that he can do, but ought not to, either \nbecause it is essentially evil, or because it is a hindrance to a good, \nthen his oath is lacking in justice: wherefore an oath must not be kept \nwhen it involves a sin or a hindrance to good. For in either case \"its \nresult is evil\" [*Cf. Bede, Homil. xix, in Decoll. S. Joan. Bapt.]\nAccordingly we must conclude that whoever swears to do something is \nbound to do what he can for the fulfilment of truth; provided always that \nthe other two accompanying conditions be present, namely, judgment and \njustice.",
        "RP1": "It is not the same with a simple assertion, and with an \noath wherein God is called to witness: because it suffices for the truth \nof an assertion, that a person say what he proposes to do, since it is \nalready true in its cause, namely, the purpose of the doer. But an oath \nshould not be employed, save in a matter about which one is firmly \ncertain: and, consequently, if a man employ an oath, he is bound, as far \nas he can, to make true what he has sworn, through reverence of the \nDivine witness invoked, unless it leads to an evil result, as stated.",
        "RP2": "An oath may lead to an evil result in two ways. First, \nbecause from the very outset it has an evil result, either through being \nevil of its very nature (as, if a man were to swear to commit adultery), \nor through being a hindrance to a greater good, as if a man were to swear \nnot to enter religion, or not to become a cleric, or that he would not \naccept a prelacy, supposing it would be expedient for him to accept, or \nin similar cases. For oaths of this kind are unlawful from the outset: \nyet with a  difference: because if a man swear to commit a sin, he sinned \nin swearing, and sins in keeping his oath: whereas if a man swear not to \nperform a greater good, which he is not bound to do withal, he sins \nindeed in swearing (through placing an obstacle to the Holy Ghost, Who is \nthe inspirer of good purposes), yet he does not sin in keeping his oath, \nthough he does much better if he does not keep it.\nSecondly, an oath leads to an evil result through some new and \nunforeseen emergency. An instance is the oath of Herod, who swore to the \ndamsel, who danced before him, that he would give her what she would ask \nof him. For this oath could be lawful from the outset, supposing it to \nhave the requisite conditions, namely, that the damsel asked what it was \nright to grant. but the fulfilment of the oath was unlawful. Hence \nAmbrose says (De Officiis i, 50): \"Sometimes it is wrong to fulfil a \npromise, and to keep an oath; as Herod, who granted the slaying of John, \nrather than refuse what he had promised.\"",
        "RP3": "There is a twofold obligation in the oath which a man takes \nunder compulsion: one, whereby he is beholden to the person to whom he \npromises something; and this obligation is cancelled by the compulsion, \nbecause he that used force deserves that the promise made to him should \nnot be kept. The other is an obligation whereby a man is beholden to God, \nin virtue of which he is bound to fulfil what he has promised in His \nname. This obligation is not removed in the tribunal of conscience, \nbecause that man ought rather to suffer temporal loss, than violate his \noath. He can, however, seek in a court of justice to recover what he has \npaid, or denounce the matter to his superior even if he has sworn to the \ncontrary, because such an oath would lead to evil results since it would \nbe contrary to public justice. The Roman Pontiffs, in absolving men from \noaths of this kind, did not pronounce such oaths to be unbinding, but \nrelaxed the obligation for some just cause.",
        "RP4": "When the intention of the swearer is not the same as the \nintention of the person to whom he swears, if this be due to the \nswearer's guile, he must keep his oath in accordance with the sound \nunderstanding of the person to whom the oath is made. Hence Isidore says \n(De Summo Bono ii, 31): \"However artful a man may be in wording his oath, \nGod Who witnesses his conscience accepts his oath as understood by the \nperson to whom it is made.\" And that this refers to the deceitful oath is \nclear from what follows: \"He is doubly guilty who both takes God's name \nin vain, and tricks his neighbor by guile.\" If, however, the swearer uses \nno guile, he is bound in accordance with his own intention. Wherefore \nGregory says (Moral. xxvi, 7): \"The human ear takes such like words in \ntheir natural outward sense, but the Divine judgment interprets them \naccording to our inward intention.\""

Now the matter of a \ndeclaratory oath, which is about something past or present, has already \nacquired a certain necessity, and has become unchangeable, wherefore the \ndispensation will regard not the matter but the act itself of the oath: \nso that such a dispensation would be directly contrary to the Divine \nprecept. On the other hand, the matter of a promissory oath is something \nfuture, which admits of change, so that, to wit, in certain emergencies, \nit may be unlawful or hurtful, and consequently undue matter for an oath. \nTherefore a promissory oath admits of dispensation, since such \ndispensation regards the matter of an oath, and is not contrary to the \nDivine precept about the keeping of oaths.",

First, when he promises something for his benefit: for instance, if \nhe promise to serve him, or to give him money: and from such a promise he \ncan be released by the person to whom he made it: for he is understood to \nhave already kept his promise to him when he acts towards him according \nto his will. Secondly, one man promises another something pertaining to \nGod's  honor or to the benefit of others: for instance, if a man promise \nanother under oath that he will enter religion, or perform some act of \nkindness. In this case the person to whom the promise is made cannot \nrelease him that made the promise, because it was made principally not to \nhim but to God: unless perchance it included some condition, for \ninstance, \"provided he give his consent\" or some such like condition.",

But in the former case a man is bound not \nto keep such an oath, while in the latter it is lawful for him to keep or \nnot to keep the oath, as stated above (Article [7], ad 2). Sometimes what is \npromised on oath is doubtfully right or wrong, useful or harmful, either \nin itself or under the circumstance. In this case any bishop can \ndispense. Sometimes, however, that which is promised under oath is \nmanifestly lawful and beneficial. An oath of this kind seemingly admits \nnot of dispensation but of commutation, when there occurs something \nbetter to be done for the common good, in which case the matter would \nseem to belong chiefly to the power of the Pope, who has charge over the \nwhole Church; and even of absolute relaxation, for this too belongs in \ngeneral to the Pope in all matters regarding the administration of things \necclesiastical. Thus it is competent to any man to cancel an oath made by \none of his subjects in matters that come under his authority: for \ninstance, a father may annul his daughter's oath, and a husband his \nwife's (Num. 30:6, seqq.), as stated above with regard to vows (Question [88], Articles [8],9)."

Hence they thought that divine worship ought to be given to the \nwhole world and to all its parts, heaven, air, water, and to all such \nthings: and to these they referred the names of their gods, as Varro \nasserted, and Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei vii, 5). Lastly, others, \nnamely, the Platonists, said that there is one supreme god, the cause of \nall things. After him they placed certain spiritual substances created by \nthe supreme god. These they called \"gods,\" on account of their having a \nshare of the godhead; but we call them \"angels.\" After these they placed \nthe souls of the heavenly bodies, and beneath these the demons which they \nstated to be certain animal denizens of the air, and beneath these again \nthey placed human souls, which they believed to be taken up into the \nfellowship of the gods or of the demons by reason of the merit of their \nvirtue. To all these they gave divine worship, as Augustine relates (De \nCiv . . Dei xviii, 14).\nThe last two opinions were held to belong to \"natural theology\" which \nthe philosophers gathered from their study of the world and taught in the \nschools: while the other, relating to the worship of men, was said to \nbelong to \"mythical theology\" which was wont to be represented on the \nstage according to the fancies of poets. The remaining opinion relating \nto images was held to belong to \"civil theology,\" which was celebrated by \nthe pontiffs in the temples [*De Civ. Dei vi, 5].\nNow all these come under the head of the superstition of idolatry. \nWherefore Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20): \"Anything invented \nby man for making and worshipping idols, or for giving Divine worship to \na creature or any part of a creature, is superstitious.\"",

In one sense it \nmay denote a human act pertaining to the worship of God: and then its \nsignification remains the same, to whomsoever it be shown, because, in \nthis sense, the thing to which it is shown is  not included in its \ndefinition. Taken thus latria is applied univocally, whether to true \nreligion or to idolatry, just as the payment of a tax is univocally the \nsame, whether it is paid to the true or to a false king. In another sense \nlatria denotes the same as religion, and then, since it is a virtue, it \nis essential thereto that divine worship be given to whom it ought to be \ngiven; and in this way latria is applied equivocally to the latria of \ntrue religion, and to idolatry: just as prudence is applied equivocally \nto the prudence that is a virtue, and to that which is carnal.",

        "ANS": "There has been a twofold error in this matter.  For some \n[*The School of Plato] have thought that to offer sacrifices and other \nthings pertaining to latria, not only to God but also to the others \naforesaid, is due and good in itself, since they held that divine honor \nshould be paid to every superior nature, as being nearer to God. But this \nis unreasonable. For though we ought to revere all superiors, yet the \nsame reverence is not due to them all: and something special is due to \nthe most high God Who excels all in a singular manner: and this is the \nworship of latria.\nNor can it be said, as some have maintained, that \"these visible \nsacrifices are fitting with regard to other gods, and that to the most \nhigh God, as being better than those others, better sacrifices, namely, \nthe service of a pure mind, should be offered\" [*Augustine, as quoted \nbelow]. The reason is that, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 19), \n\"external sacrifices are signs of internal, just as audible words are \nsigns of things. Wherefore, just as by prayer and praise we utter \nsignificant words to Him, and offer to Him in our hearts the things they \nsignify, so too in our sacrifices we ought to realize that we should \noffer a visible sacrifice to no other than to Him Whose invisible \nsacrifice we ourselves should be in our hearts.\"\nOthers held that the outward worship of latria should be given to idols, \nnot as though it were something good or fitting in itself, but as being \nin harmony with the general custom. Thus Augustine (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) \nquotes Seneca as saying: \"We shall adore,\" says he, \"in such a way as to \nremember that our worship ss in accordance with custom rather than with \nthe reality\": and (De Vera Relig. v) Augustine says that \"we must not \nseek religion from the philosophers, who accepted the same things for \nsacred, as did the people; and gave utterance in the schools to various \nand contrary opinions about the nature of their gods, and the sovereign \ngood.\" This error was embraced also by certain heretics [*The \nHelcesaitae], who affirmed that it is not wrong for one who is seized in \ntime of persecution to worship idols outwardly so long as he keeps the \nfaith in his heart.\nBut this is evidently false. For since outward worship is a sign of the \ninward worship, just as it is a wicked lie to affirm the contrary of what \none holds inwardly of the true faith so too is it a wicked falsehood to \npay outward worship to anything counter to the sentiments of one's heart. \nWherefore Augustine condemns Seneca (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) in that \"his \nworship of idols was so much the more infamous forasmuch as the things he \ndid dishonestly were so done by him that the people believed him to act \nhonestly.\"",
        "RP1": "Neither in the Tabernacle or Temple of the Old Law, nor \nagain now in the Church are images set up that the worship of latria may \nbe paid to them, but for the purpose of signification, in order that \nbelief in the excellence of angels and saints may be impressed and \nconfirmed in the mind of man.

Other causes produce their \neffects, not of necessity and always, but for the most part, yet they \nrarely fail: and from such like causes their future effects can be \nforeknown, not indeed with certainty, but by a kind of conjecture, even \nas astrologers by considering the stars can foreknow and foretell things \nconcerning rains and droughts, and physicians, concerning health and \ndeath. Again, other causes, considered in themselves, are indifferent; \nand this is chiefly the case in the rational powers, which stand in \nrelation to opposites, according to the Philosopher [*Metaph. viii, \n2,5,8].

If these signs appear in some earthly body such as wood, iron or \npolished stone, it is called \"geomancy,\" if in water \"hydromancy,\" if in \nthe air \"aeromancy,\" if in fire \"pyromancy,\" if in the entrails of \nanimals sacrificed on the altars of demons, \"aruspicy.\"\nThe divination which is practiced without express invocation of the \ndemons is of two kinds. The first is when, with a view to obtain \nknowledge of the future, we take observations in the disposition of \ncertain things. If one endeavor to know the future by observing the \nposition and movements of the stars, this belongs to \"astrologers,\" who \nare also called \"genethliacs,\" because they take note of the days on \nwhich people are born. If one observe the movements and cries of birds or \nof any animals, or the sneezing of men, or the sudden movements of limbs, \nthis belongs in general to \"augury,\" which is so called from the \nchattering of birds [avium garritu], just as \"auspice\" is derived from \nwatching birds [avium inspectione]. These are chiefly wont to be observed \nin birds, the former by the ear, the latter by the eye. If, however, \nthese observations have for their object men's words uttered \nunintentionally, which someone twist so as to apply to the future that he \nwishes to foreknow, then it is called an \"omen\": and as Valerius Maximus \n[*De Dict. Fact. Memor. i, 5] remarks, \"the observing of omens has a \ntouch of religion mingled with it, for it is believed to be founded not \non a chance movement, but on divine providence. It was thus that when the \nRomans were deliberating whether they would change their position, a \ncenturion happened to  exclaim at the time: 'Standard-bearer, fix the \nbanner, we had best stand here': and on hearing these words they took \nthem as an omen, and abandoned their intention of advancing further.\" If, \nhowever, the observation regards the dispositions, that occur to the eye, \nof figures in certain bodies, there will be another species of \ndivination: for the divination that is taken from observing the lines of \nthe hand is called \"chiromancy,\" i.e. divination of the hand (because \n{cheir} is the Greek for hand): while the divination which is taken from \nsigns appearing in the shoulder-blades of an animal is called \n\"spatulamancy.\"\nTo this second species of divination, which is without express \ninvocation of the demons, belongs that which is practiced by observing \ncertain things done seriously by men in the research of the occult, \nwhether by drawing lots, which is called \"geomancy\"; or by observing the \nshapes resulting from molten lead poured into water; or by observing \nwhich of several sheets of paper, with or without writing upon them, a \nperson may happen to draw; or by holding out several unequal sticks and \nnoting who takes the greater or the lesser. or by throwing dice, and \nobserving who throws the highest score; or by observing what catches the \neye when one opens a book, all of which are named \"sortilege.\"\nAccordingly it is clear that there are three kinds of divination. The \nfirst is when the demons are invoked openly, this comes under the head of \n\"necromancy\"; the second is merely an observation of the disposition or \nmovement of some other being, and this belongs to \"augury\"; while the \nthird consists in doing something in order to discover the occult; and \nthis belongs to \"sortilege.\" Under each of these many others are \ncontained, as explained above.",
        "RP1": "In all the aforesaid there is the same general, but not the \nsame special, character of sin: for it is much more grievous to invoke \nthe demons than to do things that deserve the demons' interference.",

The second reason is gathered from the result. For the demon who \nintends man's perdition endeavors, by his answers, even though he \nsometimes tells the truth, to accustom men to believe him, and so to lead \nhim on to something prejudicial to the salvation of mankind. Hence \nAthanasius, commenting on the words of Lk. 4:35, \"He rebuked him, saying: \nHold thy peace,\" says: \"Although the demon confessed the truth, Christ \nput a stop to his speech, lest together with the truth he should publish \nhis wickedness and accustom us to care little for such things, however \nmuch he may seem to speak the truth. For it is wicked, while we have the \ndivine Scriptures, to seek knowledge from the demons.\"",

        "CON": "Augustine says (Confess. iv, 3): \"Those astrologers \nwhom they call mathematicians, I consulted without scruple; because they \nseemed to use no sacrifice, nor to pray to any spirit for their \ndivinations which art, however, Christian and true piety rejects and \ncondemns.\"",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Articles [1],2), the operation of the demon \nthrusts itself into those divinations which are based on false and vain \nopinions, in order that man's mind may become entangled in vanity and \nfalsehood. Now one makes use of a vain and false opinion if, by observing \nthe stars, one desires to foreknow the future that cannot be forecast by \ntheir means. Wherefore we must consider what things can be foreknown by \nobserving the stars: and it is evident that those things which happen of \nnecessity can be foreknown by this mean,: even so astrologers forecast a \nfuture eclipse.\nHowever, with regard to the foreknowledge of future events acquired by \nobserving the stars there have been various opinions.  For some have \nstated that the stars signify rather than cause the things foretold by \nmeans of their observation. But this is an unreasonable statement: since \nevery corporeal sign is either the effect of that for which it stands \n(thus smoke signifies fire whereby it is caused), or it proceeds from the \nsame cause, so that by signifying the cause, in consequence it signifies \nthe effect (thus a rainbow is sometimes a sign of fair weather, in so far \nas its cause is the cause of fair weather). Now it cannot be said that \nthe dispositions and movements of the heavenly bodies are the effect of \nfuture events; nor again can they be ascribed to some common higher cause \nof a corporeal nature, although they are referable to a common higher \ncause, which is divine providence. on the contrary the appointment of the \nmovements and positions of the heavenly bodies by divine providence is on \na different principle from the appointment of the occurrence of future \ncontingencies, because the former are appointed on a principle of \nnecessity, so that they always occur in the same way, whereas the latter \nare appointed on a principle of contingency, so that the manner of their \noccurrence is variable. Consequently it is impossible to acquire \nforeknowledge of the future from an observation of the stars, except in \nso far as effects can be foreknown from their causes.\nNow two kinds of effects escape the causality of heavenly bodies. In the \nfirst place all effects that occur accidentally, whether in human affairs \nor in the natural order, since, as it is proved in Metaph. vi [*Ed. Did. \nv, 3], an accidental being has no cause, least of all a natural cause, \nsuch as is the power of a heavenly body, because what occurs \naccidentally, neither is a \"being\" properly speaking, nor is \"one\"---for \ninstance, that an earthquake occur when a stone falls, or that a treasure \nbe discovered when a man digs a grave---for these and like occurrences \nare not one thing, but are simply several things. Whereas the operation \nof nature has always some one thing for its term, just as it proceeds \nfrom some one principle, which is the form of a natural thing.\nIn the second place, acts of the free-will, which is the faculty of will \nand reason, escape the causality of heavenly bodies. For the intellect or \nreason is not a body, nor the act of a bodily organ, and consequently \nneither is the will, since it is in the reason, as the Philosopher shows \n(De Anima iii, 4,9). Now no body can make an impression on an incorporeal \nbody. Wherefore it is impossible for heavenly bodies to make a direct \nimpression on the intellect and will: for this would be to deny the \ndifference between intellect and sense, with which position Aristotle \nreproaches (De Anima iii, 3) those who held that \"such is the will of \nman, as is the day which the father of men and of gods,\" i.e. the sun or \nthe heavens, \"brings on\" [*Odyssey xviii, 135].\nHence the heavenly bodies cannot be the direct cause of the free-will's \noperations. Nevertheless they can be a dispositive cause of an \ninclination to those operations, in so far as they make an impression on \nthe human body, and consequently on the sensitive  powers which are acts \nof bodily organs having an inclination for human acts. Since, however, \nthe sensitive powers obey reason, as the Philosopher shows (De Anima iii, \n11; Ethic. i, 13), this does not impose any necessity on the free-will, \nand man is able, by his reason, to act counter to the inclination of the \nheavenly bodies.\nAccordingly if anyone take observation of the stars in order to foreknow \ncasual or fortuitous future events, or to know with certitude future \nhuman actions, his conduct is based on a false and vain opinion; and so \nthe operation of the demon introduces itself therein, wherefore it will \nbe a superstitious and unlawful divination. On the other hand if one were \nto apply the observation of the stars in order to foreknow those future \nthings that are caused by heavenly bodies, for instance, drought or rain \nand so forth, it will be neither an unlawful nor a superstitious \ndivination.\nWherefore the Reply to the First Objection is evident.",
        "RP2": "That astrologers not unfrequently forecast the truth by \nobserving the stars may be explained in two ways. First, because a great \nnumber of men follow their bodily passions, so that their actions are for \nthe most part disposed in accordance with the inclination of the heavenly \nbodies: while there are few, namely, the wise alone, who moderate these \ninclinations by their reason. The result is that astrologers in many \ncases foretell the truth, especially in public occurrences which depend \non the multitude. Secondly, because of the interference of the demons. \nHence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 17): \"When astrologers tell the \ntruth, it must be allowed that this is due to an instinct that, unknown \nto man, lies hidden in his mind. And since this happens through the \naction of unclean and lying spirits who desire to deceive man for they \nare permitted to know certain things about temporal affairs.\" Wherefore \nhe concludes: \"Thus a good Christian should beware of astrologers, and of \nall impious diviners, especially of those who tell the truth, lest his \nsoul become the dupe of the demons and by making a compact of partnership \nwith them enmesh itself in their fellowship.\"\nThis suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection."

        "ANS": "As stated above (Articles [2],6), divination is superstitious \nand unlawful when it is based on a false opinion. Wherefore we must \nconsider what is true in the matter of foreknowing the future from \ndreams. Now dreams are sometimes the cause of future occurrences; for \ninstance, when a person's mind becomes anxious through what it has seen \nin a dream and is thereby led to do something or avoid something: while \nsometimes dreams are signs of future happenings, in so far as they are \nreferable to some common cause of both dreams and future occurrences, and \nin this way the future is frequently known from dreams. We must, then, \nconsider what is the cause of dreams, and whether it can be the cause of \nfuture occurrences, or be cognizant of them.\nAccordingly it is to be observed that the cause of dreams is sometimes \nin us and sometimes outside us. The inward cause of dreams is twofold: \none regards the soul, in so far as those things which have occupied a \nman's thoughts and affections while awake recur to his imagination while \nasleep. A such like cause of dreams is not a cause of future occurrences, \nso that dreams of this kind are related accidentally to future \noccurrences, and if at any time they concur it will be by chance. But \nsometimes the inward cause of dreams regards the body: because the inward \ndisposition of the body leads to the formation of a movement in the \nimagination consistent with that disposition; thus a man in whom there is \nabundance of cold humors dreams that he is in the water or snow: and for \nthis reason physicians say that we should take note of dreams in order to \ndiscover internal dispositions.\nIn like manner the outward cause of dreams is twofold, corporal and \nspiritual. It is corporal in so far as the sleeper's imagination is \naffected either by the surrounding air, or through an impression of a \nheavenly body, so that certain images appear to the sleeper, in keeping \nwith the disposition of the heavenly bodies. The spiritual cause is \nsometimes referable to God, Who reveals certain things to men in their \ndreams by the ministry of the angels, according Num. 12:6, \"If there be \namong you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I \nwill speak to him in a dream.\" Sometimes, however, it is due to the \naction of the demons that certain images appear to persons in their \nsleep, and by  this means they, at times, reveal certain future things to \nthose who have entered into an unlawful compact with them.\nAccordingly we must say that there is no unlawful divination in making \nuse of dreams for the foreknowledge of the future, so long as those \ndreams are due to divine revelation, or to some natural cause inward or \noutward, and so far as the efficacy of that cause extends. But it will be \nan unlawful and superstitious divination if it be caused by a revelation \nof the demons, with whom a compact has been made, whether explicit, \nthrough their being invoked for the purpose, or implicit, through the \ndivination extending beyond its possible limits.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the Objections."

        "ANS": "The movements or cries of birds, and whatever \ndispositions one may consider in such things, are manifestly not the \ncause of future events: wherefore the future cannot be known therefrom as \nfrom its cause. It follows therefore that if anything future can be known \nfrom them, it will be because the causes from which they proceed are also \nthe causes of future occurrences or are cognizant of them. Now the cause \nof dumb animals' actions is a  certain instinct whereby they are inclined \nby a natural movement, for they are not masters of their actions. This \ninstinct may proceed from a twofold cause. In the first place it may be \ndue to a bodily cause. For since dumb animals have naught but a sensitive \nsoul, every power of which is the act of a bodily organ, their soul is \nsubject to the disposition of surrounding bodies, and primarily to that \nof the heavenly bodies. Hence nothing prevents some of their actions from \nbeing signs of the future, in so far as they are conformed to the \ndispositions of the heavenly bodies and of the surrounding air, to which \ncertain future events are due. Yet in this matter we must observe two \nthings: first, that such observations must not be applied to the \nforeknowledge of future things other than those which can be foreknown \nfrom the movements of heavenly bodies, as stated above (Articles [5],6): \nsecondly, that they be not applied to other matters than those which in \nsome way may have reference to these animals (since they acquire through \nthe heavenly bodies a certain natural knowledge and instinct about things \nnecessary for their life---such as changes resulting from rain and wind \nand so forth).\nIn the second place, this instinct is produced by a spiritual cause, \nnamely, either by God, as may be seen in the dove that descended upon \nChrist, the raven that fed Elias, and the whale that swallowed and \nvomited Jonas, or by demons, who make use of these actions of dumb \nanimals in order to entangle our minds with vain opinions. This seems to \nbe true of all such like things; except omens, because human words which \nare taken for an omen are not subject to the disposition of the stars, \nyet are they ordered according to divine providence and sometimes \naccording to the action of the demons.\nAccordingly we must say that all such like divinations are superstitious \nand unlawful, if they be extended beyond the limits set according to the \norder of nature or of divine providence.",

For which reason we wish them \nto be condemned altogether, and henceforth not to be mentioned among \nChristians, and we forbid the practice thereof under pain of anathema.\"",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [3]), sortilege consists, properly \nspeaking, in doing something, that by observing the result one may come \nto the knowledge of something unknown. If by casting lots one seeks to \nknow what is to be given to whom, whether it be a possession, an honor, a \ndignity, a punishment, or some action or other, it is called \"sortilege \nof allotment\"; if one seeks to know what ought to be done, it is called \n\"sortilege of consultation\"; if one seeks to know what is going to \nhappen, it is called \"sortilege of divination.\" Now the actions of man \nthat are required for sortilege and their results are not subject to the \ndispositions of the stars. Wherefore if anyone practicing sortilege is so \nminded as though the human acts requisite for sortilege depended for \ntheir result on the dispositions of the stars, his opinion is vain and \nfalse, and consequently is not free from the interference of the demons, \nso that a divination of this kind is superstitious and unlawful.\nApart from this cause, however, the result of sortilegious acts must \nneeds be ascribed to chance, or to some directing  spiritual cause. If we \nascribe it to chance, and this can only take place in \"sortilege of \nallotment,\" it does not seem to imply any vice other than vanity, as in \nthe case of persons who, being unable to agree upon the division of \nsomething or other, are willing to draw lots for its division, thus \nleaving to chance what portion each is to receive.\nIf, on the other hand, the decision by lot be left to a spiritual cause, \nit is sometimes ascribed to demons. Thus we read (Ezech. 21:21) that \"the \nking of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking \ndivination, shuffling arrows; he inquired of the idols, and consulted \nentrails\": sortilege of this kind is unlawful, and forbidden by the \ncanons.\nSometimes, however, the decision is left to God, according to Prov. \n16:33, \"Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the \nLord\": sortilege of this kind is not wrong in itself, as Augustine \ndeclares [*Enarr. ii in Ps. xxx, serm. 2; cf. Objection [1]].\nYet this may happen to be sinful in four ways. First, if one have \nrecourse to lots without any necessity: for this would seem to amount to \ntempting God. Hence Ambrose, commenting on the words of Lk. 1:8, says: \n\"He that is chosen by lot is not bound by the judgment of men.\" Secondly, \nif even in a case of necessity one were to have recourse to lots without \nreverence. Hence, on the Acts of the Apostles, Bede says (Super Act. \nApost. i): \"But if anyone, compelled by necessity, thinks that he ought, \nafter the apostles' example, to consult God by casting lots, let him take \nnote that the apostles themselves did not do so, except after calling \ntogether the assembly of the brethren and pouring forth prayer to God.\" \nThirdly, if the Divine oracles be misapplied to earthly business. Hence \nAugustine says (ad inquisit. Januar. ii; Ep. lv): \"Those who tell \nfortunes from the Gospel pages, though it is to be hoped that they do so \nrather than have recourse to consulting the demons, yet does this custom \nalso displease me, that anyone should wish to apply the Divine oracles to \nworldly matters and to the vain things of this life.\" Fourthly, if anyone \nresort to the drawing of lots in ecclesiastical elections, which should \nbe carried out by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore, as Bede \nsays (Super Act. Apost. i): \"Before Pentecost the ordination of Matthias \nwas decided by lot,\" because as yet the fulness of the Holy Ghost was not \nyet poured forth into the Church: \"whereas the same deacons were ordained \nnot by lot but by the choice of the disciples.\" It is different with \nearthly honors, which are directed to the disposal of earthly things: in \nelections of this kind men frequently have recourse to lots, even as in \nthe distribution of earthly possessions.\nIf, however, there be urgent necessity it is lawful to seek the divine \njudgment by casting lots, provided due reverence be observed. Hence \nAugustine says (Ep. ad Honor. ccxxviii), \"If, at a time of persecution, \nthe ministers of God do not agree as to which of them is to remain at his \npost lest all should flee, and which of them is to flee, lest all die and \nthe Church be forsaken, should  there be no other means of coming to an \nagreement, so far as I can see, they must be chosen by lot.\" Again he \nsays (De Doctr. Christ. xxviii): \"If thou aboundest in that which it \nbehooves thee to give to him who hath not, and which cannot be given to \ntwo; should two come to you, neither of whom surpasses the other either \nin need or in some claim on thee, thou couldst not act more justly than \nin choosing by lot to whom thou shalt give that which thou canst not give \nto both.\"\nThis suffices for the Reply to the First and Second Objections.",
        "RP3": "The trial by hot iron or boiling water is directed to the \ninvestigation of someone's hidden sin, by means of something done by a \nman, and in this it agrees with the drawing of lots. But in so far as a \nmiraculous result is expected from God, it surpasses the common \ngenerality of sortilege. Hence this kind of trial is rendered unlawful, \nboth because it is directed to the judgment of the occult, which is \nreserved to the divine judgment, and because such like trials are not \nsanctioned by divine authority. Hence we read in a decree of Pope Stephen \nV [*II, qu. v., can. Consuluist i]: \"The sacred canons do not approve of \nextorting a confession from anyone by means of the trial by hot iron or \nboiling water, and no one must presume, by a superstitious innovation, to \npractice what is not sanctioned by the teaching of the holy fathers. For \nit is allowable that public crimes should be judged by our authority, \nafter the culprit has made spontaneous confession, or when witnesses have \nbeen approved, with due regard to the fear of God; but hidden and unknown \ncrimes must be left to Him Who alone knows the hearts of the children of \nmen.\" The same would seem to apply to the law concerning duels, save that \nit approaches nearer to the common kind of sortilege, since no miraculous \neffect is expected thereupon, unless the combatants be very unequal in \nstrength or skill."

Now the observances  of the magic art are not evil as \nto the genus of the deed, for they consist in certain fasts and prayers \nto God; moreover, they are directed to a good end, namely, the \nacquisition of science. Therefore it is not unlawful to practice these \nobservances.",

It follows, therefore, that they are empty signs, and consequently \na kind of \"agreement or covenant made with the demons for the purpose of \nconsultation and of compact by tokens\" [*Augustine, De Doctr.

Wherefore the magic art is to be absolutely \nrepudiated and avoided by Christian, even as other arts of vain and \nnoxious superstition, as Augustine declares (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 23). \nThis art is also useless for the acquisition of science. For since it is \nnot intended by means of this art to acquire science in a manner \nconnatural to man, namely, by discovery and instruction, the consequence \nis that this effect is expected either from God or from the demons. Now \nit is certain that some have received wisdom and science infused into \nthem by God, as related of Solomon (3 Kgs. 3 and 2 Paralip 1). Moreover, \nour Lord said to His disciples (Lk. 21:15): \"I will give you a mouth and \nwisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and \ngainsay.\" However, this gift is not granted to all, or in connection with \nany particular  observance, but according to the will of the Holy Ghost, \nas stated in 1 Cor. 12:8, \"To one indeed by the Spirit is given the word \nof wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, according to the same \nSpirit,\" and afterwards it is said (1 Cor. 12:11): \"All these things one \nand the same Spirit worketh, dividing to everyone according as He will.\" \nOn the other hand it does not belong to the demons to enlighten the \nintellect, as stated in the FP, Question [109], Article [3]. Now the acquisition of \nknowledge and wisdom is effected by the enlightening of the intellect, \nwherefore never did anyone acquire knowledge by means of the demons. \nHence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 9): \"Porphyry confesses that the \nintellectual soul is in no way cleansed by theurgic inventions,\" i.e. the \noperations \"of the demons, so as to be fitted to see its God, and discern \nwhat is true,\" such as are all scientific conclusions.

By words, \nthat we may find out whether he knows what we ask, or whether he can and \nwill grant it: by deeds, when, by what we do, we probe another's \nprudence, will or power. Either of these may happen in two ways. First, \nopenly, as when one declares oneself a tempter: thus Samson (Judges \n14:12) proposed a riddle to the Philistines in order to tempt them. In \nthe second place it may be done with cunning and by stealth, as the \nPharisees tempted Christ, as we read in Mt. 22:15, sqq. Again this is \nsometimes done explicitly, as when anyone intends, by word or deed, to \nput some person to the test; and sometimes implicitly, when, to wit, \nthough he does not intend to test a person, yet that which he does or \nsays  can seemingly have no other purpose than putting him to a test.\nAccordingly, man tempts God sometimes by words, sometimes by deeds. Now \nwe speak with God in words when we pray. Hence a man tempts God \nexplicitly in his prayers when he asks something of God with the \nintention of probing God's knowledge, power or will. He tempts God \nexplicitly by deeds when he intends, by whatever he does, to experiment \non God's power, good will or wisdom. But He will tempt God implicitly, \nif, though he does not intend to make an experiment on God, yet he asks \nfor or does something which has no other use than to prove God's power, \ngoodness or knowledge. Thus when a man wishes his horse to gallop in \norder to escape from the enemy, this is not giving the horse a trial: but \nif he make the horse gallop with out any useful purpose, it seems to be \nnothing else than a trial of the horse's speed; and the same applies to \nall other things. Accordingly when a man in his prayers or deeds entrusts \nhimself to the divine assistance for some urgent or useful motive, this \nis not to tempt God: for it is written (2 Paralip 20:12): \"As we know not \nwhat to do, we can only turn our eyes to Thee.\" But if this be done \nwithout any useful or urgent motive, this is to tempt God implicitly. \nWherefore a gloss on Dt. 6:16, \"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,\" \nsays: \"A man tempts God, if having the means at hand, without reason he \nchooses a dangerous course, trying whether he can be delivered by God.\"",

Yet it is simoniacal to do such things by contract, or with the \nintention of buying or selling. Hence it would be an unlawful ordinance \nif it were decreed in any church that no procession would take place at a \nfuneral unless a certain sum of money were paid, because such an \nordinance would preclude the free granting of pious offices to any \nperson.

On the other hand, for the son to bestow something on his father is \naccidental, arising from some momentary necessity, wherein he is bound to \nsupport him, but not to lay by as for a long time beforehand, because \nnaturally parents are not the successors of their children, but children \nof their parents.",

Now, \nas stated above (FS, Question [7], Article [2]; FS, Question [18], Article [3]), the act of every \nvirtue is limited by the circumstances due thereto, and if it overstep \nthem it will be an act no longer of virtue but of vice. Hence it belongs \nto piety to pay duty and homage to one's parents according to the due \nmode. But it is not the due mode that man should tend to worship his \nfather rather than God, but, as Ambrose says on Lk. 12:52, \"the piety of \ndivine religion takes precedence of the claims of kindred.\"\nAccordingly, if the worship of one's parents take one away from the \nworship of God it would no longer be an act of piety to pay worship to \none's parents to the prejudice of God. Hence Jerome says (Ep. ad \nHeliod.): \"Though thou trample upon thy father, though thou spurn thy \nmother, turn not aside, but with dry eyes hasten to the standard of the \ncross; it is the highest degree of piety to be cruel in this matter.\" \nTherefore in such a case the duties of piety towards one's parents should \nbe omitted for the sake of the worship religion gives to God.

Therefore \nthe commands of a superior must be esteemed the commands of God, \nwherefore the Apostle says (Gal. 4:14): \"You . . . received me as an \nangel of God, even as Christ Jesus\" and (1 Thess. 2:13): \"When you had \nreceived of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it, not as \nthe word of men, but, as it is indeed, the word of God.\" Therefore as man \nis bound to obey God in all things, so is he bound to obey his superiors.",

That a natural thing be not moved by its mover, \nmay happen in two ways. First, on account  of a hindrance arising from \nthe stronger power of some other mover; thus wood is not burnt by fire if \na stronger force of water intervene. Secondly, through lack of order in \nthe movable with regard to its mover, since, though it is subject to the \nlatter's action in one respect, yet it is not subject thereto in every \nrespect. Thus, a humor is sometimes subject to the action of heat, as \nregards being heated, but not as regards being dried up or consumed. In \nlike manner there are two reasons, for which a subject may not be bound \nto obey his superior in all things. First on account of the command of a \nhigher power. For as a gloss says on Rm. 13:2, \"They that resist [Vulg.: \n'He that resisteth'] the power, resist the ordinance of God\" (cf. St. \nAugustine, De Verb. Dom. viii). \"If a commissioner issue an order, are \nyou to comply, if it is contrary to the bidding of the proconsul? Again \nif the proconsul command one thing, and the emperor another, will you \nhesitate, to disregard the former and serve the latter? Therefore if the \nemperor commands one thing and God another, you must disregard the former \nand obey God.\" Secondly, a subject is not bound to obey his superior if \nthe latter command him to do something wherein he is not subject to him. \nFor Seneca says (De Beneficiis iii): \"It is wrong to suppose that slavery \nfalls upon the whole man: for the better part of him is excepted.\" His \nbody is subjected and assigned to his master but his soul is his own. \nConsequently in matters touching the internal movement of the will man is \nnot bound to obey his fellow-man, but God alone.\nNevertheless man is bound to obey his fellow-man in things that have to \nbe done externally by means of the body: and yet, since by nature all men \nare equal, he is not bound to obey another man in matters touching the \nnature of the body, for instance in those relating to the support of his \nbody or the begetting of his children. Wherefore servants are not bound \nto obey their masters, nor children their parents, in the question of \ncontracting marriage or of remaining in the state of virginity or the \nlike. But in matters concerning the disposal of actions and human \naffairs, a subject is bound to obey his superior within the sphere of his \nauthority; for instance a soldier must obey his general in matters \nrelating to war, a servant his master in matters touching the execution \nof the duties of his service, a son his father in matters relating to the \nconduct of his life and the care of the household; and so forth.",

If they be \nwilling to obey even in other matters, this will belong to the \nsuperabundance of perfection; provided, however, such things be not \ncontrary to God or to the rule they profess, for obedience in this case \nwould be unlawful.\nAccordingly we may distinguish a threefold obedience; one, sufficient \nfor salvation, and consisting in obeying when one is bound to obey: \nsecondly, perfect obedience, which obeys in all things lawful: thirdly, \nindiscreet obedience, which obeys even in matters unlawful."

First, on the part \nof the superior commanding, since, although a man should take every care \nto obey each superior, yet it is a greater duty to obey a higher than a \nlower authority, in sign of which the command of a lower authority is set \naside if it be contrary to the command of a higher authority. \nConsequently the higher the person who commands, the more grievous is it \nto disobey him: so that it is more grievous to disobey God than man. \nSecondly, on the part of the things commanded. For the person commanding \ndoes not equally desire the fulfilment of all his commands: since every \nsuch person desires above all the end, and that which is nearest to the \nend. Wherefore disobedience is the more grievous, according as the \nunfulfilled commandment is more in the intention of the person \ncommanding. As to the commandments of God, it is evident that the greater \nthe good commanded, the more grievous the disobedience of that \ncommandment, because since God's will is essentially directed to the \ngood, the greater the good the more does God wish it to be fulfilled. \nConsequently he that disobeys the commandment of the love of God sins \nmore grievously than one who disobeys the commandment of the love of our \nneighbor. On the other hand, man's will is not always directed to the \ngreater good: hence, when we are bound by a mere precept of man, a sin is \nmore grievous, not through setting aside a greater good, but through \nsetting aside that which is more in the intention of the person \ncommanding.\nAccordingly the various degrees of disobedience must correspond with the \nvarious degrees of precepts: because the disobedience in which there is \ncontempt of God's precept, from the very nature of disobedience is more \ngrievous than a sin committed against a man, apart from the latter being \na disobedience to God. And I say this because whoever sins against his \nneighbor acts also against God's commandment. And if the divine precept \nbe contemned in a yet graver matter, the sin is still more grievous. The \ndisobedience that contains contempt of a man's precept is less grievous \nthan the sin which contemns the man who made the precept, because \nreverence for the person commanding should give rise to reverence for his \ncommand.

And, as stated above with \nregard to a father (Question [31], Article [3]; Question [101],  Article [2]), a man owes his \nbenefactor, as such, honor and reverence, since the latter stands to him \nin the relation of principle; but accidentally he owes him assistance or \nsupport, if he need it.",

Wherefore if someone has conferred a favor, not as he ought to \nhave conferred it, the recipient should not for that reason withhold his \nthanks.

It is the height of malevolence to refuse to recognize a \nkindness, unless the giver has been the loser thereby.\"",

Wherefore, since every \nsin is voluntary, not excluding original sin, as stated above (FS, Question [81], Article [1]), it follows that no one is punished in this way, except for \nsomething done voluntarily. Secondly, punishment may be considered as a \nmedicine, not only healing the past sin, but also preserving from future \nsin, or conducing to some good, and in this way a person is sometimes \npunished without any fault of his own, yet not without cause.\nIt must, however, be observed that a medicine never removes a greater \ngood in order to promote a lesser; thus the medicine of the body never \nblinds the eye, in order to repair the heel: yet sometimes it is harmful \nin lesser things that it may be helpful in things of greater consequence. \nAnd since spiritual goods are of the greatest consequence, while temporal \ngoods are least important, sometimes a person is punished in his temporal \ngoods without any fault of his own. Such are many of the punishments \ninflicted by God in this present life for our humiliation or probation. \nBut no one is punished in spiritual goods without any fault on his part, \nneither in this nor in the future life, because in the latter punishment \nis not medicinal, but a result of spiritual  condemnation.",
        "RP1": "A man is never condemned to a spiritual punishment for \nanother man's sin, because spiritual punishment affects the soul, in \nrespect of which each man is master of himself. But sometimes a man is \ncondemned to punishment in temporal matters for the sin of another, and \nthis for three reasons. First, because one man may be the temporal goods \nof another, and so he may be punished in punishment of the latter: thus \nchildren, as to the body, are a belonging of their father, and slaves are \na possession of their master. Secondly, when one person's sin is \ntransmitted to another, either by \"imitation,\" as children copy the sins \nof their parents, and slaves the sins of their masters, so as to sin with \ngreater daring; or by way of \"merit,\" as the sinful subjects merit a \nsinful superior, according to Job 34:30, \"Who maketh a man that is a \nhypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?\" Hence the people of \nIsrael were punished for David's sin in numbering the people (2 Kgs. 24). \nThis may also happen through some kind of \"consent\" or \"connivance\": thus \nsometimes even the good are punished in temporal matters together with \nthe wicked, for not having condemned their sins, as Augustine says (De \nCiv. Dei i, 9). Thirdly, in order to mark the unity of human fellowship, \nwhereby one man is bound to be solicitous for another, lest he sin; and \nin order to inculcate horror of sin, seeing that the punishment of one \naffects all, as though all were one body, as Augustine says in speaking \nof the sin of Achan (Questions. sup. Josue viii). The saying of the Lord, \n\"Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third \nand fourth generation,\" seems to belong to mercy rather than to severity, \nsince He does not take vengeance forthwith, but waits for some future \ntime, in order that the descendants at least may mend their ways; yet \nshould the wickedness of the descendants increase, it becomes almost \nnecessary to take vengeance on them.",

But a man may be condemned, even \naccording to human judgment, to a punishment of forfeiture, even without \nany fault on his part, but not without cause: and this in three ways.\nFirst, through a person becoming, without any fault of his, disqualified \nfor having or acquiring a certain good: thus for being infected with \nleprosy a man is removed from the administration of the Church: and for \nbigamy, or through pronouncing a death sentence a man is hindered from \nreceiving sacred orders.\nSecondly, because the particular good that he forfeits is not his own \nbut common property: thus that an episcopal see be attached to a certain \nchurch belongs to the good of the whole city, and not only to the good of \nthe clerics.\nThirdly, because the good of one person may depend on the good of \nanother: thus in the crime of high treason a son loses his inheritance \nthrough the sin of his parent.",

        "RP3": "A person who says what is true, utters certain signs which \nare in conformity with things; and such signs are either words, or \nexternal actions, or any external thing.

Wherefore truth is neither a \ntheological, nor an intellectual, but a moral virtue. And it is a mean \nbetween excess and deficiency in two ways. First, on the part of the \nobject, secondly, on the part of the act. On the part of the object, \nbecause the true essentially denotes a kind of equality, and equal is a \nmean between more and less. Hence for the very reason that a man says \nwhat is true about himself, he observes the mean between one that says \nmore than the truth about himself, and one that says less than the truth. \nOn the part of the act, to observe the mean is to tell the truth, when \none ought, and as one ought.

Hence the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7) in describing this virtue: \"We are not \nspeaking of one who is truthful in his agreements, nor does this apply to \nmatters in which justice or injustice is questioned.\"\nThe truth of doctrine consists in a certain manifestation of truths \nrelating to science wherefore neither does this truth directly pertain to \nthis virtue, but only that truth whereby a man, both in life and in \nspeech, shows himself to be such as he is, and the things that concern \nhim, not other, and neither greater nor less, than they are. Nevertheless \nsince truths of science, as known by us, are something concerning us, and \npertain to this virtue, in  this sense the truth of doctrine may pertain \nto this virtue, as well as any other kind of truth whereby a man \nmanifests, by word or deed, what he knows."

Therefore the virtue of truth \ndoes not incline to that which is less rather than to that which is \ngreater.",

First, by affirming, as when a man does not show the whole \ngood that is in him, for instance science, holiness and so forth. This is \ndone without prejudice to truth, since the lesser is contained in the \ngreater: and in this way this virtue inclines to what is less. For, as \nthe Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7), \"this seems to be more prudent \nbecause exaggerations give annoyance.\" For those who represent themselves \nas being greater than they are, are a source of annoyance to others, \nsince they seem to wish to surpass others: whereas those who make less \naccount of themselves are a source of pleasure, since they seem to defer \nto others by their moderation.

But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that \nwhich he seeth in me or anything he heareth from me.\"\nSecondly, one may incline to what is less by denying, so as to say that \nwhat is in us is not. In this way it does not belong to  this virtue to \nincline to what is less, because this would imply falsehood. And yet this \nwould be less repugnant to the truth, not indeed as regards the proper \naspect of truth, but as regards the aspect of prudence, which should be \nsafeguarded in all the virtues.

        "ANS": "A moral act takes its species from two things, its \nobject, and its end: for the end is the object of the will,  which is the \nfirst mover in moral acts. And the power moved by the will has its own \nobject, which is the proximate object of the voluntary act, and stands in \nrelation to the will's act towards the end, as material to formal, as \nstated above (FS, Question [18], Articles [6],7).\nNow it has been said above (Question [109], Article [1], ad 3) that the virtue of \ntruth---and consequently the opposite vices---regards a manifestation \nmade by certain signs: and this manifestation or statement is an act of \nreason comparing sign with the thing signified; because every \nrepresentation consists in comparison, which is the proper act of the \nreason. Wherefore though dumb animals manifest something, yet they do not \nintend to manifest anything: but they do something by natural instinct, \nand a manifestation is the result. But when this manifestation or \nstatement is a moral act, it must needs be voluntary, and dependent on \nthe intention of the will. Now the proper object of a manifestation or \nstatement is the true or the false. And the intention of a bad will may \nbear on two things: one of which is that a falsehood may be told; while \nthe other is the proper effect of a false statement, namely, that someone \nmay be deceived.\nAccordingly if these three things concur, namely, falsehood of what is \nsaid, the will to tell a falsehood, and finally the intention to deceive, \nthen there is falsehood---materially, since what is said is false, \nformally, on account of the will to tell an untruth, and effectively, on \naccount of the will to impart a falsehood.\nHowever, the essential notion of a lie is taken from formal falsehood, \nfrom the fact namely, that a person intends to say what is false; \nwherefore also the word \"mendacium\" [lie] is derived from its being in \nopposition to the \"mind.\" Consequently if one says what is false, \nthinking it to be true, it is false materially, but not formally, because \nthe falseness is beside the intention of the speaker so that it is not a \nperfect lie, since what is beside the speaker's intention is accidental \nfor which reason it cannot be a specific difference. If, on the other \nhand, one utters' falsehood formally, through having the will to deceive, \neven if what one says be true, yet inasmuch as this is a voluntary and \nmoral act, it contains falseness essentially and truth accidentally, and \nattains the specific nature of a lie.\nThat a person intends to cause another to have a false opinion, by \ndeceiving him, does not belong to the species of lying, but to perfection \nthereof, even as in the physical order, a thing acquires its species if \nit has its form, even though the form's effect be lacking; for instance a \nheavy body which is held up aloft by force, lest it come down in \naccordance with the exigency of its form.

Now the sin of lying is aggravated, if \nby lying a person intends to injure another, and this is called a \n\"mischievous\" lie, while the sin of lying is diminished if it be directed \nto some good---either of pleasure and then it is a \"jocose\" lie, or of \nusefulness, and then we have the \"officious\" lie, whereby it is intended \nto help another person, or to save him from being injured. In this way \nlies are divided into the three kinds aforesaid.\nThirdly, lies are divided in a more general way, with respect to their \nrelation to some end, whether or not this increase or diminish their \ngravity: and in this way the division comprises eight kinds, as stated in \nthe Second Objection. Here the first three kinds are contained under \n\"mischievous\" lies, which are either against God, and then we have the \nlie \"in religious doctrine,\" or against man, and this either with the \nsole intention of injuring him, and then it is the second kind of lie, \nwhich \"profits no one, and injures someone\"; or with the intention of \ninjuring one and at the same time profiting another, and this is the \nthird kind of lie, \"which profits one, and injures another.\" Of these the \nfirst is the most grievous, because sins against God are always more \ngrievous, as stated above (FS, Question [73], Article [3]): and the second is more \ngrievous than the third, since the latter's gravity is diminished by the \nintention of profiting another.\nAfter these three, which aggravate the sin of lying, we have a fourth, \nwhich has its own measure of gravity without addition or diminution; and \nthis is the lie which is told \"out of mere lust of lying and deceiving.\" \nThis proceeds from a habit, wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7) \nthat \"the liar, when he lies from habit, delights in lying.\"\nThe four kinds that follow lessen the gravity of the sin of lying. For \nthe fifth kind is the jocose lie, which is told \"with a desire to \nplease\": and the remaining three are comprised under the officious lie, \nwherein something useful to another person is intended. This usefulness \nregards either external things, and then  we have the sixth kind of lie, \nwhich \"profits someone in saving his money\"; or his body, and this is the \nseventh kind, which \"saves a man from death\"; or the morality of his \nvirtue, and this is the eighth kind, which \"saves him from unlawful \ndefilement of his body.\"\nNow it is evident that the greater the good intended, the more is the \nsin of lying diminished in gravity. Wherefore a careful consideration of \nthe matter will show that these various kinds of lies are enumerated in \ntheir order of gravity: since the useful good is better than the \npleasurable good, and life of the body than money, and virtue than the \nlife of the body.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the Objections."

De Mend. xxi): \"Whoever thinks \nthat there is any kind of lie that is not a sin deceives himself \nshamefully, since he deems himself an honest man  when he deceives \nothers.\" Yet not every lie is a cause of deception, since no one is \ndeceived by a jocose lie; seeing that lies of this kind are told, not \nwith the intention of being believed, but merely for the sake of giving \npleasure. Hence again we find hyperbolical expressions in Holy Writ. \nTherefore not every lie is a sin.\nReply to  A man does not lie, so long as he has a mind to do what he \npromises, because he does not speak contrary to what he has in mind: but \nif he does not keep his promise, he seems to act without faith in \nchanging his mind. He may, however, be excused for two reasons. First, if \nhe has promised something evidently unlawful, because he sinned in \npromise, and did well to change his mind. Secondly, if circumstances have \nchanged with regard to persons and the business in hand. For, as Seneca \nstates (De Benef. iv), for a man to be bound to keep a promise, it is \nnecessary for everything to remain unchanged: otherwise neither did he \nlie in promising---since he promised what he had in his mind, due \ncircumstances being taken for granted---nor was he faithless in not \nkeeping his promise, because circumstances are no longer the same. Hence \nthe Apostle, though he did not go to Corinth, whither he had promised to \ngo (2 Cor. 1), did not lie, because obstacles had arisen which prevented \nhim.\nReply to Objection 6: An action may be considered in two ways. First, in itself, \nsecondly, with regard to the agent. Accordingly a jocose lie, from the \nvery genus of the action, is of a nature to deceive; although in the \nintention of the speaker it is not told to deceive, nor does it deceive \nby the way it is told. Nor is there any similarity in the hyperbolical or \nany kind of figurative  expressions, with which we meet in Holy Writ: \nbecause, as Augustine says (Lib. De Mend. v), \"it is not a lie to do or \nsay a thing figuratively: because every statement must be referred to the \nthing stated: and when a thing is done or said figuratively, it states \nwhat those to whom it is tendered understand it to signify.\"",

Nom. iv). Now a lie is evil in respect of its genus, since \nit is an action bearing on undue matter. For as words are naturally signs \nof intellectual acts, it is unnatural and undue for anyone to signify by \nwords something that is not in his mind. Hence the Philosopher says \n(Ethic. iv, 7) that \"lying is in itself evil and to be shunned, while \ntruthfulness is good and worthy of praise.\" Therefore every lie is a sin, \nas also Augustine declares (Contra Mend. i).",

Wherefore Abraham himself said (Gn. 20:12): \"She is truly my \nsister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother,\" \nbeing related to him on his father's side. Jacob's assertion that he was \nEsau, Isaac's first-born, was spoken in a mystical sense, because, to \nwit, the latter's birthright was due to him by right: and he made use of \nthis mode of speech being moved by the spirit of prophecy, in order to \nsignify a mystery, namely, that the younger people, i.e. the Gentiles, \nshould supplant the first-born, i.e. the Jews.\nSome, however, are commended in the Scriptures, not on account of \nperfect virtue, but for a certain virtuous disposition, seeing that it \nwas owing to some praiseworthy sentiment that they were moved to do \ncertain undue things. It is thus that Judith is praised, not for lying to \nHolofernes, but for her desire to save the people, to which end she \nexposed herself to danger.

For if this be about divine things, it is contrary to the \ncharity of God, whose truth one hides or corrupts by such a lie; so that \na lie of this kind is opposed not only to the virtue of charity, but also \nto the virtues of faith and religion: wherefore it is a most grievous and \na mortal sin. If, however, the false signification be about something the \nknowledge of which affects a man's good, for instance if it pertain to \nthe perfection of science or to moral conduct, a lie of this description \ninflicts an injury on one's neighbor, since it causes him to have a false \nopinion, wherefore it is contrary to charity, as regards the love of our \nneighbor, and consequently is a mortal sin. On the other hand, if the \nfalse opinion engendered by the lie be about some matter the knowledge of \nwhich is of no consequence, then the lie in question does no harm to \none's neighbor; for instance, if a person be deceived as to some \ncontingent particulars that do not concern him.

        "ANS": "The obstacles to true religion being removed by the first \nand second precepts of the decalogue, as stated above (Articles [2],3), it \nremained for the third precept to be given whereby man is established in \ntrue religion. Now it belongs to religion to give worship to God: and \njust as the Divine scriptures teach the  interior worship under the guise \nof certain corporal similitudes, so is external worship given to God \nunder the guise of sensible signs. And since for the most part man is \ninduced to pay interior worship, consisting in prayer and devotion, by \nthe interior prompting of the Holy Ghost, a precept of the Law as \nnecessary respecting the exterior worship that consists in sensible \nsigns. Now the precepts of the decalogue are, so to speak, first and \ncommon principles of the Law, and consequently the third precept of the \ndecalogue describes the exterior worship of God as the sign of a \nuniversal boon that concerns all. This universal boon was the work of the \nCreation of the world, from which work God is stated to have rested on \nthe seventh day: and sign of this we are commanded to keep holy seventh \nday---that is, to set it aside as a day to be given to God.

        "RP1": "The precept about hallowing the Sabbath, understood \nliterally, is partly oral and partly ceremonial. It is a moral precept in \nthe point of commanding man to aside a certain time to be given to Divine \nthings. For there is in man a natural inclination to set aside a certain \ntime for each necessary thing, such as refreshment of the body, sleep, \nand so forth. Hence according to the dictate of reason, man sets aside a \ncertain time for spiritual refreshment, by which man's mind is refreshed \nin God. And thus to have a certain time set aside for occupying oneself \nwith Divine things is the matter of a moral precept. But, in so far as \nthis precept specializes the time as a sign representing the Creation of \nthe world, it is a ceremonial precept. Again, it is a ceremonial precept \nin its allegorical signification, as representative of Christ's rest in \nthe tomb on the seventh day: also in its moral signification, as \nrepresenting cessation from all sinful acts, and the mind's rest in God, \nin which sense, too, it is a general precept. Again, it is a ceremonial \nprecept in its analogical signification, as foreshadowing the enjoyment \nof God in heaven. Hence the precept about hallowing the Sabbath is placed \namong the precepts of the decalogue, as a moral, but not as a ceremonial \nprecept.",
        "RP2": "The other ceremonies of the Law are signs of certain \nparticular Divine works: but the observance of the Sabbath is \nrepresentative of a general boon, namely, the production of all \ncreatures. Hence it was fitting that it should be placed among the \ngeneral precepts of the decalogue, rather than any other ceremonial \nprecept of the Law.",
        "RP3": "Two things are to be observed in the hallowing of the \nSabbath. One of these is the end: and this is that man occupy himself \nwith Divine things, and is signified in the words: \"Remember that thou \nkeep holy the Sabbath day.\" For in the Law those things are said to be \nholy which are applied to the Divine worship. The other thing is \ncessation from work, and is signified in the words (Ex. 20:11), \"On the \nseventh day . . . thou shalt do no work.\" The kind of work meant appears \nfrom Lev. 23:3, \"You shall  do no servile work on that day [*Vulg.: 'You \nshall do no work on that day'].\" Now servile work is so called from \nservitude: and servitude is threefold. One, whereby man is the servant of \nsin, according to Jn. 8:34, \"Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of \nsin,\" and in this sense all sinful acts are servile. Another servitude is \nwhereby one man serves another. Now one man serves another not with his \nmind but with his body, as stated above (Question [104], Articles [5],6, ad 1). \nWherefore in this respect those works are called servile whereby one man \nserves another. The third is the servitude of God; and in this way the \nwork of worship, which pertains to the service of God, may be called a \nservile work. In this sense servile work is not forbidden on the Sabbath \nday, because that would be contrary to the end of the Sabbath observance: \nsince man abstains from other works on the Sabbath day in order that he \nmay occupy himself with works connected with God's service. For this \nreason, according to Jn. 7:23, \"a man [*Vulg.: 'If a man,' etc.] receives \ncircumcision on the Sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be \nbroken\": and for this reason too we read (Mt. 12:5), that \"on the Sabbath \ndays the priests in the temple break the Sabbath,\" i.e. do corporal works \non the Sabbath, \"and are without blame.\" Accordingly, the priests in \ncarrying the ark on the Sabbath did not break the precept of the Sabbath \nobservance. In like manner it is not contrary to the observance of the \nSabbath to exercise any spiritual act, such as teaching by word or \nwriting. Wherefore a gloss on Num 28 says that \"smiths and like craftsmen \nrest on the Sabbath day, but the reader or teacher of the Divine law does \nnot cease from his work. Yet he profanes not the Sabbath, even as the \npriests in the temple break the Sabbath, and are without blame.\" On the \nother hand, those works that are called servile in the first or second \nway are contrary to the observance of the Sabbath, in so far as they \nhinder man from applying himself to Divine things. And since man is \nhindered from applying himself to Divine things rather by sinful than by \nlawful albeit corporal works, it follows that to sin on a feast day is \nmore against this precept than to do some other but lawful bodily work. \nHence Augustine says (De decem chord. iii): \"It would be better if the \nJew did some useful work on his farm than spent his time seditiously in \nthe theatre: and their womenfolk would do better to be making linen on \nthe Sabbath than to be dancing lewdly all day in their feasts of the new \nmoon.\" It is not, however, against this precept to sin venially on the \nSabbath, because venial sin does not destroy holiness.\nAgain, corporal works, not pertaining to the spiritual worship of God, \nare said to be servile in so far as they belong properly to servants; \nwhile they are not said to be servile, in so far as they are common to \nthose who serve and those who are free. Moreover, everyone, be he servant \nor free, is bound to provide necessaries both for himself and for his \nneighbor, chiefly in respect of things pertaining to the well-being of \nthe body, according to Prov. 24:11, \"Deliver them that are led to death\": \nsecondarily as regards avoiding damage to one's property, according to \nDt. 22:1, \"Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother's ox or his \nsheep go astray, but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother.\" Hence a \ncorporal work pertaining to the preservation of one's own bodily  \nwell-being does not profane the Sabbath: for it is not against the \nobservance of the Sabbath to eat and do such things as preserve the \nhealth of the body. For this reason the Machabees did not profane the \nSabbath when they fought in self-defense on the Sabbath day (1 Macc. 2), \nnor Elias when he fled from the face of Jezabel on the Sabbath. For this \nsame reason our Lord (Mt. 12:3) excused His disciples for plucking the \nears of corn on account of the need which they suffered. In like manner a \nbodily work that is directed to the bodily well-being of another is not \ncontrary to the observance of the Sabbath: wherefore it is written (Jn. 7:23): \"Are you angry at Me because I have healed the whole man on the \nSabbath day?\" And again, a bodily work that is done to avoid an imminent \ndamage to some external thing does not profane the Sabbath, wherefore our \nLord says (Mt. 12:11): \"What man shall there be among you, that hath one \nsheep, and if the same fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not \ntake hold on it and lift it up?\"",
        "RP4": "In the New Law the observance of the Lord's day took the \nplace of the observance of the Sabbath, not by virtue of the precept but \nby the institution of the Church and the custom of Christian people. For \nthis observance is not figurative, as was the observance of the Sabbath \nin the Old Law. Hence the prohibition to work on the Lord' day is not so \nstrict as on the Sabbath: and certain works are permitted on the Lord's \nday which were forbidden on the Sabbath, such as the cooking of food and \nso forth. And again in the New Law, dispensation is more easily granted \nthan in the Old, in the matter of certain forbidden works, on account of \ntheir necessity, because the figure pertains to the protestation of \ntruth, which it is unlawful to omit even in small things; while works, \nconsidered in themselves, are changeable in point of place and time."

Because the man \nwho is grateful for a favor deserves, with a certain congruity, that the \nfavor should be continued to him, and he who is ungrateful for a favor \ndeserves to lose it.

Now man's good is to be in accordance \nwith reason, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv, 22). Wherefore it \nbelongs to human virtue to make man good, to make his work accord with \nreason. This happens in three ways: first, by rectifying reason itself, \nand this is done by  the intellectual virtues; secondly, by establishing \nthe rectitude of reason in human affairs, and this belongs to justice; \nthirdly, by removing the obstacles to the establishment of this rectitude \nin human affairs. Now the human will is hindered in two ways from \nfollowing the rectitude of reason. First, through being drawn by some \nobject of pleasure to something other than what the rectitude of reason \nrequires; and this obstacle is removed by the virtue of temperance. \nSecondly, through the will being disinclined to follow that which is in \naccordance with reason, on account of some difficulty that presents \nitself. In order to remove this obstacle fortitude of the mind is \nrequisite, whereby to resist the aforesaid difficulty even as a man, by \nfortitude of body, overcomes and removes bodily obstacles.\nHence it is evident that fortitude is a virtue, in so far as it conforms \nman to reason.",

This may be done in three ways. \nFirst, because they tend to that which is difficult as though it were not \ndifficult: and this again happens in three ways, for sometimes this is \nowing to ignorance, through not perceiving the greatness of the danger; \nsometimes it is owing to the fact that one is hopeful of overcoming \ndangers---when, for instance, one has often experienced escape from \ndanger; and sometimes this is owing to a certain science and art, as in \nthe case of soldiers who, through skill and practice in the use of arms, \nthink little of the dangers of battle, as they reckon themselves capable \nof defending themselves against them; thus Vegetius says (De Re Milit. \ni), \"No man fears to do what he is confident of having learned to do \nwell.\" Secondly, a man performs an act of fortitude without having the \nvirtue, through the impulse of a passion, whether of sorrow that he \nwishes to cast off, or again of anger.

And since this latter \nmeaning is the more common, the term \"virtue,\" as denoting the extreme \nlimit of such a power, is a common term, for virtue taken in a general \nsense is nothing else than a habit whereby one acts well.

Hence fortitude of soul must be \nthat which binds the will firmly to the good of reason in face of the \ngreatest evils: because he that stands firm against great things, will in \nconsequence stand firm against less things, but not conversely. Moreover \nit belongs to the notion of virtue that it should regard something \nextreme: and the most fearful of all bodily evils is death, since it does \naway all bodily goods.

Wherefore if a person without forethought does that which \npertains to virtue, when necessity urges on account of some sudden \ndanger, this is a very strong proof that habitual fortitude is firmly  \nseated in his mind.\nYet is it possible for a person even without the habit of fortitude, to \nprepare his mind against danger by long forethought: in the same way as a \nbrave man prepares himself when necessary.

But if as a \nChristian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.\" \nNow a man is said to be a Christian because he holds the faith of Christ. \nTherefore only faith in Christ gives the glory of martyrdom to those who \nsuffer.",

Now this truth is the truth of faith. \nWherefore the cause of all martyrdom is the truth of faith.\nBut the truth of faith includes not only inward belief, but also outward \nprofession, which is expressed not only by words, whereby one confesses \nthe faith, but also by deeds, whereby a person shows that he has faith, \naccording to James 2:18, \"I will show thee, by works, my faith.\" Hence it \nis written of certain people (Titus 1:16): \"They profess that they know \nGod but in their works they deny Him.\" Thus all virtuous deeds, inasmuch \nas they are referred to God, are professions of the faith whereby we come \nto know that God requires these works of us, and rewards us for them: and \nin this way they can be the cause of martyrdom. For this reason the \nChurch celebrates the martyrdom of Blessed John the Baptist, who suffered \ndeath, not for refusing to deny the faith, but for reproving adultery.",

Now a person is said to \nbe Christ's, not only through having faith in Christ, but also because he \nis actuated to virtuous deeds by the Spirit of Christ, according to Rm. \n8:9, \"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His\"; and \nagain because in imitation of Christ he is dead to sins, according to \nGal. 5:24, \"They that are Christ's have crucified their flesh with the \nvices and concupiscences.\" Hence to suffer as a Christian is not only to \nsuffer in confession of the faith, which is done by words, but also to \nsuffer for doing any good work, or for avoiding any sin, for Christ's \nsake, because this all comes under the head of witnessing to the faith.",

Rhet. ii) assigns four parts to fortitude, namely \n\"magnificence,\" \"confidence,\" \"patience,\" and \"perseverance.\" Now \nmagnificence seems to pertain to liberality; since both are concerned \nabout money, and \"a magnificent man must needs be liberal,\" as the \nPhilosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 2). But liberality is a part of justice, \nas stated above (Question [117], Article [5]). Therefore magnificence should not be \nreckoned a part of fortitude.",
        "OB2": "Further, confidence is apparently the same as hope. But hope does \nnot seem to pertain to fortitude, but is rather a virtue by itself. \nTherefore confidence should not be reckoned a part of fortitude.",
        "OB3": "Further, fortitude makes a man behave aright in face of danger. \nBut magnificence and confidence do not essentially imply any relation to \ndanger. Therefore they are not suitably reckoned as parts of fortitude.",
        "OB4": "Further, according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) patience \ndenotes endurance of hardships, and he ascribes the same to fortitude. \nTherefore patience is the same as fortitude and not a part thereof.",
        "OB5": "Further, that which is a requisite to every virtue should not be \nreckoned a part of a special virtue. But perseverance is required in \nevery virtue: for it is written (Mt. 24:13): \"He that shall persevere to \nthe end he shall be saved.\" Therefore perseverance should not be \naccounted a part of fortitude.\nObjection 6: Further, Macrobius (De Somn. Scip. i) reckons seven parts of \nfortitude, namely \"magnanimity, confidence, security, magnificence, \nconstancy, forbearance, stability.\" Andronicus also reckons seven virtues \nannexed to fortitude, and these are, \"courage, strength of will, \nmagnanimity, manliness, perseverance, magnificence.\" Therefore it seems \nthat Tully's reckoning of the parts of fortitude is incomplete.\nObjection 7: Further, Aristotle (Ethic. iii) reckons five parts of fortitude. \nThe first is \"civic\" fortitude, which produces brave deeds through fear \nof dishonor or punishment; the second is \"military\" fortitude, which \nproduces brave deeds as a result of warlike art or experience; the third \nis the fortitude which produces brave deeds resulting from passion, \nespecially anger; the fourth is the fortitude which makes a man act \nbravely through being accustomed to overcome; the fifth is the fortitude \nwhich makes a man act bravely through being unaccustomed to danger. Now \nthese kinds of fortitude are not comprised under any of the above \nenumerations. Therefore these enumerations of the parts of fortitude are \nunfitting.\nReply to  Perseverance as denoting persistence in a good deed unto \nthe end, may be a circumstance of every virtue, but it is reckoned a part \nof fortitude in the sense stated in the body of the Article.\nReply to Objection 6: Macrobius reckons the four aforesaid mentioned by Tully, \nnamely \"confidence, magnificence, forbearance,\" which he puts in the \nplace of patience, and \"firmness,\" which he substitutes for perseverance. \nAnd he adds three, two of which, namely \"magnanimity\" and \"security,\" are \ncomprised by Tully under the head of confidence. But Macrobius is more \nspecific in his enumeration. Because confidence denotes a man's hope for \ngreat things: and hope for anything presupposes an appetite stretching \nforth to great things by desire, and this belongs to magnanimity. For it \nhas been stated above (FS, Question [40], Article [2]) that hope presupposes love and \ndesire of the thing hoped for.\nA still better reply is that confidence pertains to the certitude of \nhope; while magnanimity refers to the magnitude of the thing hoped for. \nNow hope has no firmness unless its contrary be removed, for sometimes \none, for one's own part, would hope for something, but hope is avoided on \naccount of the obstacle of fear, since fear is somewhat contrary to hope, \nas stated above, (FS, Question [40], Article [4], ad 1). Hence Macrobius adds security, \nwhich banishes fear. He adds a third, namely constancy, which may be \ncomprised under magnificence. For in performing deeds of magnificence one \nneeds to have a constant mind. For this reason Tully says that \nmagnificence consists not only in accomplishing great things, but also in \ndiscussing them generously in the mind. Constancy may also pertain to \nperseverance, so that one may be called persevering through not desisting \non account of delays, and constant through not desisting on account of \nany other obstacles.\nThose that are mentioned by Andronicus seem to amount to the same as the \nabove. For with Tully and Macrobius he mentions \"perseverance\" and \n\"magnificence,\" and with Macrobius, \"magnanimity.\" \"Strength of will\" is \nthe same as patience or forbearance, for he says that \"strength of will \nis a habit that  makes one ready to attempt what ought to be attempted, \nand to endure what reason says should be endured\"---i.e. good courage \nseems to be the same as assurance, for he defines it as \"strength of soul \nin the accomplishment of its purpose.\" Manliness is apparently the same \nas confidence, for he says that \"manliness is a habit of self-sufficiency \nin matters of virtue.\" Besides magnificence he mentions {andragathia}, \ni.e. manly goodness which we may render \"strenuousness.\" For magnificence \nconsists not only in being constant in the accomplishment of great deeds, \nwhich belongs to constancy, but also in bringing a certain manly prudence \nand solicitude to that accomplishment, and this belongs to {andragathia}, \nstrenuousness: wherefore he says that {andragathia} is the virtue of a \nman, whereby he thinks out profitable works.\nAccordingly it is evident that all these parts may be reduced to the \nfour principal parts mentioned by Tully.\nReply to Objection 7: The five mentioned by Aristotle fall short of the true \nnotion of virtue, for though they concur in the act of fortitude, they \ndiffer as to motive, as stated above (Question [123], Article [1], ad 2); wherefore they \nare not reckoned parts but modes of fortitude.",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [48]), a virtue can have three kinds of \nparts, subjective, integral, and potential. But fortitude, taken as a \nspecial virtue, cannot have subjective parts, since it is not divided \ninto several specifically distinct virtues, for it  is about a very \nspecial matter.\nHowever, there are quasi-integral and potential parts assigned to it: \nintegral parts, with regard to those things the concurrence of which is \nrequisite for an act of fortitude; and potential parts, because what \nfortitude practices in face of the greatest hardships, namely dangers of \ndeath, certain other virtues practice in the matter of certain minor \nhardships and these virtues are annexed to fortitude as secondary virtues \nto the principal virtue. As stated above (Question [123], Articles [3],6), the act of \nfortitude is twofold, aggression and endurance. Now two things are \nrequired for the act of aggression. The first regards preparation of the \nmind, and consists in one's having a mind ready for aggression. In this \nrespect Tully mentions \"confidence,\" of which he says (De Invent. Rhet. \nii) that \"with this the mind is much assured and firmly hopeful in great \nand honorable undertakings.\" The second regards the accomplishment of the \ndeed, and consists in not failing to accomplish what one has confidently \nbegun. In this respect Tully mentions \"magnificence,\" which he describes \nas being \"the discussion and administration,\" i.e. accomplishment \"of \ngreat and lofty undertakings, with a certain broad and noble purpose of \nmind,\" so as to combine execution with greatness of purpose. Accordingly \nif these two be confined to the proper matter of fortitude, namely to \ndangers of death, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof, because \nwithout them there can be no fortitude; whereas if they be referred to \nother matters involving less hardship, they will be virtues specifically \ndistinct from fortitude, but annexed thereto as secondary virtues to \nprincipal: thus \"magnificence\" is referred by the Philosopher (Ethic. iv) \nto great expenses, and \"magnanimity,\" which seems to be the same as \nconfidence, to great honors. Again, two things are requisite for the \nother act of fortitude, viz. endurance. The first is that the mind be not \nbroken by sorrow, and fall away from its greatness, by reason of the \nstress of threatening evil. In this respect he mentions \"patience,\" which \nhe describes as \"the voluntary and prolonged endurance of arduous and \ndifficult things for the sake of virtue or profit.\" The other is that by \nthe prolonged suffering of hardships man be not wearied so as to lose \ncourage, according to Heb. 12:3, \"That you be not wearied, fainting in \nyour minds.\" In this respect he mentions \"perseverance,\" which \naccordingly he describes as \"the fixed and continued persistence in a \nwell considered purpose.\" If these two be confined to the proper matter \nof fortitude, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof; but if they be \nreferred to any kind of hardship they will be virtues distinct from \nfortitude, yet annexed thereto as secondary to principal.",

Now virtue bears a relationship to two things, \nfirst to the matter about which is the field of its activity, secondly to \nits proper act, which consists in the right use of such matter. And since \na virtuous habit is denominated chiefly from its act, a man is said to be \nmagnanimous chiefly because he is minded to do some great act. Now an act \nmay be called great in two ways: in one way proportionately, in another \nabsolutely. An act may be called great proportionately, even if it \nconsist in the use of some small or ordinary thing, if, for instance, one \nmake a very good use of it: but an act is simply and absolutely great \nwhen it consists in the best use of the greatest thing.\nThe things which come into man's use are external things, and among \nthese honor is the greatest simply, both because it is the most akin to \nvirtue, since it is an attestation to a person's virtue, as stated above \n(Question [103], Articles [1],2); and because it is offered to God and to the best; and \nagain because, in order to obtain honor even as to avoid shame, men set \naside all other things.

        "OB3": "Further, small honor is less aloof from great honor than is \ndishonor. But magnanimity is well ordered in relation to dishonor, and \nconsequently in relation to small honors also. Therefore it is not only \nabout great honors.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7) that magnanimity is \nabout great honors.\nI answer that According to the Philosopher (Phys. vii, 17, 18), virtue \nis a perfection, and by this we are to understand the perfection of a \npower, and that it regards the extreme limit of that power, as stated in \nDe Coelo i, 116. Now the perfection of a power is not perceived in every \noperation of that power, but in such operations as are great or \ndifficult: for every power, however imperfect, can extend to ordinary and \ntrifling operations. Hence it is essential to a virtue to be about the \ndifficult and the good, as stated in Ethic. ii, 3.\nNow the difficult and the good (which amount to the same) in an act of \nvirtue may be considered from two points of view. First, from the point \nof view of reason, in so far as it is difficult to find and establish the \nrational means in some particular matter: and this difficulty is found \nonly in the act of intellectual virtues, and also of justice. The other \ndifficulty is on the part of the matter, which may involve a certain \nopposition to the moderation of reason, which moderation has to be \napplied thereto: and this difficulty regards chiefly the other moral \nvirtues, which are about the passions, because the passions resist reason \nas Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv, 4).\nNow as regards the passions it is to be observed that the greatness of \nthis power of resistance to reason arises chiefly in  some cases from the \npassions themselves, and in others from the things that are the objects \nof the passions. The passions themselves have no great power of \nresistance, unless they be violent, because the sensitive appetite, which \nis the seat of the passions, is naturally subject to reason. Hence the \nresisting virtues that are about these passions regard only that which is \ngreat in such passions: thus fortitude is about very great fear and \ndaring; temperance about the concupiscence of the greatest pleasures, and \nlikewise meekness about the greatest anger. On the other hand, some \npassions have great power of resistance to reason arising from the \nexternal things themselves that are the objects of those passions: such \nare the love or desire of money or of honor. And for these it is \nnecessary to have a virtue not only regarding that which is greatest in \nthose passions, but also about that which is ordinary or little: because \nthings external, though they be little, are very desirable, as being \nnecessary for human life. Hence with regard to the desire of money there \nare two virtues, one about ordinary or little sums of money, namely \nliberality, and another about large sums of money, namely \"magnificence.\"\nIn like manner there are two virtues about honors, one about ordinary \nhonors. This virtue has no name, but is denominated by its extremes, \nwhich are {philotimia}, i.e. love of honor, and {aphilotimia}, i.e. \nwithout love of honor: for sometimes a man is commended for loving honor, \nand sometimes for not caring about it, in so far, to wit, as both these \nthings may be done in moderation. But with regard to great honors there \nis \"magnanimity.\" Wherefore we must conclude that the proper matter of \nmagnanimity is great honor, and that a magnanimous man tends to such \nthings as are deserving of honor.",
        "RP1": "Great and little are accidental to honor considered in \nitself: but they make a great difference in their relation to reason, the \nmode of which has to be observed in the use of honor, for it is much more \ndifficult to observe it in great than in little honors.",

Accordingly the magnanimous man looks \nupon great honors as a thing of which he is worthy, or even little honors \nas something he deserves, because, to wit, man cannot sufficiently honor \nvirtue which deserves to be honored by God. Hence he is not uplifted by \ngreat honors, because he does not deem them above him; rather does he \ndespise them, and much more such as are ordinary or little. In like \nmanner he is not cast down by dishonor, but despises it, since he \nrecognizes that he does not deserve it."

        "OB3": "Further, magnanimity regards the great in things to be hoped for, \nwhereas fortitude regards the great in things to be feared or dared. But \ngood is of more import than evil. Therefore magnanimity is a more \nimportant virtue than fortitude. Therefore it is not a part thereof.",

And this is chiefly commended in those virtues that tend to \nsomething difficult, in which it is most difficult to preserve firmness. \nWherefore the more difficult it is to stand firm in some matter of \ndifficulty, the more principal is the virtue which makes the mind firm in \nthat matter.\nNow it is more difficult to stand firm in dangers of death, wherein \nfortitude confirms the mind, than in hoping for or obtaining the greatest \ngoods, wherein the mind is confirmed by magnanimity, for, as man loves \nhis life above all things, so does he fly from dangers of death more than \nany others. Accordingly it is clear that magnanimity agrees with \nfortitude in confirming the mind about some difficult matter; but it \nfalls short thereof, in that it confirms the mind about a matter wherein \nit is easier to stand firm.

Since, however, there is a difference as regards \nthe difficulty on the part of either of the aforesaid, it follows that \nproperly speaking magnanimity, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, \n7), is a distinct virtue from fortitude.",

But for things that are truly great, a \nmagnanimous man is most ready to  expose himself to danger, since he does \nsomething great in the act of fortitude, even as in the acts of the other \nvirtues. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7) that the magnanimous \nman is not {mikrokindynos}, i.e. endangering himself for small things, \nbut {megalokindynos}, i.e. endangering himself for great things. And \nSeneca says (De Quat. Virtut.): \"Thou wilt be magnanimous if thou neither \nseekest dangers like a rash man, nor fearest them like a coward.

Accordingly, in so far as he \nneeds others, it belongs to a magnanimous man to have confidence in \nothers, for it is also a point of excellence in a man that he should have \nat hand those who are able to be of service to him.

Now confidence denotes a certain strength of hope, wherefore it \nis opposed to fear even as hope is. Since, however, fortitude properly \nstrengthens a man in respect of evil, and magnanimity in respect of the \nobtaining of good, it follows that confidence belongs more properly to \nmagnanimity than to fortitude.

Since, however, that which is clear simply can be seen \nby many, and by those who are far away, it follows that the word glory \nproperly denotes that somebody's good is known and approved by many, \naccording to the saying of Sallust (Catilin.)

Now it is not a sin to know and approve one's own good: for it is \nwritten (1 Cor. 2:12): \"Now we have received not the spirit of this \nworld, but the Spirit that is of God that we may know the things that are \ngiven us from God.\"  Likewise it is not a sin to be willing to approve \none's own good works: for it is written (Mt. 5:16): \"Let your light shine \nbefore men.\" Hence the desire for glory does not, of itself, denote a \nsin: but the desire for empty or vain glory denotes a sin: for it is \nsinful to desire anything vain, according to Ps. 4:3, \"Why do you love \nvanity, and seek after lying?\"\nNow glory may be called vain in three ways. First, on the part of the \nthing for which one seeks glory: as when a man seeks glory for that which \nis unworthy of glory, for instance when he seeks it for something frail \nand perishable: secondly, on the part of him from whom he seeks glory, \nfor instance a man whose judgment is uncertain: thirdly, on the part of \nthe man himself who seeks glory, for that he does not refer the desire of \nhis own glory to a due end, such as God's honor, or the spiritual welfare \nof his neighbor.",

Wherefore Augustine says (De \nPatientia ii): \"A man's patience it is whereby he bears evil with an \nequal mind,\" i.e. without being disturbed by sorrow, \"lest he abandon \nwith an unequal mind the goods whereby he may advance to better things.\" \nIt is therefore  evident that patience is a virtue.",

In like manner the act of patience, in heaven, will not \nconsist in bearing things, but in enjoying the goods to which we had \naspired by suffering. Hence Augustine says (De Civ.

Hence longanimity has more in common with \nmagnanimity than with patience.\nNevertheless it may have something in common with patience, for two \nreasons. First, because patience, like fortitude, endures certain evils \nfor the sake of good, and if this good is awaited shortly, endurance is \neasier: whereas if it be delayed a long time, it is more difficult. \nSecondly, because the very delay of the good we hope for, is of a nature \nto cause sorrow, according to Prov. 13:12, \"Hope that is deferred \nafflicteth the soul.\" Hence there may be patience in bearing this trial, \nas in enduring any other sorrows. Accordingly longanimity and constancy \nare both comprised under patience, in so far as both the delay of the \nhoped for good (which regards longanimity) and the toil which man endures \nin persistently accomplishing a good work (which regards constancy) may \nbe considered under the one aspect of grievous evil.\nFor this reason Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) in defining patience, says \nthat \"patience is the voluntary and prolonged endurance of arduous and \ndifficult things for the sake of virtue or profit.\" By saying \"arduous\" \nhe refers to constancy in good; when he says \"difficult\" he refers to the \ngrievousness of evil, which is the proper object of patience; and by \nadding \"continued\" or \"long lasting,\" he refers to longanimity, in so far \nas it has something in common with patience.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the First and Second Objections.",

We must observe, however, that the reason \nfor the difference assigned by this gloss is that it is hard to bear with \nthose who sin through weakness, merely because they persist a long time \nin evil, wherefore it is said that they are borne with longanimity: \nwhereas the very fact of sinning through pride seems to be unendurable; \nfor which reason those who sin through pride are stated to be borne with \npatience."

On the other \nhand, if we take perseverance as denoting long persistence in any kind of \ndifficult good, it is consistent in one who has even perfect virtue: for \neven if it is less difficult for him to persist, yet he persists in the \nmore perfect good.

Because sensible and bodily goods, \nconsidered in their species, are not in opposition to reason, but are \nsubject to it as instruments which reason employs in order to attain its \nproper end: and that they are opposed to reason is owing to the fact that \nthe sensitive appetite fails to tend towards them in accord with the mode \nof reason. Hence it belongs properly to moral virtue to moderate those \npassions which denote a pursuit of the good.\nOn the other hand, the movement of the sensitive appetite in flying from \nsensible evil is mostly in opposition to reason, not through being \nimmoderate, but chiefly in respect of its flight: because, when a man \nflies from sensible and bodily evils, which sometimes accompany the good \nof reason, the result is that he flies from the good of reason. Hence it \nbelongs to moral virtue to make man while flying from evil to remain firm \nin the good of reason.\nAccordingly, just as the virtue of fortitude, which by its very nature \nbestows firmness, is chiefly concerned with the passion, viz. fear, which \nregards flight from bodily evils, and consequently with daring, which \nattacks the objects of fear in the hope of attaining some good, so, too, \ntemperance, which denotes a kind of moderation, is chiefly concerned with \nthose passions that tend towards sensible goods, viz. desire and \npleasure, and consequently with the sorrows that arise from the absence \nof those pleasures.

Hence, while temperance directly moderates the passions of \nthe concupiscible which tend towards good, as a consequence, it moderates \nall the other passions, inasmuch as moderation of the passions that \nprecede results in moderation of the passions that follow: since he that \nis not immoderate in desire is moderate in hope, and grieves moderately \nfor the absence of the things he desires.",

Thus, for the  sake of the body's health, \ncertain persons refrain from pleasures of meat, drink, and sex; as also \nfor the fulfilment of certain engagements: thus athletes and soldiers \nhave to deny themselves many pleasures, in order to fulfil their \nrespective duties. In like manner penitents, in order to recover health \nof soul, have recourse to abstinence from pleasures, as a kind of diet, \nand those who are desirous of giving themselves up to contemplation and \nDivine things need much to refrain from carnal things. Nor do any of \nthese things pertain to the vice of insensibility, because they are in \naccord with right reason.",

Yet this need for using pleasures of the body will be greater \nor less, according as man needs more or less the powers of his body in \naccomplishing the act of reason. Wherefore it is commendable for those \nwho undertake the duty of giving themselves to contemplation, and of \nimparting to others a spiritual good, by a kind of spiritual procreation, \nas it were, to abstain from many pleasures, but not for those who are in \nduty bound to bodily occupations and carnal procreation.",

        "ANS": "A thing is said to be childish for two reasons. First, \nbecause it is becoming to children, and the Philosopher does not mean \nthat the sin of intemperance is childish in this sense. Secondly. by way \nof likeness, and it is in this sense that sins of intemperance are said \nto be childish. For the sin of intemperance is one of unchecked \nconcupiscence, which is likened to a child in three ways. First, as \nrewards that which they both desire, for like a child concupiscence \ndesires something disgraceful. This is because in human affairs a thing \nis beautiful according as it harmonizes with reason. Wherefore Tully says \n(De Offic. i, 27) under the heading \"Comeliness is twofold,\" that \"the \nbeautiful is that which is in keeping with man's excellence in so far as \nhis nature differs from other animals.\" Now a child does not attend to \nthe order of reason; and in like manner \"concupiscence does not listen to \nreason,\" according to Ethic. vii, 6. Secondly, they are alike as to the \nresult. For a child, if left to his own will, becomes more self-willed: \nhence it is written (Ecclus. 30:8): \"A horse not broken becometh \nstubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong.\" So, too, \nconcupiscence, if indulged, gathers strength: wherefore Augustine says \n(Confess. viii, 5): \"Lust served became a custom, and custom not resisted \nbecame necessity.\" Thirdly, as to the remedy which is applied to both. \nFor a child is corrected by being restrained; hence it is written (Prov. 23:13,14): \"Withhold not correction from a child . . . Thou shalt beat \nhim with a rod, and deliver his soul from Hell.\" In like manner by \nresisting concupiscence we moderate it according to the demands of \nvirtue. Augustine indicates this when he says (Music. vi, 11) that if the \nmind be lifted up to spiritual things, and remain fixed \"thereon, the \nimpulse of custom,\" i.e. carnal concupiscence, \"is broken, and being \nsuppressed is gradually weakened: for it was stronger when we followed \nit, and though not wholly destroyed, it is certainly less strong when we \ncurb it.\" Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 12) that \"as a child \nought to live according to the direction of his tutor, so ought the \nconcupiscible to accord with reason.\"",

Secondly, a desire may be called \nnatural with regard to the species of the thing that nature requires for \nits own preservation; and in this way it does not happen often that one \nsins in the matter of natural desires, for nature requires only that \nwhich supplies its need, and there is no sin in desiring this, save only \nwhere it is desired in excess as to quantity. This is the only way in \nwhich sin can occur with regard to natural desires, according to the \nPhilosopher (Ethic. iii, 11).\nThere are other things in respect of which sins frequently occur, and \nthese are certain incentives to desire devised by human curiosity [*Cf. \nQuestion [167]], such as the nice [curiosa] preparation of food, or the adornment \nof women.

Therefore \ncowardice is a greater vice than intemperance.",

Therefore cowardice is a more grievous sin than \nintemperance.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 12) that \n\"intemperance seems more akin to voluntary action than cowardice.\" \nTherefore it is more sinful.",
        "ANS": "one may be compared with another in two ways. First, with \nregard to the matter or object; secondly, on the part of the man who \nsins: and in both ways intemperance is a more  grievous sin than \ncowardice.\nFirst, as regards the matter. For cowardice shuns dangers of death, to \navoid which the principal motive is the necessity of preserving life. On \nthe other hand, intemperance is about pleasures, the desire of which is \nnot so necessary for the preservation of life, because, as stated above \n(Article [2], ad 2), intemperance is more about certain annexed pleasures or \ndesires than about natural desires or pleasures. Now the more necessary \nthe motive of sin the less grievous the sin. Wherefore intemperance is a \nmore grievous vice than cowardice, on the part of the object or motive \nmatter.\nIn like manner again, on the part of the man who sins, and this for \nthree reasons. First, because the more sound-minded a man is, the more \ngrievous his sin, wherefore sins are not imputed to those who are \ndemented. Now grave fear and sorrow, especially in dangers of death, stun \nthe human mind, but not so pleasure which is the motive of intemperance. \nSecondly, because the more voluntary a sin the graver it is. Now \nintemperance has more of the voluntary in it than cowardice has, and this \nfor two reasons. The first is because actions done through fear have \ntheir origin in the compulsion of an external agent, so that they are not \nsimply voluntary but mixed, as stated in Ethic. iii, 1, whereas actions \ndone for the sake of pleasure are simply voluntary. The second reason is \nbecause the actions of an intemperate man are more voluntary individually \nand less voluntary generically. For no one would wish to be intemperate, \nyet man is enticed by individual pleasures which make of him an \nintemperate man. Hence the most effective remedy against intemperance is \nnot to dwell on the consideration of singulars. It is the other way about \nin matters relating to cowardice: because the particular action that \nimposes itself on a man is less voluntary, for instance to cast aside his \nshield, and the like, whereas the general purpose is more voluntary, for \ninstance to save himself by flight. Now that which is more voluntary in \nthe particular circumstances in which the act takes place, is simply more \nvoluntary. Wherefore intemperance, being simply more voluntary than \ncowardice, is a greater vice. Thirdly, because it is easier to find a \nremedy for intemperance than for cowardice, since pleasures of food and \nsex, which are the matter of intemperance, are of everyday occurrence, \nand it is possible for man without danger by frequent practice in their \nregard to become temperate; whereas dangers of death are of rare \noccurrence, and it is more dangerous for man to encounter them frequently \nin order to cease being a coward.",
        "RP1": "The excellence of fortitude in comparison with temperance \nmay be considered from two standpoints. First, with regard to the end, \nwhich has the aspect of good: because fortitude is directed to the common \ngood more than temperance is. And from this point of view cowardice has a \ncertain precedence over intemperance, since by cowardice some people \nforsake the defense of the common good. Secondly, with regard to the \ndifficulty, because it is more difficult to endure dangers of death than \nto refrain  from any pleasures whatever: and from this point of view \nthere is no need for cowardice to take precedence of intemperance. For \njust as it is a greater strength that does not succumb to a stronger \nforce, so on the other hand to be overcome by a stronger force is proof \nof a lesser vice, and to succumb to a weaker force, is the proof of a \ngreater vice.",
        "RP2": "Love of self-preservation, for the sake of which one shuns \nperils of death, is much more connatural than any pleasures whatever of \nfood and sex which are directed to the preservation of life. Hence it is \nmore difficult to overcome the fear of dangers of death, than the desire \nof pleasure in matters of food and sex: although the latter is more \ndifficult to resist than anger, sorrow, and fear, occasioned by certain \nother evils.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (Questions [48],128), a cardinal virtue may have \nthree kinds of parts, namely integral, subjective, and potential. The \nintegral parts of a virtue are the conditions the concurrence of which \nare necessary for virtue: and in this respect there are two integral \nparts of temperance, \"shamefacedness,\" whereby one recoils from the \ndisgrace that is contrary to temperance, and \"honesty,\" whereby one loves \nthe beauty of temperance. For, as stated above (Question [141], Article [2], ad 3), \ntemperance more than any other virtue lays claim to a certain comeliness, \nand the vices of intemperance excel others in disgrace.\nThe subjective parts of a virtue are its species: and the species of a \nvirtue have to be differentiated according to the difference of matter or \nobject. Now temperance is about pleasures of touch, which are of two \nkinds. For some are directed to nourishment: and in these as regards \nmeat, there is \"abstinence,\" and as regards drink properly there is \n\"sobriety.\" Other pleasures are directed to the power of procreation, and \nin these as regards the principal pleasure of the act itself of \nprocreation, there is \"chastity,\" and as to the pleasures incidental to \nthe act, resulting, for instance, from kissing, touching, or fondling, we \nhave \"purity.\"\nThe potential parts of a principal virtue are called secondary virtues: \nfor while the principal virtue observes the mode in some principal \nmatter, these observe the mode in some other matter wherein moderation is \nnot so difficult. Now it belongs to temperance to moderate pleasures of \ntouch, which are most difficult to moderate. Wherefore any virtue that is \neffective of moderation in some matter or other, and restrains the \nappetite in its impulse towards something, may be reckoned a part of \ntemperance, as a virtue annexed thereto.\nThis happens in three ways: first, in the inward movements of the soul; \nsecondly, in the outward movements and actions of the body; thirdly, in \noutward things. Now besides the movement of concupiscence, which \ntemperance moderates and restrains, we find in the soul three movements \ntowards a particular object. In the first place there is the movement of \nthe will when stirred by the impulse of passion: and this movement is \nrestrained by \"continence,\" the effect of which is that, although a man \nsuffer immoderate concupiscences, his will does not succumb to them. \nAnother inward movement towards something is the movement of hope, and of \nthe resultant daring, and this is moderated or restrained by \"humility.\" \nThe third movement is that of anger, which tends  towards revenge, and \nthis is restrained by \"meekness\" or \"mildness.\"\nWith regard to bodily movements and actions, moderation and restraint is \nthe effect of \"modesty,\" which, according to Andronicus, has three parts. \nThe first of these enables one to discern what to do and what not to do, \nand to observe the right order, and to persevere in what we do: this he \nassigns to \"method.\" The second is that a man observe decorum in what he \ndoes, and this he ascribes to \"refinement.\" The third has to do with the \nconversation or any other intercourse between a man and his friends, and \nthis is called \"gravity.\"\nWith regard to external things, a twofold moderation has to be observed. \nFirst, we must not desire too many, and to this Macrobius assigns \n\"lowliness,\" and Andronicus \"contentment\"; secondly, we must not be too \nnice in our requirements, and to this Macrobius ascribes \"moderation,\" \nAndronicus \"simplicity.\"",

And since this reproach has the character of \nan arduous evil, just as honor has the character of an arduous good, \nshamefacedness, which is fear of disgrace, regards first and foremost \nreproach or ignominy.

Thirdly, in \norder to satisfy for sins: wherefore it is written (Joel 2:12): \"Be \nconverted to Me with all your heart, in fasting and in weeping and in \nmourning.\" The same is declared by Augustine in a sermon (De orat. et \nJejun.

Yet \nreason does not retrench so much from one's food as to refuse nature its \nnecessary support: thus Jerome says:* \"It matters not whether thou art a \nlong or a short time in destroying thyself, since to afflict the body \nimmoderately, whether by excessive lack of nourishment, or by eating or \nsleeping too little, is to offer a sacrifice of stolen goods.\" [*The \nquotation is from the Corpus of Canon Law (Cap.

Wherefore fasting ought to be appointed specially for those \ntimes, when it behooves man to be cleansed from sin, and the minds of the \nfaithful to be raised to God by devotion: and these things are \nparticularly requisite before the feast of Easter, when sins are loosed \nby baptism, which is solemnly conferred on Easter-eve, on which day our \nLord's burial is commemorated, because \"we are buried together with \nChrist by baptism unto death\" (Rm. 6:4). Moreover at the Easter festival \nthe mind of man ought to be devoutly raised to the glory of eternity, \nwhich Christ restored by rising from the dead, and so the Church ordered \na fast to be observed immediately before the Paschal feast; and for the \nsame reason, on the eve of the chief festivals, because it is then that \none ought to make ready to keep the coming feast devoutly. Again it is \nthe custom in the Church for Holy orders to be conferred every quarter of \nthe year (in sign whereof our Lord fed four thousand men with seven \nloaves, which signify the New Testament year as Jerome says [*Comment. in \nMarc. viii]): and then both the ordainer, and the candidates for \nordination, and even the whole people, for whose good they are ordained, \nneed to fast in order to make themselves ready for the ordination. Hence \nit is related (Lk. 6:12) that before choosing His disciples our Lord \n\"went out into a mountain to pray\": and Ambrose [*Exposit. in Luc.] \ncommenting on these words says: \"What shouldst thou do, when thou \ndesirest to undertake some pious work, since Christ prayed before sending \nHis apostles?\"\nWith regard to the forty day's fast, according to Gregory (Hom. xvi in \nEvang.) there are three reasons for the number. First, \"because the power \nof the Decalogue is accomplished in the four books of the Holy Gospels: \nsince forty is the product of ten multiplied by four.\" Or \"because we are \ncomposed of four elements in this mortal body through whose lusts we \ntransgress the Lord's commandments which are delivered to us in the \nDecalogue. Wherefore it is fitting we should punish that same body forty \ntimes. or, because, just as under the Law it was commanded that tithes \nshould be paid of things, so we strive to pay God a tithe of days, for \nsince a year is composed of three hundred and sixty-six days, by \npunishing ourselves for thirty-six days\" (namely, the fasting days during \nthe six weeks of Lent) \"we pay God a tithe of our year.\" According to \nAugustine (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 16) a fourth reason may be added. For \nthe Creator is the \"Trinity,\" Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: while the \nnumber \"three\" refers to the invisible creature, since we are commanded \nto love God, with our whole heart, with our whole soul, and with our \nwhole mind: and the number \"four\" refers to the visible creature, by \nreason of heat, cold, wet and dry. Thus the number \"ten\" [*Ten is the sum \nof three, three, and  four] signifies all things, and if this be \nmultiplied by four which refers to the body whereby we make use of \nthings, we have the number forty.\nEach fast of the Ember days is composed of three days, on account of the \nnumber of months in each season: or on account of the number of Holy \norders which are conferred at these times.",

Wherefore those vices \nare reckoned among the daughters of gluttony, which are the results of \neating and drinking immoderately. These may be accounted for either on \nthe part of the soul or on the part of the body. on the part of the soul \nthese results are of four kinds. First, as regards the reason, whose \nkeenness is dulled by immoderate meat and drink, and in this respect we \nreckon as a daughter of gluttony, \"dullness of sense in the \nunderstanding,\" on account of the fumes of food disturbing the brain. \nEven so, on the other hand, abstinence conduces to the penetrating power \nof wisdom, according to Eccles. 2:3, \"I thought in my heart to withdraw \nmy flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind in wisdom.\" Secondly, as \nregards the. appetite, which is disordered in many ways by immoderation \nin eating and drinking, as though reason were fast asleep at the helm, \nand in this respect \"unseemly joy\" is reckoned, because all the other \ninordinate passions are directed to joy or sorrow, as stated in Ethic. \nii, 5. To this we must refer the saying of 3 Esdra 3:20, that \"wine . . . \ngives every one a confident and joyful mind.\" Thirdly, as regards \ninordinate words, and thus we have \"loquaciousness,\" because as Gregory \nsays (Pastor. iii, 19), \"unless gluttons were carried away by immoderate \nspeech, that rich man who is stated to have feasted sumptuously every day \nwould not have been so tortured in his tongue.\" Fourthly, as regards \ninordinate action, and in this way we have \"scurrility,\" i.e. a kind of \nlevity resulting from lack of reason, which is unable not only to bridle \nthe speech, but also to restrain outward behavior. Hence a gloss on Eph. \n5:4, \"Or foolish talking or scurrility,\" says that \"fools call this \ngeniality---i.e. jocularity, because it is wont to raise a laugh.\" Both \nof these, however, may be referred to the words which may happen to be \nsinful, either by reason of excess which belongs to \"loquaciousness,\" or \nby reason of unbecomingness, which belongs to \"scurrility.\"\nOn the part of the body, mention is made of \"uncleanness,\" which may \nrefer either to the inordinate emission of any kind of  superfluities, or \nespecially to the emission of the semen. Hence a gloss on Eph. 5:3, \"But \nfornication and all uncleanness,\" says: \"That is, any kind of \nincontinence that has reference to lust.\"",

It \nis also refuted by reason, both because a Divine good takes precedence of \na human good, and because the good of the soul is preferable to the good \nof the body, and again because the good of the contemplative life is \nbetter than that of the active life. Now virginity is directed to the \ngood of the soul in respect of the contemplative life, which consists in \nthinking \"on the things of God\" [Vulg.: 'the Lord'], whereas marriage is \ndirected to the good of the body, namely the bodily increase of the human \nrace, and belongs to the active life, since the man and woman who embrace \nthe married life have to think \"on the things of the world,\" as the \nApostle says (1 Cor. 7:34).

First, on the \npart of chastity itself; if to wit, the married person is more prepared \nin mind to observe virginity, if it should be expedient, than the one who \nis actually a virgin. Hence Augustine (De Bono Conjug. xxii) charges the \nvirgin to say: \"I am no better than Abraham, although the chastity of \ncelibacy is better than the chastity of marriage.\" Further on he gives \nthe reason for this: \"For what I do now, he would have done better, if it \nwere fitting for him to do it then; and what they did I would even do now \nif it behooved me now to do it.\" Secondly, because perhaps the person who \nis not a virgin has some more excellent virtue. Wherefore Augustine says \n(De Virgin. xliv): \"Whence does a virgin know the things that belong to \nthe Lord, however solicitous she be about them, if perchance on account \nof some mental fault she be not yet ripe for martyrdom, whereas this \nwoman to whom she delighted in preferring herself is already able to \ndrink the chalice of the Lord?\"",

Consequently the higher powers, namely the reason and the \nwill, are most grievously disordered by lust.\nNow the reason has four acts in matters of action.

In order to make this evident, \nwe must take note that every sin committed directly against human life is \na mortal  sin. Now simple fornication implies an inordinateness that \ntends to injure the life of the offspring to be born of this union. For \nwe find in all animals where the upbringing of the offspring needs care \nof both male and female, that these come together not indeterminately, \nbut the male with a certain female, whether one or several; such is the \ncase with all birds: while, on the other hand, among those animals, where \nthe female alone suffices for the offspring's upbringing, the union is \nindeterminate, as in the case of dogs and like animals. Now it is evident \nthat the upbringing of a human child requires not only the mother's care \nfor his nourishment, but much more the care of his father as guide and \nguardian, and under whom he progresses in goods both internal and \nexternal. Hence human nature rebels against an indeterminate union of the \nsexes and demands that a man should be united to a determinate woman and \nshould abide with her a long time or even for a whole lifetime. Hence it \nis that in the human race the male has a natural solicitude for the \ncertainty of offspring, because on him devolves the upbringing of the \nchild: and this certainly would cease if the union of sexes were \nindeterminate.\nThis union with a certain definite woman is called matrimony; which for \nthe above reason is said to belong to the natural law. Since, however, \nthe union of the sexes is directed to the common good of the whole human \nrace, and common goods depend on the law for their determination, as \nstated above (FS, Question [90], Article [2]), it follows that this union of man and \nwoman, which is called matrimony, is determined by some law. What this \ndetermination is for us will be stated in the Third Part of this work \n(XP, Question [50], seqq.), where we shall treat of the sacrament of matrimony. \nWherefore, since fornication is an indeterminate union of the sexes, as \nsomething incompatible with matrimony, it is opposed to the good of the \nchild's upbringing, and consequently it is a mortal sin.\nNor does it matter if a man having knowledge of a woman by fornication, \nmake sufficient provision for the upbringing of the child: because a \nmatter that comes under the determination of the law is judged according \nto what happens in general, and not according to what may happen in a \nparticular case.",

For among the \nGentiles, fornication was not deemed unlawful, on account of the \ncorruption of natural reason: whereas the Jews, taught by the Divine law, \nconsidered it to be unlawful. The other things mentioned were loathsome \nto the Jews through custom introduced by the law into their daily life. \nHence the Apostles forbade these things to the Gentiles, not as though \nthey were unlawful in themselves, but because they were loathsome to the \nJews, as stated above (FS, Question [103], Article [4], ad 3).",

Therefore \njust as Abraham did not sin in being willing to slay his innocent son, \nbecause he obeyed God, although considered in itself it was contrary to \nright human reason in general, so, too, Osee sinned not in committing \nfornication by God's command. Nor should such a copulation be strictly \ncalled fornication, though it be so called in reference to the general \ncourse of things.

For the thought which preceded while he was awake, is \nsometimes purely speculative, for instance  when one thinks about the \nsins of the flesh for the purpose of discussion; while sometimes it is \naccompanied by a certain emotion either of concupiscence or of \nabhorrence. Now nocturnal pollution is more apt to arise from thinking \nabout carnal sins with concupiscence for such pleasures, because this \nleaves its trace and inclination in the soul, so that the sleeper is more \neasily led in his imagination to consent to acts productive of pollution. \nIn this sense the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that \"in so far as \ncertain movements in some degree pass\" from the waking state to the state \nof sleep, \"the dreams of good men are better than those of any other \npeople\": and Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15) that \"even during \nsleep, the soul may have conspicuous merit on account of its good \ndisposition.\" Thus it is evident that nocturnal pollution may be sinful \non the part of its cause. on the other hand, it may happen that nocturnal \npollution ensues after thoughts about carnal acts, though they were \nspeculative, or accompanied by abhorrence, and then it is not sinful, \nneither in itself nor in its cause.\nThe third cause is spiritual and external; for instance when by the work \nof a devil the sleeper's phantasms are disturbed so as to induce the \naforesaid result. Sometimes this is associated with a previous sin, \nnamely the neglect to guard against the wiles of the devil. Hence the \nwords of the hymn at even: \"Our enemy repress, that so our bodies no \nuncleanness know\" [*Translation W. K. Blount].\nOn the other hand, this may occur without any fault on man's part, and \nthrough the wickedness of the devil alone. Thus we read in the \nCollationes Patrum (Coll. xxii, 6) of a man who was ever wont to suffer \nfrom nocturnal pollution on festivals, and that the devil brought this \nabout in order to prevent him from receiving Holy Communion. Hence it is \nmanifest that nocturnal pollution is never a sin, but is sometimes the \nresult of a previous sin.",

In fact a twofold \ninjustice attaches to it. One is on the part of the virgin, who, though \nnot violated by force, is nevertheless seduced, and thus the seducer is \nbound to compensation. Hence it is written (Ex. 22:16,17): \"If a man \nseduce a virgin not yet espoused, and lie with her, he shall endow her \nand have her to wife. If the maid's father will not give her to him, he \nshall give money according to the dowry, which virgins are wont to \nreceive.\" The other injury is done to the maid's father: wherefore the \nseducer is bound by the Law to a penalty in his regard. For it is written \n(Dt. 22:28,29): \"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not \nespoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment: \nhe that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sicles of \nsilver, and shall have her to wife, and because he hath humbled her, he \nmay not put her away all the days of his life\": and this, lest he should \nprove to have married her in mockery, as Augustine observes.

Now sexual intercourse with women related \nby consanguinity or affinity is unbecoming to venereal union on three \ncounts. First, because man naturally owes a certain respect to his \nparents and therefore to his other blood relations, who are descended in \nnear degree from the same parents: so much so indeed that among the \nancients, as Valerius Maximus relates [*Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1], it was \nnot deemed right for a son to bathe with his father, lest they should  \nsee one another naked. Now from what has been said (Question [142], Article [4]: Question [151], Article [4]), it is evident that in venereal acts there is a certain \nshamefulness inconsistent with respect, wherefore men are ashamed of \nthem. Wherefore it is unseemly that such persons should be united in \nvenereal intercourse. This reason seems to be indicated (Lev. 18:7) where \nwe read: \"She is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness,\" and \nthe same is expressed further on with regard to others.\nThe second reason is because blood relations must needs live in close \ntouch with one another. Wherefore if they were not debarred from venereal \nunion, opportunities of venereal intercourse would be very frequent and \nthus men's minds would be enervated by lust. Hence in the Old Law [*Lev. \n18] the prohibition was apparently directed specially to those persons \nwho must needs live together.\nThe third reason is, because this would hinder a man from having many \nfriends: since through a man taking a stranger to wife, all his wife's \nrelations are united to him by a special kind of friendship, as though \nthey were of the same blood as himself. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. \nDei xv, 16): \"The demands of charity are most perfectly satisfied by men \nuniting together in the bonds that the various ties of friendship \nrequire, so that they may live together in a useful and becoming amity; \nnor should one man have many relationships in one, but each should have \none.\"\nAristotle adds another reason (2 Polit. ii): for since it is natural \nthat a man should have a liking for a woman of his kindred, if to this be \nadded the love that has its origin in venereal intercourse, his love \nwould be too ardent and would become a very great incentive to lust: and \nthis is contrary to chastity.

Hence the Philosopher instances a horse (De Animal. ix, \n47) which covered its own mother by mistake and threw itself over a \nprecipice as though horrified at what it had done, because some animals \neven have a natural respect for  those that have begotten them. There is \nnot the same essential unbecomingness attaching to other persons who are \nrelated to one another not directly but through their parents: and, as to \nthis, becomingness or unbecomingness varies according to custom, and \nhuman or Divine law: because, as stated above (Article [2]), sexual intercourse, \nbeing directed to the common good, is subject to law.

This may be observed both in speculative and \nin practical matters. Wherefore just as in speculative matters the most \ngrievous and shameful error is that which is about things the knowledge \nof which is naturally bestowed on man, so in matters of action it is most \ngrave and shameful to act against things as determined by nature. \nTherefore, since by the unnatural vices man transgresses that which has \nbeen determined by nature with regard to the use of venereal actions, it \nfollows that in this matter this sin is gravest of all. After it comes \nincest, which, as stated above (Article [9]), is contrary to the natural respect \nwhich we owe persons related to us.\nWith regard to the other species of lust they imply a transgression \nmerely of that which is determined by right reason, on the \npresupposition, however, of natural principles. Now it is more against \nreason to make use of the venereal act not only with prejudice to the \nfuture offspring, but also so as to injure another person besides. \nWherefore simple fornication, which is committed without injustice to \nanother person, is the least grave among the species of lust. Then, it is \na greater injustice to have intercourse with a woman who is subject to \nanother's authority as regards the act of generation, than as regards \nmerely her guardianship. Wherefore adultery is more grievous than \nseduction. And both of these are aggravated by the use of violence. Hence \nrape of a virgin is graver than seduction, and rape of a wife than \nadultery.

Wherefore the same applies to continence \nunderstood thus, as to virginity which we have stated above (Question [152], Article [3]) to be a virtue. Others, however, understand continence as signifying \nthat whereby a man resists evil desires, which in him are vehement. In \nthis sense the Philosopher takes continence (Ethic. vii, 7), and thus \nalso it is used in the Conferences of the Fathers (Collat. xii, 10,11). \nIn this way continence has something of the nature of a virtue, in so \nfar, to wit, as the reason stands firm in opposition to the passions, \nlest it be led astray by them: yet it does not attain to the perfect \nnature of a moral virtue, by which even the sensitive appetite is subject \nto reason so that vehement passions contrary to reason do not arise in \nthe sensitive appetite. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 9) that \n\"continence is not a virtue but a mixture,\" inasmuch as it has something \nof virtue, and somewhat falls short of virtue.\nIf, however, we take virtue in a broad sense, for any principle of \ncommendable actions, we may say that continence is a virtue.",

Yet these passions, \nhowever vehement they be, are not the sufficient cause of incontinence, \nbut are merely the occasion thereof, since, so long as the use of reason \nremains, man is always able to resist his passions. If, however, the \npassions gain such strength as to take away the use of reason \naltogether---as in the case of those who become insane through the \nvehemence of their passions---the essential conditions of continence or \nincontinence cease, because such people do not retain the judgment of \nreason, which the continent man follows and the incontinent forsakes. \nFrom this it follows that the direct cause of incontinence is on the part \nof the soul, which fails to resist a passion by the reason. This happens \nin two ways, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 7): first, when \nthe soul yields to the passions, before the reason has given its counsel; \nand this is called \"unbridled incontinence\" or \"impetuosity\": secondly, \nwhen a man does not stand to what has been counselled, through holding \nweakly to reason's judgment; wherefore this kind of incontinence is \ncalled \"weakness.\" Hence it is manifest that incontinence pertains \nchiefly to the soul.",

In this way incontinence is a sin for two reasons: first, because the \nincontinent man goes astray from that which is  in accord with reason; \nsecondly, because he plunges into shameful pleasures. Hence the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. vii, 4) that \"incontinence is censurable not \nonly because it is wrong\"---that is, by straying from reason---\"but also \nbecause it is wicked\"---that is, by following evil desires. Secondly, \nincontinence about a matter is considered, properly---inasmuch as it is a \nstraying from reason---but not simply; for instance when a man does not \nobserve the mode of reason in his desire for honor, riches, and so forth, \nwhich seem to be good in themselves. About such things there is \nincontinence, not simply but relatively, even as we have said above in \nreference to continence (Question [155], Article [2], ad 3). In this way incontinence is \na sin, not from the fact that one gives way to wicked desires, but \nbecause one fails to observe the mode of reason even in the desire for \nthings that are of themselves desirable.\nThirdly, incontinence is said to be about a matter, not properly, but \nmetaphorically. for instance about the desires for things of which one \ncannot make an evil use, such as the desire for virtue. A man may be said \nto be incontinent in these matters metaphorically, because just as the \nincontinent man is entirely led by his evil desire, even so is a man \nentirely led by his good desire which is in accord with reason.

Now in the intemperate man, the \nwill is inclined to sin in virtue of its own choice, which proceeds from \na habit acquired through custom: whereas in the incontinent man, the will \nis inclined to sin through a passion. And since passion soon passes, \nwhereas a habit is \"a disposition difficult to remove,\" the result is \nthat the incontinent man repents at once, as soon as the passion has \npassed; but not so the intemperate man; in fact he rejoices in having \nsinned, because the sinful act has become connatural to him by reason of \nhis habit. Wherefore in reference to such persons it is written (Prov. 2:14) that \"they are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most \nwicked things.\" Hence it follows that \"the intemperate man is much worse \nthan the incontinent,\" as also the Philosopher declares (Ethic. vii, 7).",

Now in both \nthe incontinent and the intemperate man,  ignorance arises from the \nappetite being inclined to something, either by passion, as in the \nincontinent, or by habit, as in the intemperate.

For the \nignorance of the incontinent man regards some particular detail of choice \n(in so far as he deems that he must choose this particular thing now): \nwhereas the intemperate man's ignorance is about the end itself, inasmuch \nas he judges this thing good, in order that he may follow his desires \nwithout being curbed. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7,8) that \n\"the incontinent man is better than the intemperate, because he retains \nthe best principle [*{To beltiston, e arche}, 'the best thing, i.e. the \nprinciple'],\" to wit, the right estimate of the end.",

There are four reasons for this, and the Philosopher indicates \nthem, Ethic. vii, 6: First, because the movement of anger partakes \nsomewhat of reason, since the angry man tends to avenge the injury done \nto him, and reason dictates this in a certain degree. Yet he does not \ntend thereto perfectly, because he does not intend the due mode of \nvengeance. on the other hand, the movement of desire is altogether in \naccord with sense and nowise in accord with reason. Secondly, because the \nmovement of anger results more from the bodily temperament owing to the \nquickness of the movement of the bile which tends to anger. Hence one who \nby bodily temperament is disposed to anger is more readily angry than one \nwho is disposed to concupiscence is liable to be concupiscent: wherefore \nalso it happens more often that the children of those who are disposed to \nanger are themselves disposed to anger, than that the children of those \nwho are disposed to concupiscence are also disposed to concupiscence. Now \nthat which results from the natural disposition of the body is deemed \nmore deserving of pardon. Thirdly, because anger seeks to work openly, \nwhereas concupiscence is fain to disguise itself and creeps in by \nstealth. Fourthly, because he who is subject to concupiscence works  with \npleasure, whereas the angry man works as though forced by a certain \nprevious displeasure.\nSecondly, the sin of incontinence may be considered with regard to the \nevil into which one falls through forsaking reason; and thus incontinence \nof anger is, for the most part, more grievous, because it leads to things \nthat are harmful to one's neighbor.",

This applies to the case in point; \nbecause through the passion of anger a man is provoked to inflict a too \nsevere punishment, while it belongs directly to clemency to mitigate \npunishment, and this might be prevented by excessive anger.\nConsequently meekness, in so far as it restrains the onslaught of anger, \nconcurs with clemency towards the same effect; yet they differ from one \nanother, inasmuch as clemency moderates external punishment, while \nmeekness properly mitigates the passion of anger.",

Hence our \nLord, in order to remove an obstacle to our spiritual welfare, showed by \ngiving an example of humility, that outward exaltation is to be despised. \nThus humility is, as it were, a disposition to man's untrammeled access \nto spiritual and divine goods.

Secondly, it may be considered as having a certain \ninfluence towards other sins. In this way it has somewhat of a generic \ncharacter, inasmuch as all sins may arise from pride, in two ways. First \ndirectly, through other sins being directed to the end of pride which is \none's own excellence, to which may be directed anything that is \ninordinately desired. Secondly, indirectly and accidentally as it were, \nthat is by removing an obstacle, since pride makes a man despise the \nDivine law which hinders him from sinning, according to Jer. 2:20, \"Thou \nhast broken My yoke, thou hast burst My bands, and thou saidst: I will \nnot serve.\"\nIt must, however, be observed that this generic character of pride \nadmits of the possibility of all vices arising from pride sometimes, but \nit does not imply that all vices originate from pride always. For though \none may break the commandments of the Law by any kind of sin, through \ncontempt which pertains to pride, yet one does not always break the \nDivine commandments through contempt, but sometimes through ignorance. \nand sometimes through weakness: and for this reason Augustine says (De \nNat. et Grat. xxix) that \"many things are done amiss which are not done \nthrough pride.\"",
        "RP1": "These words are introduced by Augustine into his book De \nNat. et Grat., not as being his own, but as those of someone with whom he \nis arguing.

We might, however, reply that \nthese authorities must be understood as referring to the outward effect \nof pride, namely the breaking of the commandments, which applies to every \nsin, and not to the inward act of pride, namely contempt of the \ncommandment. For sin is committed, not always through contempt, but \nsometimes through ignorance, sometimes through weakness, as stated above.",
        "RP2": "A man may sometimes commit a sin effectively, but not \naffectively; thus he who, in ignorance, slays his father, is a parricide \neffectively, but not affectively, since he did not intend it.

        "RP3": "A sin may destroy a virtue in two ways. In one way by \ndirect contrariety to a virtue, and thus pride does not corrupt every \nvirtue, but only humility; even as every special sin destroys the special \nvirtue opposed to it, by acting counter thereto. In another way a sin \ndestroys a virtue, by making ill use of that virtue: and thus pride \ndestroys every virtue, in so far as  it finds an occasion of pride in \nevery virtue, just as in everything else pertaining to excellence. Hence \nit does not follow that it is a general sin.",

Now the \nproper object of pride is something difficult, for pride is the desire of \none's own excellence, as stated above (Articles [1],2). Wherefore pride must \nneeds pertain in some way to the irascible faculty. Now the irascible may \nbe taken in two ways. First in a strict sense, and thus it is a part of \nthe sensitive appetite, even as anger, strictly speaking, is a passion of \nthe sensitive appetite. Secondly, the irascible may be taken in a broader \nsense, so as to belong also to the intellective appetite,  to which also \nanger is sometimes ascribed. It is thus that we attribute anger to God \nand the angels, not as a passion, but as denoting the sentence of justice \npronouncing judgment. Nevertheless the irascible understood in this broad \nsense is not distinct from the concupiscible power, as stated above in \nthe FP, Question [59], Article [4]; FS, Question [82], Article [5], ad 1 and 2.\nConsequently if the difficult thing which is the object of pride, were \nmerely some sensible object, whereto the sensitive appetite might tend, \npride would have to be in the irascible which is part of the sensitive \nappetite. But since the difficult thing which pride has in view is common \nboth to sensible and to spiritual things, we must needs say that the \nsubject of pride is the irascible not only strictly so called, as a part \nof the sensitive appetite, but also in its wider acceptation, as \napplicable to the intellective appetite.

Consequently whatsoever things lead a man to inordinate \nself-esteem lead him to pride: and one of those is the observing of other \npeople's failings, just as, on the other hand, in the words of Gregory \n(Moral. xxiii, 17), \"holy men, by a like observation of other people's \nvirtues, set others above themselves.\" Accordingly the conclusion is not \nthat pride is in the rational faculty, but that one of its causes is in \nthe reason.",

Now it must be observed that all excellence results \nfrom a good possessed. Such a good may be considered in three ways. \nFirst, in itself. For it is evident that the greater the good that one \nhas, the greater the excellence that one derives from it. Hence when a \nman ascribes to himself a good greater than what he has, it follows that \nhis appetite tends to his own excellence in a measure exceeding his \ncompetency: and thus we have the third species of pride, namely \"boasting \nof having what one has not.\"\nSecondly, it may be considered with regard to its cause, in so far as to \nhave a thing of oneself is more excellent than to have it of another. \nHence when a man esteems the good he has received of another as though he \nhad it of himself, the result is that his appetite is borne towards his \nown excellence immoderately. Now one is cause of one's own good in two \nways, efficiently and meritoriously: and thus we have the first two \nspecies of pride, namely \"when a man thinks he has from himself that \nwhich he has from God,\" or \"when he believes that which he has received \nfrom above to be due to his own merits.\"\nThirdly, it may be considered with regard to the manner of having it, in \nso far as a man obtains greater excellence through possessing some good \nmore excellently than other men; the result again being that his appetite \nis borne inordinately towards his own excellence: and thus we have the \nfourth species of pride, which is \"when a man despises others and wishes \nto be singularly conspicuous.\"",

Thus a man who commits fornication, judges that for the \ntime being it is good for him to commit fornication; yet he is not an \nunbeliever, as he would be, were he to say that universally fornication \nis good. It is thus in the question in point: for it pertains to unbelief \nto assert universally that there is a good which is not from God, or that \ngrace is given to men for their merits, whereas, properly speaking, it \nbelongs to pride and not to unbelief, through inordinate desire of one's \nown excellence, to boast of one's goods as though one had them of \noneself, or of one's own merits.",

The second degree of \nhumility is \"to speak few and sensible words, and not to be loud of \nvoice\": to this is opposed \"frivolity of mind,\" by which a man is proud \nof speech.

The sixth degree of humility is \"to believe and acknowledge \noneself viler than all,\" to which is opposed \"arrogance,\" whereby a man \nsets himself above others. The seventh degree of humility is \"to think \noneself worthless and unprofitable for all purposes,\" to which is opposed \n\"presumption,\" whereby a man thinks himself capable of things that are \nabove him. The eighth degree of humility is \"to confess one's sins,\" to \nwhich is opposed \"defense of one's sins.\" The ninth degree is \"to embrace \npatience by obeying under difficult and contrary circumstances,\" to which \nis opposed \"deceitful confession,\" whereby a man being unwilling to be \npunished for his sins confesses them deceitfully.

Now \non the part of the conversion, there is no reason for pride being the \ngreatest of sins, because uplifting which pride covets inordinately, is \nnot essentially most incompatible with the good of virtue. But on the \npart of the aversion, pride has extreme gravity, because in other sins \nman turns away from God, either through ignorance or through weakness, or \nthrough desire for any other good whatever; whereas pride denotes \naversion from God simply through being unwilling to be subject to God and \nHis rule. Hence Boethius [*Cf. Cassian, de Caenob. Inst. xii, 7] says \nthat \"while all vices flee from God, pride alone withstands God\"; for \nwhich reason it is specially stated (James 4:6) that \"God resisteth the \nproud.\" Wherefore aversion from God and His commandments, which is a \nconsequence as it were in other sins, belongs to pride by its very \nnature, for its act is the contempt of God. And since that which belongs \nto a thing by its nature is always of greater weight than that which \nbelongs to it through something else, it follows that pride is the most  \ngrievous of sins by its genus, because it exceeds in aversion which is \nthe formal complement of sin.",

A difficulty of this kind in avoiding sin diminishes the gravity of \nthe sin; because a man sins the more grievously, according as he yields \nto a less impetuous temptation, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, \n12,15).\nSecondly, it is difficult to avoid a sin, on account of its being \nhidden.

Hence Isidore says (De Summo Bono \nii, 38) that \"pride is the worst of all vices; whether because it is \nappropriate to those who are of highest and foremost rank, or because it \noriginates from just and virtuous deeds, so that its guilt is less \nperceptible. on the other hand, carnal lust is apparent to all, because \nfrom the outset it is of a shameful nature: and yet, under God's \ndispensation, it is less grievous than pride.

For Dionysius says (Div.

Now spiritual good, in so far as the rational \ncreature participates in the Divine likeness, may be considered in \nreference to three things. First, as to natural being: and this likeness \nwas imprinted from the very outset of their creation, both on man---of \nwhom it is written (Gn. 1:26) that God made man \"to His image and \nlikeness\"---and on the angel, of whom it is written (Ezech. 28:12): \"Thou \nwast the seal of resemblance.\" Secondly, as to knowledge: and this \nlikeness was bestowed on the angel at his creation, wherefore immediately \nafter the words just quoted, \"Thou wast the seal of resemblance,\" we \nread: \"Full of wisdom.\" But the first man, at his creation, had not yet \nreceived this likeness actually but only in potentiality. Thirdly, as to \nthe power of operation: and neither angel nor man received this likeness \nactually at the very outset of his creation, because to each there \nremained something to be done whereby to obtain happiness.\nAccordingly, while both (namely the devil and the first man) coveted \nGod's likeness inordinately, neither of them sinned by coveting a \nlikeness of nature. But the first man sinned chiefly by coveting God's \nlikeness as regards \"knowledge of good and evil,\" according to the \nserpent's instigation, namely that by his own natural power he might \ndecide what was good, and what was evil for him to do; or again that he \nshould of himself foreknow what good and what evil would befall him. \nSecondarily he sinned by coveting God's likeness as regards his own power \nof operation, namely that by his own natural power he might act so as to \nobtain happiness. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that \"the \nwoman's mind was filled with love of her own power.\" On the other hand, \nthe devil sinned by coveting God's likeness, as regards power. Wherefore \nAugustine says (De Vera Relig. 13) that \"he wished to enjoy his own power \nrather than God's.\" Nevertheless both coveted somewhat to be equal to \nGod, in so far as each wished to rely on himself in contempt of the order \nof the Divine rule.",

Now seemingly there would have been \"pain in child-bearing,\" even \nhad there been no sin: for the disposition of the female sex is such that \noffspring cannot be born without pain to the bearer. Likewise the \n\"subjection of woman to man\" results from the perfection of the male, and \nthe imperfection of the female sex.

Now through sin our first parents gained in this, \nthat their eyes were opened, according to Gn. 3:7.

And since the movements of corporal creatures are set in order \nthrough the ministry of the angels, according to Augustine (De Trin. iii, \n4), it was fitting that, besides the sword turning every way, there \nshould be cherubim \"to keep the way of the tree of life.\" Hence Augustine \nsays (Gen. ad lit. xi, 40): \"It is to be believed that even in the \nvisible paradise this was done by heavenly powers indeed, so that there \nwas a fiery guard set there by the ministry of angels.\"\nReply to Objection 6: After sin, if man had ate of the tree of life, he would not \nthereby have recovered immortality, but by means of that beneficial food \nhe might have prolonged his life. Hence in the words \"And live for ever,\" \n\"for ever\" signifies \"for a long time.\" For it was not expedient for man \nto remain longer in the unhappiness of this life.\nReply to Objection 7: According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xi, 39),  \"these words \nof God are not so much a mockery of our first parents as a deterrent to \nothers, for whose benefit these things are written, lest they be proud \nlikewise, because Adam not only failed to become that which he coveted to \nbe, but did not keep that to which he was made.\"\nReply to Objection 8: Clothing is necessary to man in his present state of \nunhappiness for two reasons. First, to supply a deficiency in respect of \nexternal harm caused by, for instance, extreme heat or cold. Secondly, to \nhide his ignominy and to cover the shame of those members wherein the \nrebellion of the flesh against the spirit is most manifest.

Hence they were \npunished in two ways. In the first place by being deprived of that which \nwas befitting the state of integrity, namely the place of the earthly \nparadise: and this is indicated (Gn. 3:23) where it is stated that \"God \nsent him out of the paradise of pleasure.\" And since he was unable, of \nhimself, to return to that state of original innocence, it was fitting \nthat obstacles should be placed against his recovering those things that \nwere befitting his original state, namely food (lest he should take of \nthe tree of life) and place; for \"God placed before . . . paradise . . . \nCherubim, and a flaming sword.\" Secondly, they were punished by having \nappointed to them things befitting a nature bereft of the aforesaid \nfavor: and this as regards both the body and the soul. With regard to the \nbody, to which pertains the distinction of sex, one punishment was \nappointed to the woman and another to the man. To the woman punishment \nwas appointed in  respect of two things on account of which she is united \nto the man; and these are the begetting of children, and community of \nworks pertaining to family life. As regards the begetting of children, \nshe was punished in two ways: first in the weariness to which she is \nsubject while carrying the child after conception, and this is indicated \nin the words (Gn. 3:16), \"I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy \nconceptions\"; secondly, in the pain which she suffers in giving birth, \nand this is indicated by the words (Gn. 3:16), \"In sorrow shalt thou \nbring forth.\" As regards family life she was punished by being subjected \nto her husband's authority, and this is conveyed in the words (Gn. 3:16), \n\"Thou shalt be under thy husband's power.\"\nNow, just as it belongs to the woman to be subject to her husband in \nmatters relating to the family life, so it belongs to the husband to \nprovide the necessaries of that life. In this respect he was punished in \nthree ways. First, by the barrenness of the earth, in the words (Gn. 3:17), \"Cursed is the earth in thy work.\" Secondly, by the cares of his \ntoil, without which he does not win the fruits of the earth; hence the \nwords (Gn. 3:17), \"With labor and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the \ndays of thy life.\" Thirdly, by the obstacles encountered by the tillers \nof the soil, wherefore it is written (Gn. 3:18), \"Thorns and thistles \nshall it bring forth to thee.\"\nLikewise a triple punishment is ascribed to them on the part of the \nsoul. First, by reason of the confusion they experienced at the rebellion \nof the flesh against the spirit; hence it is written (Gn. 3:7): \"The eyes \nof them both were opened; and . . . they perceived themselves to be \nnaked.\" Secondly, by the reproach for their sin, indicated by the words \n(Gn. 3:22), \"Behold Adam is become as one of Us.\" Thirdly, by the \nreminder of their coming death, when it was said to him (Gn. 3:19): \"Dust \nthou art and into dust thou shalt return.\" To this also pertains that God \nmade them garments of skin, as a sign of their mortality.",

FP, Question [98], Article [2]].\nThe subjection of the woman to her husband is to be understood as \ninflicted in punishment of the woman, not as to his headship (since even \nbefore sin the man was the \"head\" and governor \"of the woman\"), but as to \nher having now to obey her husband's will even against her own.\nIf man had not sinned, the earth would have brought forth thorns and \nthistles to be the food of animals, but not to punish man, because their \ngrowth would bring no labor or punishment for the tiller of the soil, as \nAugustine says (Gen. ad lit. iii, 18).

Either \n'Those shall belong to thee, whom thou shalt deceive by earthly lust,' \nnamely sinners who are signified under the name of earth, or a third kind \nof temptation,  namely curiosity, is signified by these words: for to eat \nearth is to look into things deep and dark.\" The putting of enmities \nbetween him and the woman \"means that we cannot be tempted by the devil, \nexcept through that part of the soul which bears or reflects the likeness \nof a woman. The seed of the devil is the temptation to evil, the seed of \nthe woman is the fruit of good works, whereby the temptation to evil is \nresisted.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [166], Article [2], ad 2) studiousness is \ndirectly, not about knowledge itself, but about the desire and study in \nthe pursuit of knowledge. Now we must judge differently of the knowledge \nitself of truth, and of the desire and study in the pursuit of the \nknowledge of truth. For the knowledge of truth, strictly speaking, is \ngood, but it may be evil accidentally, by reason of some result, either \nbecause one takes pride in knowing the truth, according to 1 Cor. 8:1, \n\"Knowledge puffeth up,\" or because one uses the knowledge of truth in \norder to sin.\nOn the other hand, the desire or study in pursuing the knowledge of \ntruth may be right or wrong. First, when one tends by his study to the \nknowledge of truth as having evil accidentally annexed to it, for \ninstance those who study to know the truth that they may take pride in \ntheir knowledge. Hence Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. 21): \"Some there \nare who forsaking virtue, and ignorant of what God is, and of the majesty \nof that nature which ever remains the same, imagine they are doing \nsomething great, if with surpassing curiosity and keenness they explore \nthe whole mass of this body which we call the world.

Moreover the \nPhilosopher [*Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 8] assigns to games the virtue of \n{eutrapelia}, which we may call \"pleasantness.\"",
        "ANS": "Just as man needs bodily rest for the body's refreshment, \nbecause he cannot always be at work, since his power is finite and equal \nto a certain fixed amount of labor, so too is it with his soul, whose \npower is also finite and equal to a fixed amount of work. Consequently \nwhen he goes beyond his measure in a certain work, he is oppressed and \nbecomes weary, and all the more since when the soul works, the body is at \nwork likewise, in so far as the intellective soul employs forces that \noperate through bodily organs. Now sensible goods are connatural to man, \nand therefore, when the soul arises above sensibles, through being intent \non the operations of reason, there results in consequence a certain \nweariness of soul, whether the operations with which it is occupied be \nthose of the practical or of the speculative reason. Yet this weariness \nis greater if the soul be occupied with the work of contemplation, since \nthereby it is raised higher above sensible things; although perhaps \ncertain outward works of the practical reason entail a greater bodily \nlabor. In either case, however, one man is more soul-wearied than \nanother, according as he is more intensely occupied with works of reason. \nNow just as weariness of the body is dispelled by resting the body, so \nweariness of the soul must needs be remedied by resting the soul: and the \nsoul's rest is pleasure, as stated above (FS, Question [25], Article [2]; FS, Question [31], Article [1], ad 2). Consequently, the remedy for weariness of soul must needs \nconsist in the application of some pleasure, by slackening the tension of \nthe reason's study. Thus in the Conferences of the Fathers xxiv, 21, it \nis related of Blessed John the Evangelist, that when some people were \nscandalized on finding him playing together with his disciples, he is \nsaid to have told one of them who carried a bow to shoot an arrow. And \nwhen the latter had done this several times, he asked him whether he \ncould do it indefinitely, and the man answered that if he continued doing \nit, the bow would break. Whence the Blessed John drew the inference that \nin like manner man's mind would break if its tension were never relaxed.\nNow such like words or deeds wherein nothing further is sought than the \nsoul's delight, are called playful or humorous. Hence it is necessary at \ntimes to make use of them, in order to give rest, as it were, to the \nsoul. This is in agreement with the statement of  the Philosopher (Ethic. \niv, 8) that \"in the intercourse of this life there is a kind of rest that \nis associated with games\": and consequently it is sometimes necessary to \nmake use of such things.\nNevertheless it would seem that in this matter there are three points \nwhich require especial caution. The first and chief is that the pleasure \nin question should not be sought in indecent or injurious deeds or words. \nWherefore Tully says (De Offic. i, 29) that \"one kind of joke is \ndiscourteous, insolent, scandalous, obscene.\" Another thing to be \nobserved is that one lose not the balance of one's mind altogether. Hence \nAmbrose says (De Offic. i, 20): \"We should beware lest, when we seek \nrelaxation of mind, we destroy all that harmony which is the concord of \ngood works\": and Tully says (De Offic. i, 29), that, \"just as we do not \nallow children to enjoy absolute freedom in their games, but only that \nwhich is consistent with good behavior, so our very fun should reflect \nsomething of an upright mind.\" Thirdly, we must be careful, as in all \nother human actions, to conform ourselves to persons, time, and place, \nand take due account of other circumstances, so that our fun \"befit the \nhour and the man,\" as Tully says (De Offic. i, 29).\nNow these things are directed according to the rule of reason: and a \nhabit that operates according to reason is virtue. Therefore there can be \na virtue about games. The Philosopher gives it the name of wittiness \n({eutrapelia}), and a man is said to be pleasant through having a happy \nturn* of mind, whereby he gives his words and deeds a cheerful turn: and \ninasmuch as this virtue restrains a man from immoderate fun, it is \ncomprised under modesty. [*{Eutrapelia} is derived from {trepein} = 'to \nturn'].",
        "RP1": "As stated above, fun should fit with business and persons; \nwherefore Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. i, 17) that \"when the audience is \nweary, it will be useful for the speaker to try something novel or \namusing, provided that joking be not incompatible with the gravity of the \nsubject.\" Now the sacred doctrine is concerned with things of the \ngreatest moment, according to Prov. 8:6, \"Hear, for I will speak of great \nthings.\" Wherefore Ambrose does not altogether exclude fun from human \nspeech, but from the sacred doctrine; hence he begins by saying: \n\"Although jokes are at times fitting and pleasant, nevertheless they are \nincompatible with the ecclesiastical rule; since how can we have recourse \nto things which are not to be found in Holy Writ?\"",

Now it has been stated (Article [2]) that \nplayful or jesting words or deeds are dirigible according to reason. \nWherefore excessive play is that which goes beyond the rule of reason: \nand this happens in two ways. First, on account of the very species of \nthe acts employed for the purpose of fun, and this kind of jesting, \naccording to Tully (De Offic. i, 29), is stated to be \"discourteous, \ninsolent, scandalous, and obscene,\" when to wit a man, for the purpose of \njesting, employs indecent words or deeds, or such as are injurious to his \nneighbor, these being of themselves mortal sins. And thus it is evident \nthat excessive play is a mortal sin.\nSecondly, there may be excess in play, through lack of due \ncircumstances: for instance when people make use of fun at undue  times \nor places, or out of keeping with the matter in hand, or persons. This \nmay be sometimes a mortal sin on account of the strong attachment to \nplay, when a man prefers the pleasure he derives therefrom to the love of \nGod, so as to be willing to disobey a commandment of God or of the Church \nrather than forego, such like amusements. Sometimes, however, it is a \nvenial sin, for instance where a man is not so attached to amusement as \nto be willing for its sake to do anything in disobedience to God.",

Other things, however, are sins according to their \nspecies, such as murder, fornication, and the like: and fun is no excuse \nfor these; in fact they make fun scandalous and obscene.",

        "RP3": "As stated (Article [2]), play is necessary for the intercourse of \nhuman life. Now whatever is useful to human intercourse may have a lawful \nemployment ascribed to it. Wherefore the occupation of play-actors, the \nobject of which is to cheer the heart of man, is not unlawful in itself; \nnor are they in a state of sin provided that their playing be moderated, \nnamely that they use no unlawful words or deeds in order to amuse, and \nthat they do not introduce play into undue matters and seasons. And \nalthough in human affairs, they have no other occupation in reference to \nother men, nevertheless in reference to themselves, and to God, they \nperform other actions both serious and virtuous, such as prayer and the \nmoderation of their own passions and operations, while sometimes they \ngive alms to the poor. Wherefore those who maintain them in moderation do \nnot sin but act justly, by rewarding them for their services. on the \nother hand, if a man spends too much on such persons, or maintains those \ncomedians who practice unlawful mirth, he sins as encouraging them in \ntheir sin. Hence Augustine says (Tract. c. in Joan.) that \"to give one's \nproperty to comedians is a great sin, not a virtue\"; unless by chance \nsome play-actor were in extreme need, in which case one would have to \nassist him, for Ambrose says (De Offic.

        "ANS": "It is not in the outward things themselves which man \nuses, that there is vice, but on the part of man who uses them \nimmoderately. This lack of moderation occurs in two ways. First, in \ncomparison with the customs of those among whom one lives; wherefore \nAugustine says (Confess. iii, 8): \"Those offenses which are contrary to \nthe customs of men, are to be avoided according to the customs generally \nprevailing, so that a thing agreed upon and confirmed by custom or law of \nany city or nation may not be violated at the lawless pleasure of any, \nwhether citizen or foreigner. For any part, which harmonizeth not with \nits whole, is offensive.\" Secondly, the lack of moderation in the use of \nthese things may arise from the inordinate attachment of the user, the \nresult being that a man sometimes takes too much pleasure in using them, \neither in accordance with the custom of those among whom he dwells or \ncontrary to such custom. Hence Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, \n12): \"We must avoid excessive pleasure in the use of things, for it leads \nnot only wickedly to abuse the customs of those among whom we dwell, but \nfrequently to exceed their bounds, so that, whereas it lay hidden, while \nunder the restraint of established morality, it displays its deformity in \na most lawless outbreak.\"\nIn point of excess, this inordinate attachment occurs in three ways. \nFirst when a man seeks glory from excessive attention to dress; in so far \nas dress and such like things are a kind of ornament. Hence Gregory says \n(Hom. xl in Ev.): \"There are some who think that attention to finery and \ncostly dress is no sin. Surely, if this were no fault, the word of God \nwould not say so expressly that the rich man who was tortured in hell had \nbeen clothed in purple and fine linen. No one, forsooth, seeks costly \napparel\" (such, namely, as exceeds his estate) \"save for vainglory.\" \nSecondly, when a man seeks sensuous pleasure from excessive attention to \ndress, in so far as dress is directed to the body's comfort. Thirdly, \nwhen a man is too solicitous [*Cf. Question [55], Article [6]] in his attention to \noutward apparel.\nAccordingly Andronicus [*De Affectibus] reckons three virtues in \nconnection with outward attire; namely \"humility,\" which excludes the \nseeking of glory, wherefore he says that humility is \"the habit of \navoiding excessive expenditure and parade\"; \"contentment\" [*Cf. Question [143], \nObjection [4]], which excludes the seeking of sensuous pleasure, wherefore he \nsays that \"contentedness is the habit that makes a man satisfied with \nwhat is suitable, and enables him to determine what is becoming in his \nmanner of life\" (according to the saying of the Apostle, 1 Tim. 6:8): \n\"Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these let us be \ncontent;\"---and \"simplicity,\" which excludes excessive solicitude about \nsuch things, wherefore he says that \"simplicity is a habit that makes a \nman contented with what he has.\"\nIn the point of deficiency there may be inordinate attachment in two \nways. First, through a man's neglect to give the requisite  study or \ntrouble to the use of outward apparel. Wherefore the Philosopher says \n(Ethic. vii, 7) that \"it is a mark of effeminacy to let one's cloak trail \non the ground to avoid the trouble of lifting it up.\" Secondly, by \nseeking glory from the very lack of attention to outward attire. Hence \nAugustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12) that \"not only the glare \nand pomp of outward things, but even dirt and the weeds of mourning may \nbe a subject of ostentation, all the more dangerous as being a decoy \nunder the guise of God's service\"; and the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, \n7) that \"both excess and inordinate defect are a subject of ostentation.\"",
        "RP1": "Although outward attire does not come from nature, it \nbelongs to natural reason to moderate it; so that we are naturally \ninclined to be the recipients of the virtue that moderates outward \nraiment.",
        "RP2": "Those who are placed in a position of dignity, or again the \nministers of the altar, are attired in more costly apparel than others, \nnot for the sake of their own glory, but to indicate the excellence of \ntheir office or of the Divine worship: wherefore this is not sinful in \nthem. Hence Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12): \"Whoever uses \noutward things in such a way as to exceed the bounds observed by the good \npeople among whom he dwells, either signifies something by so doing, or \nis guilty of sin, inasmuch as he uses these things for sensual pleasure \nor ostentation.\"\nLikewise there may be sin on the part of deficiency: although it is not \nalways a sin to wear coarser clothes than other people. For, if this be \ndone through ostentation or pride, in order to set oneself above others, \nit is a sin of superstition; whereas, if this be done to tame the flesh, \nor to humble the spirit, it belongs to the virtue of temperance. Hence \nAugustine says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12): \"Whoever uses transitory \nthings with greater restraint than is customary with those among whom he \ndwells, is either temperate or superstitious.\" Especially, however, is \nthe use of coarse raiment befitting to those who by word and example urge \nothers to repentance, as did the prophets of whom the Apostle is speaking \nin the passage quoted. Wherefore a gloss on Mt. 3:4, says: \"He who \npreaches penance, wears the garb of penance.\"",

This is an assault on the Divine \nhandiwork, a distortion of the truth.

Therefore the adornment of women is not \ndevoid of mortal sin.",

Now \nthe former is a sin, for it is written (Dt. 22:5): \"A woman shall not be \nclothed with man's apparel, neither shall a man use woman's apparel.\" \nTherefore it seems that also the excessive adornment of women is a mortal \nsin.",
        "OB4": "If this were true it would seem that the makers \nof these means of adornment sin mortally.",
        "ANS": "As regards the adornment of women, we must bear in mind \nthe general statements made above (Article [1]) concerning outward apparel, and \nalso something special, namely that a woman's apparel may incite men to \nlust, according to Prov. 7:10, \"Behold a woman meeteth him in harlot's \nattire, prepared to deceive souls.\"\nNevertheless a woman may use means to please her husband, lest through \ndespising her he fall into adultery. Hence it is written (1 Cor. 7:34) \nthat the woman \"that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how \nshe may please her husband.\" Wherefore if a married woman adorn herself \nin order to please her husband she can do this without sin.\nBut those women who have no husband nor wish to have one, or who are in \na state of life inconsistent with marriage, cannot without sin desire to \ngive lustful pleasure to those men who see them, because this is to \nincite them to sin. And if indeed they adorn themselves with this \nintention of provoking others to lust, they sin mortally; whereas if they \ndo so from frivolity, or from vanity for the sake of ostentation, it is \nnot always mortal, but sometimes venial. And the same applies to men in \nthis respect.  Hence Augustine says (Ep. ccxlv ad Possid.): \"I do not \nwish you to be hasty in forbidding the wearing of gold or costly attire \nexcept in the case of those who being neither married nor wishful to \nmarry, should think how they may please God: whereas the others think on \nthe things of the world, either husbands how they may please their wives, \nor wives how they may please their husbands, except that it is unbecoming \nfor women though married to uncover their hair, since the Apostle \ncommands them to cover the head.\" Yet in this case some might be excused \nfrom sin, when they do this not through vanity but on account of some \ncontrary custom: although such a custom is not to be commended.",
        "RP1": "As a gloss says on this passage, \"The wives of those who \nwere in distress despised their husbands, and decked themselves that they \nmight please other men\": and the Apostle forbids this. Cyprian is \nspeaking in the same sense; yet he does not forbid married women to adorn \nthemselves in order to please their husbands, lest the latter be afforded \nan occasion of sin with other women. Hence the Apostle says (1 Tim. 2:9): \n\"Women . . . in ornate [Douay: 'decent'] apparel, adorning themselves \nwith modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or \ncostly attire\": whence we are given to understand that women are not \nforbidden to adorn themselves soberly and moderately but to do so \nexcessively, shamelessly, and immodestly.",
        "RP2": "Cyprian is speaking of women painting themselves: this is a \nkind of falsification, which cannot be devoid of sin.

I doubt whether \neven their husbands are willing to be deceived by it, by whom alone\" \n(i.e. the husbands) \"are they to be permitted, but not ordered, to adorn \nthemselves.\" However, such painting does not always involve a mortal sin, \nbut only when it is done for the sake of sensuous pleasure or in contempt \nof God, and it is to like cases that Cyprian refers.\nIt must, however, be observed that it is one thing to counterfeit a \nbeauty one has not, and another to hide a disfigurement arising from some \ncause such as sickness or the like. For this is lawful, since according \nto the Apostle (1 Cor. 12:23), \"such as we think to be the less honorable \nmembers of the body, about these we put more abundant honor.\"",
        "RP3": "As stated in the foregoing Article, outward apparel should \nbe consistent with the estate of the person, according to the general \ncustom. Hence it is in itself sinful for a woman to wear man's clothes, \nor vice versa; especially since this may be a cause of sensuous pleasure; \nand it is expressly forbidden in the Law (Dt. 22) because the Gentiles \nused to practice this change of attire for the purpose of idolatrous \nsuperstition. Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without sin on \naccount of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, \nor through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive.",
        "RP4": "In the case of an art directed to the production of goods \nwhich men cannot use without sin, it follows that the workmen sin in \nmaking such things, as directly affording others an occasion of sin; for \ninstance, if a man were to make idols or anything pertaining to \nidolatrous worship. But in the case of an art the products of which may \nbe employed by man either for a good or for an evil use, such as swords, \narrows, and the like, the practice of such an art is not sinful. These \nalone should be called arts; wherefore Chrysostom says [*Hom. xlix super \nMatth.]: \"The name of art should be applied to those only which \ncontribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life.\" In the \ncase of an art that produces things which for the most part some people \nput to an evil use, although such arts are not unlawful in themselves, \nnevertheless, according to the teaching of Plato, they should be \nextirpated from the State by the governing authority. Accordingly, since \nwomen may lawfully adorn themselves, whether to maintain the fitness of \ntheir estate, or even by adding something thereto, in order to please \ntheir husbands, it follows that those who make such means of adornment do \nnot sin in the practice of their art, except perhaps by inventing means \nthat are superfluous and fantastic.

Therefore \nprophecy is not a habit.",
        "ANS": "As the Apostle says (Eph. 5:13), \"all that is made \nmanifest is light,\" because, to wit, just as the manifestation of the \nmaterial sight takes place through material light, so too the \nmanifestation of intellectual sight takes place through intellectual \nlight. Accordingly manifestation must be proportionate to the light by \nmeans of which it takes place, even as an effect is proportionate to its \ncause. Since then prophecy pertains to a knowledge that surpasses natural \nreason, as stated above (Article [1]), it follows that prophecy requires an \nintellectual light surpassing the light of natural reason. Hence the \nsaying of Micah 7:8: \"When I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.\" Now \nlight may be in a subject in two ways: first, by way of an abiding form, \nas material light is in the sun, and in fire; secondly, by way of a \npassion, or passing impression, as light is in the air. Now the prophetic \nlight is not in the prophet's intellect by way of an abiding form, else a \nprophet would always be able to prophesy, which is clearly false. For \nGregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.): \"Sometimes the spirit of prophecy is \nlacking to the prophet, nor is it always within the call of his mind, yet \nso that in its absence he knows that its presence is due to a gift.\" \nHence Eliseus said of the Sunamite woman (4 Kgs. 4:27): \"Her soul is in \nanguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.\" The \nreason for this is that the intellectual light that is in a subject by \nway of an abiding and complete form, perfects the intellect chiefly to \nthe effect of knowing the principle of the things manifested by that \nlight; thus by the light of the active intellect the intellect knows \nchiefly the first principles of all things known naturally. Now the  \nprinciple of things pertaining to supernatural knowledge, which are \nmanifested by prophecy, is God Himself, Whom the prophets do not see in \nHis essence, although He is seen by the blessed in heaven, in whom this \nlight is by way of an abiding and complete form, according to Ps. 35:10, \n\"In Thy light we shall see light.\"\nIt follows therefore that the prophetic light is in the prophet's soul \nby way of a passion or transitory impression. This is indicated Ex. \n33:22: \"When my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock,\" \netc., and 3 Kgs. 19:11: \"Go forth and stand upon the mount before the \nLord; and behold the Lord passeth,\" etc. Hence it is that even as the air \nis ever in need of a fresh enlightening, so too the prophet's mind is \nalways in need of a fresh revelation; thus a disciple who has not yet \nacquired the principles of an art needs to have every detail explained to \nhim. Wherefore it is written (Is. 1:4): \"In the morning He wakeneth my \near, so that I may hear Him as a master.\" This is also indicated by the \nvery manner in which prophecies are uttered: thus it is stated that \"the \nLord spake to such and such a prophet,\" or that \"the word of the Lord,\" \nor \"the hand of the Lord was made upon him.\"\nBut a habit is an abiding form. Wherefore it is evident that, properly \nspeaking, prophecy is not a habit.",
        "RP1": "This division of the Philosopher's does not comprise \nabsolutely all that is in the soul, but only such as can be principles of \nmoral actions, which are done sometimes from passion, sometimes from \nhabit, sometimes from mere power, as in the case of those who perform an \naction from the judgment of their reason before having the habit of that \naction.\nHowever, prophecy may be reduced to a passion, provided we understand \npassion to denote any kind of receiving, in which sense the Philosopher \nsays (De Anima iii, 4) that \"to understand is, in a way, to be passive.\" \nFor just as, in natural knowledge, the possible intellect is passive to \nthe light of the active intellect, so too in prophetic knowledge the \nhuman intellect is passive to the enlightening of the Divine light.",
        "RP2": "Just as in corporeal things, when a passion ceases, there \nremains a certain aptitude to a repetition of the passion---thus wood \nonce ignited is more easily ignited again, so too in the prophet's \nintellect, after the actual enlightenment has ceased, there remains an \naptitude to be enlightened anew---thus when the mind has once been \naroused to devotion, it is more easily recalled to its former devotion. \nHence Augustine says (De orando Deum. Ep. cxxx, 9) that our prayers need \nto be frequent, \"lest devotion be extinguished as soon as it is kindled.\"\nWe might, however, reply that a person is called a prophet, even while \nhis prophetic enlightenment ceases to be actual, on account of his being \ndeputed by God, according to Jer. 1:5, \"And I made thee a prophet unto \nthe nations.\"",

Now \nprophetic knowledge comes through a Divine light, whereby it is possible \nto know all things both Divine and human, both spiritual and corporeal; \nand consequently the prophetic revelation extends to them all. Thus by \nthe ministry of spirits a prophetic revelation concerning the perfections \nof God and the angels was made to Is. 6:1, where it is written, \"I saw \nthe Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated.\" Moreover his  prophecy \ncontains matters referring to natural bodies, according to the words of \nIs. 40:12, \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,\" etc. \nIt also contains matters relating to human conduct, according to Is. \n58:1, \"Deal thy bread to the hungry,\" etc.; and besides this it contains \nthings pertaining to future events, according to Is. 47:9, \"Two things \nshall come upon thee suddenly in one day, barrenness and widowhood.\"\nSince, however, prophecy is about things remote from our knowledge, it \nmust be observed that the more remote things are from our knowledge the \nmore pertinent they are to prophecy. Of such things there are three \ndegrees. One degree comprises things remote from the knowledge, either \nsensitive or intellective, of some particular man, but not from the \nknowledge of all men; thus a particular man knows by sense things present \nto him locally, which another man does not know by human sense, since \nthey are removed from him. Thus Eliseus knew prophetically what his \ndisciple Giezi had done in his absence (4 Kgs. 5:26), and in like manner \nthe secret thoughts of one man are manifested prophetically to another, \naccording to 1 Cor. 14:25; and again in this way what one man knows by \ndemonstration may be revealed to another prophetically.\nThe second degree comprises those things which surpass the knowledge of \nall men without exception, not that they are in themselves unknowable, \nbut on account of a defect in human knowledge; such as the mystery of the \nTrinity, which was revealed by the Seraphim saying: \"Holy, Holy, Holy,\" \netc. (Is. 6:3).\nThe last degree comprises things remote from the knowledge of all men, \nthrough being in themselves unknowable; such are future contingencies, \nthe truth of which is indeterminate. And since that which is predicated \nuniversally and by its very nature, takes precedence of that which is \npredicated in a limited and relative sense, it follows that revelation of \nfuture events belongs most properly to prophecy, and from this prophecy \napparently takes its name. Hence Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.): \"And \nsince a prophet is so called because he foretells the future, his name \nloses its significance when he speaks of the past or present.\"",

Again, though this twofold knowledge is always \nunited in the Divine intellect, it is not always united in the prophetic  \nrevelation, because an imprint made by an active cause is not always on a \npar with the virtue of that cause. Hence sometimes the prophetic \nrevelation is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge, in so \nfar as the latter regards future contingencies in themselves: and such \nthings happen in the same way as foretold, for example this saying of Is. \n7:14: \"Behold a virgin shall conceive.\" Sometimes, however, the prophetic \nrevelation is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge as \nknowing the order of causes to effects; and then at times the event is \notherwise than foretold. Yet the prophecy does not cover a falsehood, for \nthe meaning of the prophecy is that inferior causes, whether they be \nnatural causes or human acts, are so disposed as to lead to such a \nresult. In this way we are to understand the saying of Is. 38:1: \"Thou \nshalt die, and not live\"; in other words, \"The disposition of thy body \nhas a tendency to death\": and the saying of Jonas 3:4, \"Yet forty days, \nand Nineveh shall be destroyed,\" that is to say, \"Its merits demand that \nit should be destroyed.\" God is said \"to repent,\" metaphorically, \ninasmuch as He bears Himself after the manner of one who repents, by \n\"changing His sentence, although He changes not His counsel\" [*Cf.

Now both these \ncauses are more applicable to a person while asleep than while awake, \nbecause, while awake, the soul is occupied with external sensibles, so \nthat it is less receptive of the subtle impressions either of spiritual \nsubstances, or even of natural causes; although as regards the perfection \nof judgment, the reason is more alert in waking than in sleeping.",

Now, to \nforeknow future things, as they are in themselves, is proper to the \nDivine intellect, to Whose eternity all things are present, as stated in \nthe FP, Question [14], Article [13]. Wherefore such like foreknowledge of the future \ncannot come from nature, but from Divine revelation alone. On the other \nhand, future things can be foreknown in their causes with a natural \nknowledge even by man: thus a physician foreknows future health or death \nin certain causes, through previous experimental knowledge of the order \nof those causes to such effects. Such like knowledge of the future may be \nunderstood to be in a man by nature in two ways. In one way that the \nsoul, from that which it holds, is able to foreknow the future, and thus \nAugustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13): \"Some have deemed the human soul \nto contain a certain power of divination.\" This seems to be in accord \nwith the opinion of Plato [*Phaed. xxvii; Civit. vi], who held that our \nsouls have knowledge of all things by participating in the ideas; but \nthat this knowledge is obscured in them by union with the body; yet in \nsome more, in others less, according to a difference in bodily purity. \nAccording to this it might be said that men, whose souls are not much \nobscured through union with the body, are able to foreknow such like \nfuture things by their own knowledge. Against this opinion Augustine says \n(Gen. ad lit. xii, 13): \"How is it that the soul cannot always have this \npower of divination, since it always wishes to have it?\"\nSince, however, it seems truer, according to the opinion of Aristotle, \nthat the soul acquires knowledge from sensibles, as  stated in the FP, \nQuestion [84], Article [6], it is better to have recourse to another explanation, and to \nhold that men have no such foreknowledge of the future, but that they can \nacquire it by means of experience, wherein they are helped by their \nnatural disposition, which depends on the perfection of a man's \nimaginative power, and the clarity of his understanding.\nNevertheless this latter foreknowledge of the future differs in two ways \nfrom the former, which comes through Divine revelation. First, because \nthe former can be about any events whatever, and this infallibly; whereas \nthe latter foreknowledge, which can be had naturally, is about certain \neffects, to which human experience may extend. Secondly, because the \nformer prophecy is \"according to the unchangeable truth\" [*Question [171], Article [3], \nObjection [1]], while the latter is not, and can cover a falsehood. Now the \nformer foreknowledge, and not the latter, properly belongs to prophecy, \nbecause, as stated above (Question [171], Article [3]), prophetic knowledge is of things \nwhich naturally surpass human knowledge.

Hence Gregory says (Dial. iv, 26) \nthat \"the soul, at the approach of death, foresees certain future things, \nby reason of the subtlety of its nature,\" inasmuch as it is receptive \neven of slight impressions. Or again, it knows future things by a \nrevelation of the angels; but not by its own power, because according to \nAugustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 13), \"if this were so, it would be able to \nforeknow the future whenever it willed,\" which is clearly false.",

First, \non account of their respective acts: for prophecy pertains to the \nintellect, whose act precedes the act of the will, which power is \nperfected by charity. For this reason the Apostle (1 Cor. 13) reckons \nprophecy with other things pertinent to the intellect, that can be had \nwithout charity. Secondly, on account of their respective ends.

Wherefore also the Sibyls foretold many true things \nabout Christ.\nYet even when the demons' prophets are instructed by the demons, they \nforetell the truth, sometimes by virtue of their own nature, the author \nof which is the Holy Ghost, and sometimes by revelation of the good \nspirits, as Augustine declares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 19): so that even then \nthis truth which the demons proclaim is from the Holy Ghost.",

        "ANS": "Prophecy denotes Divine knowledge as existing afar off. \nWherefore it is said of the prophets (Heb. 11:13) that \"they were \nbeholding . . . afar off.\" But those who are in heaven and in the state \nof bliss see, not as from afar off, but rather, as it were, from near at \nhand, according to Ps. 139:14, \"The upright shall dwell with Thy \ncountenance.\" Hence it is evident that prophetic knowledge differs from \nthe perfect knowledge, which we shall have in heaven, so that it is \ndistinguished therefrom as the imperfect from the perfect, and when the \nlatter comes the former is made void, as appears from the words of the \nApostle (1 Cor. 13:10).\nSome, however, wishing to discriminate between prophetic knowledge and \nthe knowledge of the blessed, have maintained that the prophets see the \nvery essence of God (which they call the \"mirror of eternity\") [*Cf. De \nVeritate, xii, 6; Sent. II, D, XI, part 2, art. 2, ad 4], not, however, \nin the way in which it is the object of the blessed, but as containing \nthe types [*Cf. FP, Question [15]] of future events. But this is altogether \nimpossible. For God is the object of bliss in His very essence, according \nto the saying of Augustine (Confess. v, 4): \"Happy whoso knoweth Thee, \nthough he know not these,\" i.e. creatures. Now it is not possible to see \nthe types of creatures in the very essence of God without seeing It, both \nbecause the Divine essence is Itself the type of all things that are \nmade---the ideal type adding nothing to the Divine essence save only a \nrelationship to the creature---and because knowledge of a thing in \nitself---and such is the knowledge of God as the object of heavenly \nbliss---precedes knowledge of that thing in its relation to something \nelse---and such is the knowledge of God as containing the types of \nthings. Consequently it is impossible for prophets to see God as \ncontaining the types of creatures, and yet not as the object of bliss. \nTherefore we must conclude that the prophetic vision is not the vision of \nthe very essence of God, and that the prophets do not see in the Divine \nessence Itself the things they do see, but that they see them in certain \nimages, according as they are enlightened by the Divine light.\nWherefore Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv), in speaking of prophetic visions, \nsays that \"the wise theologian calls that vision divine which is effected \nby images of things lacking a bodily form through the seer being rapt in \ndivine things.\" And these images illumined by the Divine light have more \nof the nature of a mirror than the Divine essence: since in a mirror \nimages are formed from other things, and this cannot be said of God. Yet \nthe prophet's mind thus enlightened may be called a mirror, in so far as \na likeness of the truth of the Divine foreknowledge is formed therein, \nfor which reason it is called the \"mirror of eternity,\" as representing \nGod's foreknowledge, for God in His eternity sees all things as present \nbefore Him, as stated above (Question [172], Article [1]).",

        "ANS": "As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), \"prophetic \nknowledge pertains most of all to the intellect.\" Now two things have to \nbe considered in connection with the knowledge possessed by the human \nmind, namely the acceptance or representation of things, and the judgment \nof the things represented. Now things are represented to the human mind \nunder the form of species: and according to the order of nature, they \nmust be represented first to the senses, secondly to the imagination,  \nthirdly to the passive intellect, and these are changed by the species \nderived from the phantasms, which change results from the enlightening \naction of the active intellect. Now in the imagination there are the \nforms of sensible things not only as received from the senses, but also \ntransformed in various ways, either on account of some bodily \ntransformation (as in the case of people who are asleep or out of their \nsenses), or through the coordination of the phantasms, at the command of \nreason, for the purpose of understanding something. For just as the \nvarious arrangements of the letters of the alphabet convey various ideas \nto the understanding, so the various coordinations of the phantasms \nproduce various intelligible species of the intellect.\nAs to the judgment formed by the human mind, it depends on the power of \nthe intellectual light.\nNow the gift of prophecy confers on the human mind something which \nsurpasses the natural faculty in both these respects, namely as to the \njudgment which depends on the inflow of intellectual light, and as to the \nacceptance or representation of things, which is effected by means of \ncertain species. Human teaching may be likened to prophetic revelation in \nthe second of these respects, but not in the first. For a man represents \ncertain things to his disciple by signs of speech, but he cannot \nenlighten him inwardly as God does.\nBut it is the first of these two that holds the chief place in prophecy, \nsince judgment is the complement of knowledge. Wherefore if certain \nthings are divinely represented to any man by means of imaginary \nlikenesses, as happened to Pharaoh (Gn. 41:1-7) and to Nabuchodonosor \n(Dan. 4:1-2), or even by bodily likenesses, as happened to Balthasar \n(Dan. 5:5), such a man is not to be considered a prophet, unless his mind \nbe enlightened for the purpose of judgment; and such an apparition is \nsomething imperfect in the genus of prophecy. Wherefore some [*Rabbi \nMoyses, Doct. Perplex. II, xxxvi] have called this \"prophetic ecstasy,\" \nand such is divination by dreams. And yet a man will be a prophet, if his \nintellect be enlightened merely for the purpose of judging of things seen \nin imagination by others, as in the case of Joseph who interpreted \nPharaoh's dream. But, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), \n\"especially is he a prophet who excels in both respects, so,\" to wit, \"as \nto see in spirit likenesses significant of things corporeal, and \nunderstand them by the quickness of his intellect.\"\nNow sensible forms are divinely presented to the prophet's mind, \nsometimes externally by means of the senses---thus Daniel saw the writing \non the wall (Dan. 5:25)---sometimes by means of imaginary forms, either \nof exclusively Divine origin and not received through the senses (for \ninstance, if images of colors were imprinted on the imagination of one \nblind from birth), or divinely coordinated from those derived from the \nsenses---thus Jeremiah saw the \"boiling caldron . . . from the face of \nthe north\" (Jer. 1:13)---or by the direct impression of intelligible \nspecies on the mind, as in the case of those who receive infused \nscientific  knowledge or wisdom, such as Solomon or the apostles.\nBut intellectual light is divinely imprinted on the human \nmind---sometimes for the purpose of judging of things seen by others, as \nin the case of Joseph, quoted above, and of the apostles whose \nunderstanding our Lord opened \"that they might understand the scriptures\" \n(Lk. 24:45); and to this pertains the \"interpretation of \nspeeches\"---sometimes for the purpose of judging according to Divine \ntruth, of the things which a man apprehends in the ordinary course of \nnature---sometimes for the purpose of discerning truthfully and \nefficaciously what is to be done, according to Is. 63:14, \"The Spirit of \nthe Lord was their leader.\"\nHence it is evident that prophetic revelation is conveyed sometimes by \nthe mere infusion of light, sometimes by imprinting species anew, or by a \nnew coordination of species.",
        "RP1": "As stated above, sometimes in prophetic revelation \nimaginary species previously derived from the senses are divinely \ncoordinated so as to accord with the truth to be revealed, and then \nprevious experience is operative in the production of the images, but not \nwhen they are impressed on the mind wholly from without.",

        "ANS": "The excellence of the means is measured chiefly by the \nend. Now the end of prophecy is the manifestation of a truth that \nsurpasses the faculty of man. Wherefore the more effective this \nmanifestation is, the more excellent the prophecy. But it is evident that \nthe manifestation of divine truth by means of the bare contemplation of \nthe truth itself, is more effective than that which is conveyed under the \nsimilitude of corporeal things, for it approaches nearer to the heavenly \nvision whereby the truth is seen in God's essence. Hence it follows that \nthe prophecy whereby a supernatural truth is seen by intellectual vision, \nis more excellent than that in which a supernatural truth is manifested \nby means of the similitudes of corporeal things in the vision of the \nimagination.\nMoreover the prophet's mind is shown thereby to be more lofty: even as \nin human teaching the hearer, who is able to grasp the bare intelligible \ntruth the master propounds, is shown to have a better understanding than \none who needs to be taken by the hand and helped by means of examples \ntaken from objects of sense. Hence it is said in commendation of David's \nprophecy (2 Kgs. 23:3): \"The strong one of Israel spoke to me,\" and \nfurther on (2 Kgs. 23:4): \"As the light of the morning, when the sun \nriseth, shineth in the morning without clouds.\"",

Nevertheless the prophecy in which the \nbare intelligible truth is revealed is greater than all.",

Now, in the prophetic knowledge, imaginary vision is \nrequired, not for its own sake, but on account of the manifestation of \nthe intelligible truth. Wherefore prophecy is all the more excellent \naccording as it needs it less.",

In like manner prophecy implies a certain \nobscurity, and remoteness from the intelligible truth; wherefore the name \nof prophet is more properly applied to those who see by imaginary vision. \nAnd yet the more excellent prophecy is that which is conveyed by \nintellectual vision, provided the same truth be revealed in either case. \nIf, however, the intellectual light be divinely infused in a person, not \nthat he may know some supernatural things, but that he may be able to \njudge, with the certitude of divine truth, of things that can be known by \nhuman reason, such intellectual prophecy is beneath that which is \nconveyed by an imaginary vision leading to a supernatural truth. It was \nthis kind of prophecy that all those had who are included in the ranks of \nthe prophets, who moreover were called prophets for the special reason \nthat they exercised the prophetic calling officially. Hence they spoke as \nGod's representatives, saying to the people: \"Thus saith the Lord\": but \nnot so the authors of the \"sacred writings,\" several of whom treated more \nfrequently of things that can be known by human reason, not in God's \nname, but in their own, yet with the assistance of the Divine light \nwithal.",

Now imaginary vision is \na kind of medium in prophetic knowledge. Therefore the degrees of \nprophecy should be distinguished according to imaginary vision.",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [173], Article [2]), the prophecy wherein, by \nthe intelligible light, a supernatural truth is revealed through an \nimaginary vision, holds the mean between the prophecy wherein a \nsupernatural truth is revealed without imaginary vision, and that wherein \nthrough the intelligible light and without an imaginary vision, man is \ndirected to know or do things pertaining to human conduct. Now knowledge \nis more proper to prophecy than is action; wherefore the lowest degree of \nprophecy is when a man, by an inward instinct, is moved to perform some \noutward action. Thus it is related of Samson (Judges 15:14) that \"the \nSpirit of the Lord came strongly upon him, and as the flax [*'Lina.' St. \nThomas apparently read 'ligna' ('wood')] is wont to be consumed at the \napproach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and \nloosed.\" The second degree of prophecy is when a man is enlightened by an \ninward light so as to know certain things, which, however, do not go \nbeyond the bounds of natural knowledge: thus it is related of Solomon (3 \nKgs. 4:32,33) that \"he spoke . . . parables . . . and he treated about \ntrees from the cedar that is in Libanus unto the hyssop that cometh out \nof the wall, and he discoursed of beasts and of fowls, and of creeping \nthings and of fishes\": and all of this came from divine inspiration, for \nit was stated previously (3 Kgs. 4:29): \"God gave to Solomon wisdom and \nunderstanding exceeding much.\"\nNevertheless these two degrees are beneath prophecy properly so called, \nbecause they do not attain to supernatural truth. The prophecy wherein \nsupernatural truth is manifested through imaginary vision is \ndifferentiated first according to the difference between dreams which \noccur during sleep, and vision which occurs while one is awake. The \nlatter belongs to a higher degree of prophecy, since the prophetic light \nthat draws the soul away to supernatural things while it is awake and \noccupied with sensible things would seem to be stronger than that which \nfinds a man's soul asleep and withdrawn from objects of sense. Secondly \nthe degrees of this prophecy are differentiated according to the \nexpressiveness of the imaginary signs whereby the intelligible truth is \nconveyed. And since words are the most expressive signs of intelligible \ntruth, it would seem to be a higher degree of prophecy when the prophet, \nwhether awake or asleep, hears words expressive of an intelligible truth, \nthan when he sees things significative of truth, for instance \"the seven \nfull ears of corn\" signified \"seven years of plenty\" (Gn. 41:22,26). In \nsuch like signs prophecy would seem to be the more  excellent, according \nas the signs are more expressive, for instance when Jeremias saw the \nburning of the city under the figure of a boiling cauldron (Jer. 1:13). \nThirdly, it is evidently a still higher degree of prophecy when a prophet \nnot only sees signs of words or deeds, but also, either awake or asleep, \nsees someone speaking or showing something to him, since this proves the \nprophet's mind to have approached nearer to the cause of the revelation. \nFourthly, the height of a degree of prophecy may be measured according to \nthe appearance of the person seen: for it is a higher degree of prophecy, \nif he who speaks or shows something to the waking or sleeping prophet be \nseen by him under the form of an angel, than if he be seen by him under \nthe form of man: and higher still is it, if he be seen by the prophet \nwhether asleep or awake, under the appearance of God, according to Is. \n6:1, \"I saw the Lord sitting.\"\nBut above all these degrees there is a third kind of prophecy, wherein \nan intelligible and supernatural truth is shown without any imaginary \nvision. However, this goes beyond the bounds of prophecy properly so \ncalled, as stated above (Article [2], ad 3); and consequently the degrees of \nprophecy are properly distinguished according to imaginary vision.",

For before the law, Abraham and the other \npatriarchs were prophetically taught things pertinent to faith in the \nGodhead. Hence they are called prophets, according to Ps. 104:15, \"Do no \nevil to My prophets,\" which words are said especially on behalf of \nAbraham and Isaac. Under the Law prophetic revelation of things pertinent \nto faith in the Godhead was made in a yet more excellent way than \nhitherto, because then not only certain special persons or families but \nthe whole people had to be instructed in these matters. Hence the Lord \nsaid to Moses (Ex. 6:2,3): \"I am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to \nIsaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God almighty, and My name Adonai I \ndid not show to them\"; because previously the patriarchs had been taught \nto believe in a general way in God, one and Almighty, while Moses was \nmore fully instructed in the simplicity of the Divine essence, when it \nwas said to him (Ex. 3:14): \"I am Who am\"; and this name is signified by \nJews in the word \"Adonai\" on account of their veneration for that \nunspeakable name. Afterwards in the time of grace the mystery of the \nTrinity was revealed by the Son of God Himself, according to Mt. 28:19: \n\"Going . . . teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the \nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\nIn each state, however, the most excellent revelation was that which was \ngiven first. Now the first revelation, before the Law, was given to \nAbraham, for it was at that time that men began to stray from faith in \none God by turning aside to idolatry, whereas hitherto no such revelation \nwas necessary while all persevered in the worship of one God. A less \nexcellent revelation was made to Isaac, being founded on that which was \nmade to Abraham. Wherefore it was said to him (Gn. 26:24): \"I am the God \nof Abraham thy father,\" and in like manner to Jacob (Gn. 28:13): \"I am \nthe God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac.\" Again in the state \nof the Law the first revelation which was given to Moses was more \nexcellent, and on this revelation all the other revelations to the \nprophets were founded. And so, too, in the time of grace the entire faith \nof the Church is founded on the revelation vouchsafed to the apostles, \nconcerning the faith in one God and three Persons, according to Mt. \n16:18, \"On this rock,\" i.e. of thy confession, \"I will build My Church.\"\nAs to the faith in Christ's incarnation, it is evident that the nearer \nmen were to Christ, whether before or after Him, the more fully, for the \nmost part, were they instructed on this point, and after Him more fully \nthan before, as the Apostle declares (Eph. 3:5).\nAs regards the guidance of human acts, the prophetic  revelation varied \nnot according to the course of time, but according as circumstances \nrequired, because as it is written (Prov. 29:18), \"When prophecy shall \nfail, the people shall be scattered abroad.\" Wherefore at all times men \nwere divinely instructed about what they were to do, according as it was \nexpedient for the spiritual welfare of the elect.",

Wherefore he who is \ncarried away by some external agent, must be carried to something \ndifferent from that to which his inclination tends. This difference \narises in two ways: in one way from the end of the inclination---for \ninstance a stone, which is naturally inclined to be borne downwards, may \nbe thrown upwards; in another way from the manner of tending---for \ninstance a stone may be thrown downwards with greater velocity than \nconsistent with its natural movement.\nAccordingly man's soul also is said to be carried away, in a twofold \nmanner, to that which is contrary to its nature: in one way, as regards \nthe term of transport---as when it is carried away to punishment, \naccording to Ps. 49:22, \"Lest He snatch you away,  and there be none to \ndeliver you\"; in another way, as regards the manner connatural to man, \nwhich is that he should understand the truth through sensible things. \nHence when he is withdrawn from the apprehension of sensibles, he is said \nto be carried away, even though he be uplifted to things whereunto he is \ndirected naturally: provided this be not done intentionally, as when a \nman betakes himself to sleep which is in accordance with nature, \nwherefore sleep cannot be called rapture, properly speaking.\nThis withdrawal, whatever its term may be, may arise from a threefold \ncause. First, from a bodily cause, as happens to those who suffer \nabstraction from the senses through weakness: secondly, by the power of \nthe demons, as in those who are possessed: thirdly, by the power of God. \nIn this last sense we are now speaking of rapture, whereby a man is \nuplifted by the spirit of God to things supernatural, and withdrawn from \nhis senses, according to Ezech. 8:3, \"The spirit lifted me up between the \nearth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem.\"\nIt must be observed, however, that sometimes a person is said to be \ncarried away, not only through being withdrawn from his senses, but also \nthrough being withdrawn from the things to which he was attending, as \nwhen a person's mind wanders contrary to his purpose. But this is to use \nthe expression in a less proper signification.",
        "RP1": "It is natural to man to tend to divine things through the \napprehension of things sensible, according to Rm. 1:20, \"The invisible \nthings of God . . . are clearly seen, being understood by the things that \nare made.\" But the mode, whereby a man is uplifted to divine things and \nwithdrawn from his senses, is not natural to man.",
        "RP2": "It belongs to man's mode and dignity that he be uplifted to \ndivine things, from the very fact that he is made to God's image. And \nsince a divine good infinitely surpasses the faculty of man in order to \nattain that good, he needs the divine assistance which is bestowed on him \nin every gift of grace. Hence it is not contrary to nature, but above the \nfaculty of nature that man's mind be thus uplifted in rapture by God.",
        "RP3": "The saying of Damascene refers to those things which a man \ndoes by himself. But as to those things which are beyond the scope of the \nfree-will, man needs to be uplifted by a stronger operation, which in a \ncertain respect may be called force if we consider the mode of operation, \nbut not if we consider its term to which man is directed both by nature \nand by his intention."

Therefore in those also who are carried up into the heights \nit is the appetite that is affected.",

This happens in two ways, \neither through dread of earthly things or through the mind being rapt in \nheavenly things and forgetful of this lower world.\" Now dread of earthly \nthings pertains to the appetite. Therefore rapture of the mind in \nheavenly things, being placed in opposition to this dread, also pertains \nto the appetite.",
        "CON": "A gloss on Ps. 115:2, \"I said in my excess: Every man \nis a liar,\" says: \"We speak of ecstasy, not when the mind wanders through \nfear, but when it is carried aloft on the wings of revelation.\" Now \nrevelation pertains to the intellective power. Therefore ecstasy or \nrapture does also.",
        "ANS": "We can speak of rapture in two ways. First, with regard \nto the term of rapture, and thus, properly speaking, rapture cannot \npertain to the appetitive, but only to the cognitive power. For it was \nstated (Article [1]) that rapture is outside the inclination of the person who \nis rapt; whereas the movement of the appetitive power is an inclination \nto an appetible good. Wherefore, properly speaking, in desiring \nsomething, a man is not rapt, but is moved by himself.\nSecondly, rapture may be considered with regard to its cause, and thus \nit may have a cause on the part of the appetitive power. For from the \nvery fact that the appetite is strongly affected towards something, it \nmay happen, owing to the violence of his affection, that a man is carried \naway from everything else. Moreover, it has an effect on the appetitive \npower, when for instance a man delights in the things to which he is \nrapt. Hence the Apostle said that he was rapt, not only \"to the third \nheaven\"---which pertains to the contemplation of the intellect---but also \ninto \"paradise,\" which pertains to the appetite.",
        "RP1": "Rapture adds something to ecstasy. For ecstasy means simply \na going out of oneself by being placed outside one's proper order [*Cf. \nFS, Question [28], Article [3]]; while rapture denotes a certain violence in addition. \nAccordingly ecstasy may pertain to the appetitive power, as when a man's \nappetite tends to something  outside him, and in this sense Dionysius \nsays that \"the Divine love causes ecstasy,\" inasmuch as it makes man's \nappetite tend to the object loved. Hence he says afterwards that \"even \nGod Himself, the cause of all things, through the overflow of His loving \ngoodness, goes outside Himself in His providence for all beings.\" But \neven if this were said expressly of rapture, it would merely signify that \nlove is the cause of rapture.",
        "RP2": "There is a twofold appetite in man; to wit, the \nintellective appetite which is called the will, and the sensitive \nappetite known as the sensuality. Now it is proper to man that his lower \nappetite be subject to the higher appetite, and that the higher move the \nlower. Hence man may become outside himself as regards the appetite, in \ntwo ways. In one way, when a man's intellective appetite tends wholly to \ndivine things, and takes no account of those things whereto the sensitive \nappetite inclines him; thus Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"Paul \nbeing in ecstasy through the vehemence of Divine love\" exclaimed: \"I \nlive, now not I, but Christ liveth in me.\"\nIn another way, when a man tends wholly to things pertaining to the \nlower appetite, and takes no account of his higher appetite. It is thus \nthat \"he who fed the swine debased himself\"; and this latter kind of \ngoing out of oneself, or being beside oneself, is more akin than the \nformer to the nature of rapture because the higher appetite is more \nproper to man. Hence when through the violence of his lower appetite a \nman is withdrawn from the movement of his higher appetite, it is more a \ncase of being withdrawn from that which is proper to him. Yet, because \nthere is no violence therein, since the will is able to resist the \npassion, it falls short of the true nature of rapture, unless perchance \nthe passion be so strong that it takes away entirely the use of reason, \nas happens to those who are mad with anger or love.\nIt must be observed. however, that both these excesses affecting the \nappetite may cause an excess in the cognitive power, either because the \nmind is carried away to certain intelligible objects, through being drawn \naway from objects of sense, or because it is caught up into some \nimaginary vision or fanciful apparition.",
        "RP3": "Just as love is a movement of the appetite with regard to \ngood, so fear is a movement of the appetite with regard to evil. \nWherefore either of them may equally cause an aberration of mind; and all \nthe more since fear arises from love, as Augustine says (De Civ.

        "ANS": "The true answer to this question must be gathered from \nthe Apostle's very words, whereby he says he knew something, namely that \nhe was \"rapt even to the third heaven,\" and that something he knew not, \nnamely \"whether\" he were \"in the body or out of the body.\" This may be \nunderstood in two ways. First, the words \"whether in the body or out of \nthe body\" may refer not to the very being of the man who was rapt (as \nthough he knew not whether his soul were in his body or not), but to the \nmode of rapture, so that he ignored whether his body besides his soul, \nor, on the other hand, his soul alone, were rapt to the third heaven. \nThus Ezechiel is stated (Ezech. 8:3) to have been \"brought in the vision \nof God into Jerusalem.\" This was the explanation of a certain Jew \naccording to Jerome (Prolog. super Daniel.), where he says that \"lastly \nour Apostle\" (thus said the Jew) \"durst not assert that he was rapt in \nhis body, but said: 'Whether in the body or out of the body, I know not.'\"\nAugustine, however, disapproves of this explanation (Gen. ad lit. xii, 3 \nseqq.) for this reason that the Apostle states that he knew he was rapt \neven to the third heaven. Wherefore he knew it to be really the third \nheaven to which he was rapt, and not an imaginary likeness of the third \nheaven: otherwise if he gave the name of third heaven to an imaginary \nthird heaven, in the same way he might state that he was rapt in the \nbody, meaning, by body, an image of his body, such as appears in one's \ndreams. Now if he knew it to be really the third heaven, it follows that \neither he knew it to be something spiritual and incorporeal, and then his \nbody could not be rapt thither; or he knew it to be something corporeal, \nand then his soul could not be rapt thither without his body, unless it \nwere separated from his body. Consequently we must explain the matter \notherwise, by saying that the Apostle knew himself to be rapt both in \nsoul and body, but that he ignored how his soul stood in relation to his \nbody, to wit, whether it were accompanied by his body or not.\nHere we find a diversity of opinions. For some say that the Apostle knew \nhis soul to be united to his body as its form, but ignored whether it \nwere abstracted from its senses, or again whether it were abstracted from \nthe operations of the vegetative soul. But he could not but know that it \nwas abstracted from the senses, seeing that he knew himself to be rapt; \nand as to his being abstracted from the operation of the vegetative soul, \nthis was not of such importance as to require him to be so careful in \nmentioning it. It follows, then, that the Apostle ignored whether his \nsoul were united to his body as its form, or separated from it by death. \nSome, however, granting this say that the Apostle did not consider the \nmatter while he was in rapture, because he was wholly intent upon God, \nbut that afterwards he questioned the point, when taking cognizance of \nwhat he had seen. But this also is contrary to the Apostle's words, for \nhe there distinguishes between the past and what happened subsequently, \nsince he states that at the present time he knows that he was rapt \n\"fourteen years ago,\" and that at the present time he knows not \"whether \nhe was in the body or out of the body.\"\nConsequently we must assert that both before and after he ignored \nwhether his soul were separated from his body. Wherefore Augustine (Gen. \nad lit. xii, 5), after discussing the question at length, concludes: \n\"Perhaps then we must infer that he ignored whether, when he was rapt to \nthe third heaven, his soul was in his body (in the same way as the soul \nis in the body, when we speak of a living body either of a waking or of a \nsleeping man, or of one that is withdrawn from his bodily senses during \necstasy), or whether his soul went out of his body altogether, so that \nhis body lay dead.\"",

Cf. Migne, Patr. Lat. tom. CXLI]: \"On this day Thou gavest \nChrist's apostles an unwonted gift, a marvel to all time\": whereas \nprophecy is more pertinent to the Old Testament, according to Heb. 1:1, \n\"God Who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in times past to the \nfathers by the prophets.\" Therefore it would seem that the gift of \ntongues is more excellent than the gift of prophecy.",

Now, by the gift of \ntongues, man is directed to God, whereas by prophecy he is directed to \nman; for it is written (1 Cor. 14:2,3): \"He that speaketh in a tongue, \nspeaketh not unto men, but unto God . . . but he that prophesieth, \nspeaketh unto men unto edification.\" Therefore it would seem that the \ngift of tongues is more excellent than the gift of prophecy.",

        "OB4": "Further, the \"interpretation of speeches\" would seem to be \ncontained under prophecy, because the Scriptures are expounded by the \nsame Spirit from Whom they originated. Now the interpretation of speeches \nis placed after \"divers kinds of tongues\" (1 Cor. 12:10). Therefore it \nseems that the gift of tongues is more excellent than the gift of \nprophecy, particularly as regards a part of the latter.",

        "ANS": "The gift of prophecy surpasses the gift of tongues, in \nthree ways. First, because the gift of tongues regards the utterance of \ncertain words, which signify an intelligible truth, and this again is \nsignified by the phantasms which appear in an imaginary vision; wherefore \nAugustine compares (Gen. ad lit. xii, 8) the gift of tongues to an \nimaginary vision. On the other hand, it has been stated above (Question [173], Article [2]) that the gift of prophecy consists in the mind itself being \nenlightened so as to know an intelligible truth. Wherefore, as the \nprophetic enlightenment is more excellent than the imaginary vision, as \nstated above (Question [174], Article [2]), so also is prophecy more excellent than the \ngift of tongues considered in itself. Secondly, because the gift of \nprophecy regards the knowledge of things, which is more excellent than \nthe knowledge of words, to which the gift of tongues pertains.\nThirdly, because the gift of prophecy is more profitable. The Apostle \nproves this in three ways (1 Cor. 14); first, because prophecy is more \nprofitable to the edification of the Church, for which purpose he that \nspeaketh in tongues profiteth nothing, unless interpretation follow (1 \nCor. 14:4,5). Secondly, as regards the speaker himself, for if he be \nenabled to speak in divers tongues without understanding them, which \npertains to the gift of prophecy, his own mind would not be edified (1 \nCor. 14:7-14). Thirdly, as to unbelievers for whose especial benefit the \ngift of tongues seems to have been given; since perchance they might \nthink those who speak in tongues to be mad (1 Cor. 14:23), for instance \nthe Jews deemed the apostles drunk when the latter spoke in various \ntongues (Acts 2:13): whereas by prophecies the unbeliever is convinced, \nbecause the secrets of his heart are made manifest (Acts 2:25).",

All this is done in the New Testament, according to 1 \nCor. 14:26, \"Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a \ntongue, hath a revelation,\" i.e. a prophetic revelation.",

On the \nother hand, by prophecy a man is directed both to God and to man; \nwherefore it is the more perfect gift.",

        "RP4": "The interpretation of speeches is reducible to the gift of \nprophecy, inasmuch as the mind is enlightened so as to understand and \nexplain any obscurities of speech arising either from a difficulty in the \nthings signified, or from the words uttered being unknown, or from the \nfigures of speech employed, according to Dan. 5:16, \"I have heard of \nthee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult \nthings.\" Hence the interpretation of speeches is more excellent than the \ngift of tongues, as appears from the saying of the Apostle (1 Cor. 14:5), \n\"Greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues; \nunless perhaps he interpret.\" Yet the interpretation of speeches is \nplaced after the gift of tongues, because the interpretation of speeches \nextends even to the interpretation of divers kinds of tongues."

Now the knowledge a man receives \nfrom God cannot be turned to another's profit, except by means of speech. \nAnd since the Holy Ghost does not fail in anything that pertains to the \nprofit of the Church, He provides also the members of the Church with \nspeech; to the effect that a man not only speaks so as to be understood \nby different people, which pertains to the gift of tongues, but also \nspeaks with effect, and this pertains to the grace \"of the word.\"\nThis happens in three ways. First, in order to instruct the intellect, \nand this is the case when a man speaks so as \"to teach.\" Secondly, in \norder to move the affections, so that a man willingly hearkens to the \nword of God. This is the case when a man speaks so as \"to please\" his \nhearers, not indeed with a view to his own favor, but in order to draw \nthem to listen to God's word. Thirdly, in order that men may love that \nwhich is signified by the word, and desire to fulfill it, and this is the \ncase when a man so speaks as \"to sway\" his hearers. In order to effect \nthis the Holy Ghost makes use of the human tongue as of an instrument; \nbut He it is Who perfects the work within.

Both of these can be \ndone by the demons, as stated above (Article [1], ad 2).\nTrue miracles cannot be wrought save by the power of God, because God \nworks them for man's benefit, and this in two ways: in one way for the \nconfirmation of truth declared, in another way in proof of a person's \nholiness, which God desires to propose as an example of virtue. In the \nfirst way miracles can be wrought by any one who preaches the true faith \nand calls upon Christ's name, as even the wicked do sometimes. In this \nway even the wicked can work miracles. Hence Jerome commenting on Mt. \n7:22, \"Have not we prophesied in Thy name?\" says: \"Sometimes prophesying, \nthe working  of miracles, and the casting out of demons are accorded not \nto the merit of those who do these things, but to the invoking of \nChrist's name, that men may honor God, by invoking Whom such great \nmiracles are wrought.\"\nIn the second way miracles are not wrought except by the saints, since \nit is in proof of their holiness that miracles are wrought during their \nlifetime or after death, either by themselves or by others. For we read \n(Acts 19:11,12) that \"God wrought by the hand of Paul . . . miracles\" and \n\"even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs . . . \nand the diseases departed from them.\" In this way indeed there is nothing \nto prevent a sinner from working miracles by invoking a saint; but the \nmiracle is ascribed not to him, but to the one in proof of whose holiness \nsuch things are done.",

Hence Augustine says (Tract. xliv in Joan.) \nthat \"the blind man spoke these words before he was anointed,\" that is, \nbefore he was perfectly enlightened; \"since God does hear sinners.\" When \nit is said that the prayer of one who hears not the law is an \nabomination, this must be understood so far as the sinner's merit is \nconcerned; yet it is sometimes granted, either for the spiritual welfare \nof the one who prays---as the publican was heard (Lk. 18:14)---or for the \ngood of others and for God's glory.",

If they teach a true doctrine, \nsometimes they work true miracles as confirming their teaching, but not \nas an attestation of holiness. Hence Augustine says (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. \n79): \"Magicians work miracles in one way, good Christians in another, \nwicked Christians in another.

Hence Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxix) that \"in the study of \ncreatures we must not exercise an empty and futile curiosity, but should \nmake them the stepping-stone to things unperishable and everlasting.\"\nAccordingly it is clear from what has been said (Articles [1],2,3) that four \nthings pertain, in a certain order, to the contemplative life; first, the \nmoral virtues; secondly, other acts exclusive of contemplation; thirdly, \ncontemplation of the divine effects; fourthly, the complement of all \nwhich is the contemplation of the divine truth itself.",

On the other hand, he \ndescribes the straight movement of the soul as being twofold: first, \"its \nprogress towards things that are near it\"; secondly, \"its uplifting from \nexternal things to simple contemplation.\"  Further, he assigns a \ndifferent oblique movement to each. For he assigns the oblique movement \nof the angels to the fact that \"while providing for those who have less \nthey remain unchanged in relation to God\": whereas he assigns the oblique \nmovement of the soul to the fact that \"the soul is enlightened in Divine \nknowledge by reasoning and discoursing.\" Therefore it would seem that the \noperations of contemplation are unfittingly assigned according to the \nways mentioned above.",

Since, however, it is through \nsensible objects that we come to the knowledge of intelligible things, \nand since sensible operations do not take place without movement, the \nresult is that even intelligible operations are described as movements, \nand are differentiated in likeness to various movements. Now of bodily \nmovements, local movements are the most perfect and come first, as proved \nin Phys. viii, 7; wherefore the foremost among intelligible operations \nare described by being likened to them. These movements are of three \nkinds; for there is the \"circular\" movement, by which a thing moves \nuniformly round one point as center, another is the \"straight\" movement, \nby which a thing goes from one point to another; the third is \"oblique,\" \nbeing composed as it were of both the others. Consequently, in \nintelligible operations, that which is simply uniform is compared to \ncircular movement; the intelligible operation by which one proceeds from \none point to another is compared to the straight movement; while the \nintelligible operation which unites something of uniformity with progress \nto various points is compared to the oblique movement.",

Consequently \nthese movements must be ascribed to souls and angels in different ways, \naccording as they are differently related to  uniformity. For the angelic \nintellect has uniform knowledge in two respects. First, because it does \nnot acquire intelligible truth from the variety of composite objects; \nsecondly, because it understands the truth of intelligible objects not \ndiscursively, but by simple intuition. On the other hand, the intellect \nof the soul acquires intelligible truth from sensible objects, and \nunderstands it by a certain discoursing of the reason.\nWherefore Dionysius assigns the \"circular\" movement of the angels to the \nfact that their intuition of God is uniform and unceasing, having neither \nbeginning nor end: even as a circular movement having neither beginning \nnor end is uniformly around the one same center. But on the part of the \nsoul, ere it arrive at this uniformity, its twofold lack of uniformity \nneeds to be removed. First, that which arises from the variety of \nexternal things: this is removed by the soul withdrawing from externals, \nand so the first thing he mentions regarding the circular movement of the \nsoul is \"the soul's withdrawal into itself from external objects.\" \nSecondly, another lack of uniformity requires to be removed from the \nsoul, and this is owing to the discoursing of reason. This is done by \ndirecting all the soul's operations to the simple contemplation of the \nintelligible truth, and this is indicated by his saying in the second \nplace that \"the soul's intellectual powers must be uniformly \nconcentrated,\" in other words that discoursing must be laid aside and the \nsoul's gaze fixed on the contemplation of the one simple truth. In this \noperation of the soul there is no error, even as there is clearly no \nerror in the understanding of first principles which we know by simple \nintuition. Afterwards these two things being done, he mentions thirdly \nthe uniformity which is like that of the angels, for then all things \nbeing laid aside, the soul continues in the contemplation of God alone. \nThis he expresses by saying: \"Then being thus made uniform unitedly,\" \ni.e. conformably, \"by the union of its powers, it is conducted to the \ngood and the beautiful.\" The \"straight\" movement of the angel cannot \napply to his proceeding from one thing to another by considering them, \nbut only to the order of his providence, namely to the fact that the \nhigher angel enlightens the lower angels through the angels that are \nintermediate. He indicates this when he says: \"The angel's movement takes \na straight line when he proceeds to the care of things subject to him, \ntaking in his course whatever things are direct,\" i.e. in keeping with \nthe dispositions of the direct order. Whereas he ascribes the \"straight\" \nmovement in the soul to the soul's proceeding from exterior sensibles to \nthe knowledge of intelligible objects. The \"oblique\" movement in the \nangels he describes as being composed of the straight and circular \nmovements, inasmuch as their care for those beneath them is in accordance \nwith their contemplation of God: while the \"oblique\" movement in the soul \nhe also declares to be partly straight and partly circular, in so far as \nin reasoning it makes use of the light received from God.",
        "RP3": "These varieties of movement that are taken from the \ndistinction between above and below, right and left, forwards and \nbackwards, and from varying circles, are all comprised under  either \nstraight and oblique movement, because they all denote discursions of \nreason. For if the reason pass from the genus to the species, or from the \npart to the whole, it will be, as he explains, from above to below: if \nfrom one opposite to another, it will be from right to left; if from the \ncause to the effect, it will be backwards and forwards; if it be about \naccidents that surround a thing near at hand or far remote, the movement \nwill be circular. The discoursing of reason from sensible to intelligible \nobjects, if it be according to the order of natural reason, belongs to \nthe straight movement; but if it be according to the Divine \nenlightenment, it will belong to the oblique movement as explained above \n(ad 2). That alone which he describes as immobility belongs to the \ncircular movement.\nWherefore it is evident that Dionysius describes the movement of \ncontemplation with much greater fulness and depth."

        "ANS": "Nothing prevents certain things being more excellent in \nthemselves, whereas they are surpassed by another in some respect. \nAccordingly we must reply that the contemplative life is simply more \nexcellent than the active: and the Philosopher proves this by eight \nreasons (Ethic. x, 7,8). The first is, because the contemplative life \nbecomes man according to that which is best in him, namely the intellect, \nand according to its proper objects, namely things intelligible; whereas \nthe active life is occupied with externals. Hence Rachael, by whom the \ncontemplative life is signified, is interpreted \"the vision of the \nprinciple,\" [*Or rather, 'One seeing the principle,' if derived from \n{rah} and {irzn}; Cf. Jerome, De Nom. Hebr.] whereas as Gregory says \n(Moral. vi, 37) the active life is signified by Lia who was blear-eyed. \nThe second reason is because the contemplative life can be more \ncontinuous, although not as regards the highest degree of contemplation, \nas stated above (Question [180], Article [8], ad 2; Question [181], Article [4], ad 3), wherefore Mary, \nby whom the contemplative life is signified, is described as \"sitting\" \nall the time \"at the Lord's feet.\" Thirdly, because the contemplative \nlife is more delightful than the active; wherefore Augustine says (De \nVerb. Dom. Serm. ciii) that \"Martha was troubled, but Mary feasted.\" \nFourthly, because in the contemplative life man is more self-sufficient, \nsince he needs fewer things for that purpose; wherefore it was said (Lk. 10:41): \"Martha, Martha, thou art careful and art troubled about many \nthings.\" Fifthly, because the contemplative life is loved more for its \nown sake, while the active life is directed to something else. Hence it \nis written (Ps. 36:4): \"One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I \nseek after, that I may dwell in the house of the  Lord all the days of my \nlife, that I may see the delight of the Lord.\" Sixthly, because the \ncontemplative life consists in leisure and rest, according to Ps. 45:11, \n\"Be still and see that I am God.\" Seventhly, because the contemplative \nlife is according to Divine things, whereas active life is according to \nhuman things; wherefore Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. civ): \"'In \nthe beginning was the Word': to Him was Mary hearkening: 'The Word was \nmade flesh': Him was Martha serving.\" Eighthly, because the contemplative \nlife is according to that which is most proper to man, namely his \nintellect; whereas in the works of the active life the lower powers also, \nwhich are common to us and brutes, have their part; wherefore (Ps. 35:7) \nafter the words, \"Men and beasts Thou wilt preserve, O Lord,\" that which \nis special to man is added (Ps. 35:10): \"In Thy light we shall see light.\"\nOur Lord adds a ninth reason (Lk. 10:42) when He says: \"Mary hath chosen \nthe best part, which shall not be taken away from her,\" which words \nAugustine (De Verb. Dom. Serm. ciii) expounds thus: \"Not---Thou hast \nchosen badly but---She has chosen better. Why better? Listen---because it \nshall not be taken away from her. But the burden of necessity shall at \nlength be taken from thee: whereas the sweetness of truth is eternal.\"\nYet in a restricted sense and in a particular case one should prefer the \nactive life on account of the needs of the present life. Thus too the \nPhilosopher says (Topic. iii, 2): \"It is better to be wise than to be \nrich, yet for one who is in need, it is better to be rich . . .\"",
        "RP1": "Not only the active life concerns prelates, they should \nalso excel in the contemplative life; hence Gregory says (Pastor. ii, 1): \n\"A prelate should be foremost in action, more uplifted than others in \ncontemplation.\"",
        "RP2": "The contemplative life consists in a certain liberty of \nmind. For Gregory says (Hom. iii in Ezech.) that \"the contemplative life \nobtains a certain freedom of mind, for it thinks not of temporal but of \neternal things.\" And Boethius says (De Consol. v, 2): \"The soul of man \nmust needs be more free while it continues to gaze on the Divine mind, \nand less so when it stoops to bodily things.\" Wherefore it is evident \nthat the active life does not directly command the contemplative life, \nbut prescribes certain works of the active life as dispositions to the \ncontemplative life; which it accordingly serves rather than commands. \nGregory refers to this when he says (Hom. iii in Ezech.) that \"the active \nlife is bondage, whereas the contemplative life is freedom.\"",
        "RP3": "Sometimes a man is called away from the contemplative life \nto the works of the active life, on account of some necessity of the \npresent life, yet not so as to be compelled to forsake contemplation \naltogether. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): \"The love of \ntruth seeks a holy leisure, the demands of charity undertake an honest \ntoil,\" the work namely of the active life. \"If no one imposes this burden \nupon us we must devote  ourselves to the research and contemplation of \ntruth, but if it be imposed on us, we must bear it because charity \ndemands it of us. Yet even then we must not altogether forsake the \ndelights of truth, lest we deprive ourselves of its sweetness, and this \nburden overwhelm us.\" Hence it is clear that when a person is called from \nthe contemplative life to the active life, this is done by way not of \nsubtraction but of addition."

For merit implies relation to meed; and meed is due to \nlabor, according to 1 Cor. 3:8, \"Every man shall receive his own reward \naccording to his own labor.\" Now labor is ascribed to the active life, \nand rest to the contemplative life; for Gregory says (Hom. xiv in \nEzech.): \"Whosoever is converted to God must first of all sweat from \nlabor, i.e. he must take Lia, that afterwards he may rest in the embraces \nof Rachel so as to see the principle.\" Therefore the active life is of \ngreater merit than the contemplative.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (FS, Question [114], Article [4]), the root of merit is \ncharity; and, while, as stated above (Question [25], Article [1]), charity consists in \nthe love of God and our neighbor, the love of God is by itself more \nmeritorious than the love of our neighbor, as stated above (Question [27], Article [8]). \nWherefore that which pertains more directly to the love of God is \ngenerically more meritorious than that which pertains directly to the \nlove of our neighbor for God's sake. Now the contemplative life pertains \ndirectly and immediately to the love of God; for Augustine says (De Civ. \nDei xix, 19) that \"the  love of\" the Divine \"truth seeks a holy leisure,\" \nnamely of the contemplative life, for it is that truth above all which \nthe contemplative life seeks, as stated above (Question [181], Article [4], ad 2). On \nthe other hand, the active life is more directly concerned with the love \nof our neighbor, because it is \"busy about much serving\" (Lk. 10:40). \nWherefore the contemplative life is generically of greater merit than the \nactive life. This is moreover asserted by Gregory (Hom. iii in Ezech.): \n\"The contemplative life surpasses in merit the active life, because the \nlatter labors under the stress of present work,\" by reason of the \nnecessity of assisting our neighbor, \"while the former with heartfelt \nrelish has a foretaste of the coming rest,\" i.e. the contemplation of God.\nNevertheless it may happen that one man merits more by the works of the \nactive life than another by the works of the contemplative life. For \ninstance through excess of Divine love a man may now and then suffer \nseparation from the sweetness of Divine contemplation for the time being, \nthat God's will may be done and for His glory's sake. Thus the Apostle \nsays (Rm. 9:3): \"I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my \nbrethren\"; which words Chrysostom expounds as follows (De Compunct. i, 7 \n[*Ad Demetr. de Compunct. Cordis.]): \"His mind was so steeped in the love \nof Christ that, although he desired above all to be with Christ, he \ndespised even this, because thus he pleased Christ.\"",

        "RP2": "In the state of future happiness man has arrived at \nperfection, wherefore there is no room for advancement by merit; and if \nthere were, the merit would be more efficacious by reason of the greater \ncharity. But in the present life contemplation is not without some \nimperfection, and can always become more perfect; wherefore it does not \nremove the idea of merit, but causes a yet greater merit on account of \nthe practice of greater Divine charity.",
        "RP3": "A sacrifice is rendered to God spiritually when something \nis offered to Him; and of all man's goods, God specially accepts that of \nthe human soul when it is offered to Him in sacrifice. Now a man ought to \noffer to God, in the first place, his soul, according to Ecclus. 30:24, \n\"Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God\"; in the second place, the souls \nof others, according to Apoc. 22:17, \"He that heareth, let him say: \nCome.\" And the more closely a man unites his own or another's soul to \nGod, the more acceptable is his sacrifice to God; wherefore it is more \nacceptable to God that one apply one's own soul and the souls of others \nto contemplation than to action. Consequently the statement that \"no \nsacrifice is more acceptable to God than zeal for souls,\" does not mean \nthat the merit of the active life is preferable to the merit  of the \ncontemplative life, but that it is more meritorious to offer to God one's \nown soul and the souls of others, than any other external gifts."

For \nthe higher reason which is assigned to contemplation is compared to the \nlower reason which is assigned to action, and the husband is compared to \nhis wife, who should be ruled by her husband, as Augustine says (De Trin. \nxii, 3,7,12).\nSecondly, a thing precedes with regard to us, because it comes first in \nthe order of generation. In this way the active precedes the \ncontemplative life, because it disposes one to it, as stated above (Article [1]; Question [181], Article [1], ad 3); and, in the order of generation, disposition \nprecedes form, although the latter precedes simply and according to its \nnature.",
        "RP1": "The contemplative life is directed to the love of God, not \nof any degree, but to that which is perfect; whereas the active life is \nnecessary for any degree of the love of our neighbor. Hence Gregory says \n(Hom. iii in Ezech.): \"Without the contemplative life it is possible to \nenter the heavenly kingdom, provided one omit not the good actions we are \nable to do; but we cannot enter therein without the active life, if we \nneglect to do the good we can do.\"\nFrom this it is also evident that the active precedes the contemplative \nlife, as that which is common to all precedes, in the order of \ngeneration, that which is proper to the perfect.",
        "RP2": "Progress from the active to the contemplative life is \naccording to the order of generation; whereas the return from the \ncontemplative life to the active is according to the order of direction, \nin so far as the active life is directed by the contemplative. Even thus \nhabit is acquired by acts, and by the acquired habit one acts yet more \nperfectly, as stated in Ethic. ii, 7.",
        "RP3": "He that is prone to yield to his passions on account of his \nimpulse to action is simply more apt for the active life by reason of his \nrestless spirit. Hence Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37) that \"there be some \nso restless that when they are free from labor they labor all the more, \nbecause the more leisure they have for thought, the worse interior \nturmoil they have to bear.\" Others, on the contrary, have the mind \nnaturally pure and restful, so that they are apt for contemplation, and \nif they were to apply themselves wholly to action, this would be \ndetrimental to them. Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. vi, 37) that \"some \nare so slothful of mind that if they chance to have any hard work to do \nthey give way at the very outset.\" Yet, as he adds further on, \"often . . \n. love stimulates slothful souls to work, and fear restrains souls that \nare disturbed in contemplation.\" Consequently those who are more adapted \nto the active life can prepare themselves for the contemplative by the \npractice of the active life; while none the less, those who are more \nadapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of \nthe active life, so as to become yet more apt for contemplation."
