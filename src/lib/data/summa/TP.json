        "question": "Whether it was fitting that God should become incarnate?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that it was not fitting for God to become \nincarnate. Since God from all eternity is the very essence of goodness, \nit was best for Him to be as He had been from all eternity. But from all \neternity He had been without flesh. Therefore it was most fitting for Him \nnot to be united to flesh. Therefore it was not fitting for God to become \nincarnate.",
        "OB2": "Further, it is not fitting to unite things that are  infinitely \napart, even as it would not be a fitting union if one were \"to paint a \nfigure in which the neck of a horse was joined to the head of a man\" \n[*Horace, Ars. Poet., line 1]. But God and flesh are infinitely apart; \nsince God is most simple, and flesh is most composite---especially human \nflesh. Therefore it was not fitting that God should be united to human \nflesh.",
        "OB3": "Further, a body is as distant from the highest spirit as evil is \nfrom the highest good. But it was wholly unfitting that God, Who is the \nhighest good, should assume evil. Therefore it was not fitting that the \nhighest uncreated spirit should assume a body.",
        "OB4": "Further, it is not becoming that He Who surpassed the greatest \nthings should be contained in the least, and He upon Whom rests the care \nof great things should leave them for lesser things. But God---Who takes \ncare of the whole world---the whole universe of things cannot contain. \nTherefore it would seem unfitting that \"He should be hid under the frail \nbody of a babe in swathing bands, in comparison with Whom the whole \nuniverse is accounted as little; and that this Prince should quit His \nthrone for so long, and transfer the government of the whole world to so \nfrail a body,\" as Volusianus writes to Augustine (Ep. cxxxv).",
        "CON": "It would seem most fitting that by visible things the \ninvisible things of God should be made known; for to this end was the \nwhole world made, as is clear from the word of the Apostle (Rm. 1:20): \n\"For the invisible things of God . . . are clearly seen, being understood \nby the things that are made.\" But, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, \n1), by the mystery of the Incarnation are made known at once the \ngoodness, the wisdom, the justice, and the power or might of God---\"His \ngoodness, for He did not despise the weakness of His own handiwork; His \njustice, since, on man's defeat, He caused the tyrant to be overcome by \nnone other than man, and yet He did not snatch men forcibly from death; \nHis wisdom, for He found a suitable discharge for a most heavy debt; His \npower, or infinite might, for there is nothing greater than for God to \nbecome incarnate . . .\"",
        "ANS": "To each things, that is befitting which belongs to it by \nreason of its very nature; thus, to reason befits man, since this belongs \nto him because he is of a rational nature. But the very nature of God is \ngoodness, as is clear from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i). Hence, what belongs \nto the essence of goodness befits God. But it belongs to the essence of \ngoodness to communicate itself to others, as is plain from Dionysius \n(Div. Nom. iv). Hence it belongs to the essence of the highest good to \ncommunicate itself in the highest manner to the creature, and this is \nbrought about chiefly by \"His so joining created nature to Himself that \none Person is made up of these three---the Word, a soul and flesh,\" as \nAugustine says (De Trin. xiii). Hence it is manifest that it was fitting \nthat God should become incarnate.",
        "RP1": "The mystery of the Incarnation was not completed through \nGod being changed in any way from the state in which He had  been from \neternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new \nway, or rather through having united it to Himself. But it is fitting \nthat a creature which by nature is mutable, should not always be in one \nway. And therefore, as the creature began to be, although it had not been \nbefore, so likewise, not having been previously united to God in Person, \nit was afterwards united to Him.",
        "RP2": "To be united to God in unity of person was not fitting to \nhuman flesh, according to its natural endowments, since it was above its \ndignity; nevertheless, it was fitting that God, by reason of His infinite \ngoodness, should unite it to Himself for man's salvation.",
        "RP3": "Every mode of being wherein any creature whatsoever differs \nfrom the Creator has been established by God's wisdom, and is ordained to \nGod's goodness. For God, Who is uncreated, immutable, and incorporeal, \nproduced mutable and corporeal creatures for His own goodness. And so \nalso the evil of punishment was established by God's justice for God's \nglory. But evil of fault is committed by withdrawing from the art of the \nDivine wisdom and from the order of the Divine goodness. And therefore it \ncould be fitting to God to assume a nature created, mutable, corporeal, \nand subject to penalty, but it did not become Him to assume the evil of \nfault.",
        "RP4": "As Augustine replies (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): \"The \nChristian doctrine nowhere holds that God was so joined to human flesh as \neither to desert or lose, or to transfer and as it were, contract within \nthis frail body, the care of governing the universe. This is the thought \nof men unable to see anything but corporeal things . . . God is great not \nin mass, but in might. Hence the greatness of His might feels no straits \nin narrow surroundings. Nor, if the passing word of a man is heard at \nonce by many, and wholly by each, is it incredible that the abiding Word \nof God should be everywhere at once?\" Hence nothing unfitting arises from \nGod becoming incarnate."

        "question": "Whether it was necessary for the restoration of the human race that the Word of God should become incarnate?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that it was not necessary for the reparation of the \nhuman race that the Word of God should become incarnate. For since the \nWord of God is perfect God, as has been said (FP, Question [4], Articles [1],2), no \npower was added to Him by the assumption of flesh. Therefore, if the \nincarnate Word of God restored human nature. He could also have restored \nit without assuming flesh.",
        "OB2": "Further, for the restoration of human nature, which had fallen \nthrough sin, nothing more is required than that man should satisfy for \nsin. Now man can satisfy, as it would seem, for sin; for God cannot \nrequire from man more than man can do, and since He is more inclined to \nbe merciful than to punish, as He lays the act  of sin to man's charge, \nso He ought to credit him with the contrary act. Therefore it was not \nnecessary for the restoration of human nature that the Word of God should \nbecome incarnate.",
        "OB3": "Further, to revere God pertains especially to man's salvation; \nhence it is written (Mal. 1:6): \"If, then, I be a father, where is my \nhonor? and if I be a master, where is my fear?\" But men revere God the \nmore by considering Him as elevated above all, and far beyond man's \nsenses, hence (Ps. 112:4) it is written: \"The Lord is high above all \nnations, and His glory above the heavens\"; and farther on: \"Who is as the \nLord our God?\" which pertains to reverence. Therefore it would seem \nunfitting to man's salvation that God should be made like unto us by \nassuming flesh.",
        "CON": "What frees the human race from perdition is necessary \nfor the salvation of man. But the mystery of the Incarnation is such; \naccording to Jn. 3:16: \"God so loved the world as to give His \nonly-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but \nmay have life everlasting.\" Therefore it was necessary for man's \nsalvation that God should become incarnate.",
        "ANS": "A thing is said to be necessary for a certain end in two \nways. First, when the end cannot be without it; as food is necessary for \nthe preservation of human life. Secondly, when the end is attained better \nand more conveniently, as a horse is necessary for a journey. In the \nfirst way it was not necessary that God should become incarnate for the \nrestoration of human nature. For God with His omnipotent power could have \nrestored human nature in many other ways. But in the second way it was \nnecessary that God should become incarnate for the restoration of human \nnature. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 10): \"We shall also show that \nother ways were not wanting to God, to Whose power all things are equally \nsubject; but that there was not a more fitting way of healing our misery.\"\nNow this may be viewed with respect to our \"furtherance in good.\" First, \nwith regard to faith, which is made more certain by believing God Himself \nWho speaks; hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 2): \"In order that man \nmight journey more trustfully toward the truth, the Truth itself, the Son \nof God, having assumed human nature, established and founded faith.\" \nSecondly, with regard to hope, which is thereby greatly strengthened; \nhence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii): \"Nothing was so necessary for \nraising our hope as to show us how deeply God loved us. And what could \nafford us a stronger proof of this than that the Son of God should become \na partner with us of human nature?\" Thirdly, with regard to charity, \nwhich is greatly enkindled by this; hence Augustine says (De Catech. \nRudib. iv): \"What greater cause is there of the Lord's coming than to \nshow God's love for us?\" And he afterwards adds: \"If we have been slow to \nlove, at least let us hasten to love in return.\" Fourthly, with regard to \nwell-doing, in which He set us an example; hence Augustine says in a \nsermon (xxii de Temp.): \"Man who might be seen was not to be followed; \nbut God was to be followed, Who could not be seen. And therefore God was \nmade man, that He Who  might be seen by man, and Whom man might follow, \nmight be shown to man.\" Fifthly, with regard to the full participation of \nthe Divinity, which is the true bliss of man and end of human life; and \nthis is bestowed upon us by Christ's humanity; for Augustine says in a \nsermon (xiii de Temp.): \"Go was made man, that man might be made God.\"\nSo also was this useful for our \"withdrawal from evil.\" First, because \nman is taught by it not to prefer the devil to himself, nor to honor him \nwho is the author of sin; hence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17): \n\"Since human nature is so united to God as to become one person, let not \nthese proud spirits dare to prefer themselves to man, because they have \nno bodies.\" Secondly, because we are thereby taught how great is man's \ndignity, lest we should sully it with sin; hence Augustine says (De Vera \nRelig. xvi): \"God has proved to us how high a place human nature holds \namongst creatures, inasmuch as He appeared to men as a true man.\" And \nPope Leo says in a sermon on the Nativity (xxi): \"Learn, O Christian, thy \nworth; and being made a partner of the Divine nature, refuse to return by \nevil deeds to your former worthlessness.\" Thirdly, because, \"in order to \ndo away with man's presumption, the grace of God is commended in Jesus \nChrist, though no merits of ours went before,\" as Augustine says (De \nTrin. xiii, 17). Fourthly, because \"man's pride, which is the greatest \nstumbling-block to our clinging to God, can be convinced and cured by \nhumility so great,\" as Augustine says in the same place. Fifthly, in \norder to free man from the thraldom of sin, which, as Augustine says (De \nTrin. xiii, 13), \"ought to be done in such a way that the devil should be \novercome by the justice of the man Jesus Christ,\" and this was done by \nChrist satisfying for us. Now a mere man could not have satisfied for the \nwhole human race, and God was not bound to satisfy; hence it behooved \nJesus Christ to be both God and man. Hence Pope Leo says in the same \nsermon: \"Weakness is assumed by strength, lowliness by majesty, mortality \nby eternity, in order that one and the same Mediator of God and men might \ndie in one and rise in the other---for this was our fitting remedy. \nUnless He was God, He would not have brought a remedy; and unless He was \nman, He would not have set an example.\"\nAnd there are very many other advantages which accrued, above man's \napprehension.",
        "RP1": "This reason has to do with the first kind of necessity, \nwithout which we cannot attain to the end.",
        "RP2": "Satisfaction may be said to be sufficient in two \nways---first, perfectly, inasmuch as it is condign, being adequate to \nmake good the fault committed, and in this way the satisfaction of a mere \nman cannot be sufficient for sin, both because the whole of human nature \nhas been corrupted by sin, whereas the goodness of any person or persons \ncould not be made up adequately for the harm done to the whole of the \nnature; and also because a sin committed against God has a kind of \ninfinity from the infinity of the Divine majesty, because the greater the \nperson we offend, the more  grievous the offense. Hence for condign \nsatisfaction it was necessary that the act of the one satisfying should \nhave an infinite efficiency, as being of God and man. Secondly, man's \nsatisfaction may be termed sufficient, imperfectly---i.e. in the \nacceptation of him who is content with it, even though it is not condign, \nand in this way the satisfaction of a mere man is sufficient. And \nforasmuch as every imperfect presupposes some perfect thing, by which it \nis sustained, hence it is that satisfaction of every mere man has its \nefficiency from the satisfaction of Christ.",
        "RP3": "By taking flesh, God did not lessen His majesty; and in \nconsequence did not lessen the reason for reverencing Him, which is \nincreased by the increase of knowledge of Him. But, on the contrary, \ninasmuch as He wished to draw nigh to us by taking flesh, He greatly drew \nus to know Him."

        "question": "Whether, if man had not sinned, God would have become incarnate?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that if man had not sinned, God would still have \nbecome incarnate. For the cause remaining, the effect also remains. But \nas Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17): \"Many other things are to be \nconsidered in the Incarnation of Christ besides absolution from sin\"; and \nthese were discussed above (Article [2]). Therefore if man had not sinned, God \nwould have become incarnate.",
        "OB2": "Further, it belongs to the omnipotence of the Divine power to \nperfect His works, and to manifest Himself by some infinite effect. But \nno mere creature can be called an infinite effect, since it is finite of \nits very essence. Now, seemingly, in the work of the Incarnation alone is \nan infinite effect of the Divine power manifested in a special manner by \nwhich power things infinitely distant are united, inasmuch as it has been \nbrought about that man is God. And in this work especially the universe \nwould seem to be perfected, inasmuch as the last creature---viz. man---is \nunited to the first principle---viz. God. Therefore, even if man had not \nsinned, God would have become incarnate.",
        "OB3": "Further, human nature has not been made more capable of grace by \nsin. But after sin it is capable of the grace of union, which is the \ngreatest grace. Therefore, if man had not sinned, human nature would have \nbeen capable of this grace; nor would God have withheld from human nature \nany good it was capable of. Therefore, if man had not sinned, God would \nhave become incarnate.",
        "OB4": "Further, God's predestination is eternal. But it is said of \nChrist (Rm. 1:4): \"Who was predestined the Son of God in power.\" \nTherefore, even before sin, it was necessary that the Son of God should \nbecome incarnate, in order to fulfil God's predestination.",
        "OB5": "Further, the mystery of the Incarnation was revealed to the first \nman, as is plain from Gn. 2:23. \"This now is bone of my  bones,\" etc. \nwhich the Apostle says is \"a great sacrament . . . in Christ and in the \nChurch,\" as is plain from Eph. 5:32. But man could not be fore-conscious \nof his fall, for the same reason that the angels could not, as Augustine \nproves (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18). Therefore, even if man had not sinned, God \nwould have become incarnate.\nReply to  Nothing prevents an effect from being revealed to one to \nwhom the cause is not revealed. Hence, the mystery of the Incarnation \ncould be revealed to the first man without his being fore-conscious of \nhis fall. For not everyone who knows the effect knows the cause.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Verb. Apost. viii, 2), expounding \nwhat is set down in Lk. 19:10, \"For the Son of Man is come to seek and to \nsave that which was lost\"; \"Therefore, if man had not sinned, the Son of \nMan would not have come.\" And on 1 Tim. 1:15, \"Christ Jesus came into \nthis world to save sinners,\" a gloss says, \"There was no cause of \nChrist's coming into the world, except to save sinners. Take away \ndiseases, take away wounds, and there is no need of medicine.\"",
        "ANS": "There are different opinions about this question. For \nsome say that even if man had not sinned, the Son of Man would have \nbecome incarnate. Others assert the contrary, and seemingly our assent \nought rather to be given to this opinion.\nFor such things as spring from God's will, and beyond the creature's \ndue, can be made known to us only through being revealed in the Sacred \nScripture, in which the Divine Will is made known to us. Hence, since \neverywhere in the Sacred Scripture the sin of the first man is assigned \nas the reason of the Incarnation, it is more in accordance with this to \nsay that the work of the Incarnation was ordained by God as a remedy for \nsin; so that, had sin not existed, the Incarnation would not have been. \nAnd yet the power of God is not limited to this; even had sin not \nexisted, God could have become incarnate.",
        "RP1": "All the other causes which are assigned in the preceding \narticle have to do with a remedy for sin. For if man had not sinned, he \nwould have been endowed with the light of Divine wisdom, and would have \nbeen perfected by God with the righteousness of justice in order to know \nand carry out everything needful. But because man, on deserting God, had \nstooped to corporeal things, it was necessary that God should take flesh, \nand by corporeal things should afford him the remedy of salvation. Hence, \non Jn. 1:14, \"And the Word was made flesh,\" St. Augustine says (Tract. \nii): \"Flesh had blinded thee, flesh heals thee; for Christ came and \noverthrew the vices of the flesh.\"",
        "RP2": "The infinity of Divine power is shown in the mode of \nproduction of things from nothing. Again, it suffices for the perfection \nof the universe that the creature be ordained in a natural manner to God \nas to an end. But that a creature should be united to God in person \nexceeds the limits of the perfection of nature.",
        "RP3": "A double capability may be remarked in human nature: one, \nin respect of the order of natural power, and this is always fulfilled by \nGod, Who apportions to each according to its  natural capability; the \nother in respect to the order of the Divine power, which all creatures \nimplicitly obey; and the capability we speak of pertains to this. But God \ndoes not fulfil all such capabilities, otherwise God could do only what \nHe has done in creatures, and this is false, as stated above (FP, Question [105], Article [6]). But there is no reason why human nature should not have been \nraised to something greater after sin. For God allows evils to happen in \norder to bring a greater good therefrom; hence it is written (Rm. 5:20): \n\"Where sin abounded, grace did more abound.\" Hence, too, in the blessing \nof the Paschal candle, we say: \"O happy fault, that merited such and so \ngreat a Redeemer!\"",
        "RP4": "Predestination presupposes the foreknowledge of future \nthings; and hence, as God predestines the salvation of anyone to be \nbrought about by the prayers of others, so also He predestined the work \nof the Incarnation to be the remedy of human sin."

        "question": "Whether God became incarnate in order to take away actual sin, rather than to take away original sin?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that God became incarnate as a remedy for actual \nsins rather than for original sin. For the more grievous the sin, the \nmore it runs counter to man's salvation, for which God became incarnate. \nBut actual sin is more grievous than original sin; for the lightest \npunishment is due to original sin, as Augustine says (Contra Julian. v, \n11). Therefore the Incarnation of Christ is chiefly directed to taking \naway actual sins.",
        "OB2": "Further, pain of sense is not due to original sin, but merely \npain of loss, as has been shown (FS, Question [87], Article [5]). But Christ came to \nsuffer the pain of sense on the Cross in satisfaction for sins---and not \nthe pain of loss, for He had no defect of either the beatific vision or \nfruition. Therefore He came in order to take away actual sin rather than \noriginal sin.",
        "OB3": "Further, as Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 3): \"This \nmust be the mind of the faithful servant, to account the benefits of his \nLord, which have been bestowed on all alike, as though they were bestowed \non himself alone. For as if speaking of himself alone, Paul writes to the \nGalatians 2:20: 'Christ . . . loved me and delivered Himself for me.'\" \nBut our individual sins are actual sins; for original sin is the common \nsin. Therefore we ought to have this conviction, so as to believe that He \nhas come chiefly for actual sins.",

        "ANS": "It is certain that Christ came into this world not only \nto take away that sin which is handed on originally to posterity, but \nalso in order to take away all sins subsequently added to it; not that \nall are taken away (and this is from men's fault, inasmuch as they do not \nadhere to Christ, according to Jn. 3:19: \"The light is come into the \nworld, and men loved darkness rather than the light\"), but because He \noffered what was sufficient for blotting out all sins. Hence it is \nwritten (Rm. 5:15-16): \"But not as the offense, so also the gift . . . \nFor judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation, but grace is of many \noffenses unto justification.\"\nMoreover, the more grievous the sin, the more particularly did Christ \ncome to blot it out. But \"greater\" is said in two ways: in one way \n\"intensively,\" as a more intense whiteness is said to be greater, and in \nthis way actual sin is greater than original sin; for it has more of the \nnature of voluntary, as has been shown (FS, Question [81], Article [1]). In another way \na thing is said to be greater \"extensively,\" as whiteness on a greater \nsuperficies is said to be greater; and in this way original sin, whereby \nthe whole human race is infected, is greater than any actual sin, which \nis proper to one person. And in this respect Christ came principally to \ntake away original sin, inasmuch as \"the good of the race is a more \nDivine thing than the good of an individual,\" as is said Ethic. i, 2.",
        "RP1": "This reason looks to the intensive greatness of sin.",
        "RP2": "In the future award the pain of sense will not be meted out \nto original sin. Yet the penalties, such as hunger, thirst, death, and \nthe like, which we suffer sensibly in this life flow from original sin. \nAnd hence Christ, in order to satisfy fully for original sin, wished to \nsuffer sensible pain, that He might consume death and the like in Himself.",
        "RP3": "Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 6): \"The \nApostle used these words, not as if wishing to diminish Christ's gifts, \nample as they are, and spreading throughout the whole world, but that he \nmight account himself alone the occasion of them. For what does it matter \nthat they are given to others, if what are given to you are as complete \nand perfect as if none of them were given to another than yourself?\" And \nhence, although a man ought to account Christ's gifts as given to \nhimself, yet he ought not to consider them not to be given to others. And \nthus we do not exclude that He came to wipe away the sin of the whole \nnature rather than the sin of one person. But the sin of the nature is as \nperfectly healed in each one as if it were healed in him alone. Hence, on \naccount of the union of charity, what is vouchsafed to all ought to be \naccounted his own by each one."

        "OB1": "It would seem that it was fitting that God should become \nincarnate in the beginning of the human race. For the work of the \nIncarnation sprang from the immensity of Divine charity, according to \nEph. 2:4,5: \"But God (Who is rich in mercy), for His exceeding charity \nwherewith He loved us . . . even when we were dead in sins, hath \nquickened us together in Christ.\" But charity does not tarry in bringing \nassistance to a friend who is suffering need, according to Prov. 3:28: \n\"Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give to \nthee, when thou canst give at present.\" Therefore God ought not to have \nput off the work of the Incarnation, but ought thereby to have brought \nrelief to the human race from the beginning.",

Therefore God became incarnate at the most fitting time; and \nit was not fitting that God should become incarnate at the beginning of \nthe human race.",
        "ANS": "Since the work of the Incarnation is principally ordained \nto the restoration of the human race by blotting out sin, it is manifest \nthat it was not fitting for God to become incarnate at the beginning of \nthe human race before sin. For medicine is given only to the sick. Hence \nour Lord Himself says (Mt. 9:12,13): \"They that are in health need not a \nphysician, but they that are ill . . . For I am not come to call the \njust, but sinners.\"\nNor was it fitting that God should become incarnate immediately after \nsin. First, on account of the manner of man's sin, which had come of \npride; hence man was to be liberated in such a manner that he might be \nhumbled, and see how he stood in need of a deliverer. Hence on the words \nin Gal. 3:19, \"Being ordained by  angels in the hand of a mediator,\" a \ngloss says: \"With great wisdom was it so ordered that the Son of Man \nshould not be sent immediately after man's fall. For first of all God \nleft man under the natural law, with the freedom of his will, in order \nthat he might know his natural strength; and when he failed in it, he \nreceived the law; whereupon, by the fault, not of the law, but of his \nnature, the disease gained strength; so that having recognized his \ninfirmity he might cry out for a physician, and beseech the aid of grace.\"\nSecondly, on account of the order of furtherance in good, whereby we \nproceed from imperfection to perfection. Hence the Apostle says (1 Cor. 15:46,47): \"Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is \nnatural; afterwards that which is spiritual . . . The first man was of \nthe earth, earthy; the second man from heaven, heavenly.\"\nThirdly, on account of the dignity of the incarnate Word, for on the \nwords (Gal. 4:4), \"But when the fulness of the time was come,\" a gloss \nsays: \"The greater the judge who was coming, the more numerous was the \nband of heralds who ought to have preceded him.\"\nFourthly, lest the fervor of faith should cool by the length of time, \nfor the charity of many will grow cold at the end of the world. Hence \n(Lk. 18:8) it is written: \"But yet the Son of Man, when He cometh, shall \nHe find think you, faith on earth?\"",
        "RP1": "Charity does not put off bringing assistance to a friend: \nalways bearing in mind the circumstances as well as the state of the \npersons. For if the physician were to give the medicine at the very \noutset of the ailment, it would do less good, and would hurt rather than \nbenefit. And hence the Lord did not bestow upon the human race the remedy \nof the Incarnation in the beginning, lest they should despise it through \npride, if they did not already recognize their disease.",

And this is \nshown first from the union of the Divine and human nature. For, as it has \nbeen said (Article [5], ad 3), perfection precedes imperfection in time in one \nway, and contrariwise in another way imperfection precedes perfection. \nFor in that which is made perfect  from being imperfect, imperfection \nprecedes perfection in time, whereas in that which is the efficient cause \nof perfection, perfection precedes imperfection in time. Now in the work \nof the Incarnation both concur; for by the Incarnation human nature is \nraised to its highest perfection; and in this way it was not becoming \nthat the Incarnation should take place at the beginning of the human \nrace. And the Word incarnate is the efficient cause of the perfection of \nhuman nature, according to Jn. 1:16: \"Of His fulness we have all \nreceived\"; and hence the work of the Incarnation ought not to have been \nput off till the end of the world.

Hence He came when He knew it was fitting to \nsuccor, and when His boons would be welcome. For when by the feebleness \nof the human race men's knowledge of God began to grow dim and their \nmorals lax, He was pleased to choose Abraham as a standard of the \nrestored knowledge of God and of holy living; and later on when reverence \ngrew weaker, He gave the law to Moses in writing; and because the \ngentiles despised it and would not take it upon themselves, and they who \nreceived it would not keep it, being touched with pity, God sent His Son, \nto grant to all remission of their sin and to offer them, justified, to \nGod the Father.\" But if this remedy had been put off till the end of the \nworld, all knowledge and reverence of God and all uprightness of morals \nwould have been swept away from the earth.\nThirdly, this appears fitting to the manifestation of the Divine power, \nwhich has saved men in several ways---not only by faith in some future \nthing, but also by faith in something present and past.",

And although \nyouth and old age cannot be together in a body, yet they can be together \nin a soul, the former on account of quickness, the latter on account of \ngravity.

        "ANS": "To make this question clear we must consider what is \n\"nature.\" Now it is to be observed that the word \"nature\" comes from \nnativity. Hence this word was used first of all to signify the begetting \nof living beings, which is called \"birth\" or \"sprouting forth,\" the word \n\"natura\" meaning, as it were, \"nascitura.\" Afterwards this word \"nature\" \nwas taken to signify the principle of this begetting; and because in \nliving things the principle of generation is an intrinsic principle, this \nword \"nature\" was further employed to signify any intrinsic principle of \nmotion: thus the Philosopher says (Phys. ii) that \"nature is the \nprinciple of motion in that in which it is essentially and not \naccidentally.\" Now this principle is either form or matter. Hence \nsometimes form is called nature, and sometimes matter. And because the \nend of natural generation, in that which is generated, is the essence of \nthe species, which the definition signifies, this essence of the species \nis called the \"nature.\" And thus Boethius defines nature (De Duab. Nat.): \n\"Nature is what informs a thing with its specific difference,\"---i.e. \nwhich perfects the specific definition. But we are now speaking of nature \nas it signifies the essence, or the \"what-it-is,\" or the quiddity of the \nspecies.\nNow, if we take nature in this way, it is impossible that the union of \nthe Incarnate Word took place in the nature. For one thing is made of two \nor more in three ways. First, from two complete things which remain in \ntheir perfection. This can only happen to those whose form is \ncomposition, order, or figure, as a heap is made up of many stones \nbrought together without any order, but solely with juxtaposition; and a \nhouse is made of stones and beams arranged in order, and fashioned to a \nfigure. And in this way some said the union was by manner of confusion \n(which is without order) or by manner of commensuration (which is with \norder). But this cannot be. First, because neither composition nor order \nnor figure is a substantial form, but accidental; and hence it would \nfollow that the union of the Incarnation was not essential, but \naccidental, which will be disproved later on (Article [6]). Secondly, because \nthereby we should not have an absolute unity, but relative only, for \nthere remain several things actually. Thirdly, because the form of such \nis not a nature, but an art, as the form of a house; and thus one nature \nwould not be constituted in Christ, as they wish.\nSecondly, one thing is made up of several things, perfect but changed, \nas a mixture is made up of its elements; and in this way some have said \nthat the union of the Incarnation was brought about by manner of \ncombination. But this cannot be. First, because the Divine Nature is \naltogether immutable, as has been said (FP, Question [9], Articles [1],2), hence neither \ncan it be changed into something else, since it is incorruptible; nor can \nanything else be changed into it, for it cannot be generated. Secondly, \nbecause what is mixed is of the same species with none of the elements; \nfor flesh differs in species from any of its elements. And thus Christ \nwould be of the same nature neither with His Father nor with His Mother. \nThirdly, because there can be no mingling of things widely apart; for the \nspecies of one of them is absorbed, e.g. if we were to put a drop of \nwater in a flagon of wine. And hence, since the Divine Nature infinitely \nexceeds the human nature, there could be no mixture, but the Divine \nNature alone would remain.\nThirdly, a thing is made up of things not mixed nor changed, but \nimperfect; as man is made up of soul and body, and likewise of divers \nmembers. But this cannot be said of the mystery of the Incarnation. \nFirst, because each nature, i.e. the Divine and the human, has its \nspecific perfection. Secondly, because the Divine and human natures \ncannot constitute anything after the manner of quantitative parts, as the \nmembers make up the body; for the Divine Nature is incorporeal; nor after \nthe manner of form and matter, for the Divine Nature cannot be the form \nof anything, especially of anything corporeal, since it would follow that \nthe species resulting therefrom would be communicable to several, and \nthus there would be several Christs. Thirdly, because Christ would exist \nneither in human nature nor in the Divine Nature: since any difference \nvaries the species, as unity varies number, as is said (Metaph. viii, \ntext. 10).",
        "RP1": "This authority of Cyril is expounded in the Fifth Synod \n(i.e. Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 8) thus: \"If anyone proclaiming \none nature of the Word of God to be incarnate does not receive it as the \nFathers taught, viz. that from the Divine and human natures (a union in \nsubsistence having taken place) one Christ results, but endeavors from \nthese words to introduce one nature or substance of the Divinity and \nflesh of Christ, let such a one be anathema.\" Hence the sense is not that \nfrom two natures one results; but that the Nature of the Word of God \nunited flesh to Itself in Person.",

But \nthe comparison is not in this sense, for the Divine Nature cannot be the \nform of a body, as was proved (FP, Question [3], Article [8]).

        "ANS": "Person has a different meaning from \"nature.\" For nature, \nas has been said (Article [1]), designates the specific essence which is \nsignified by the definition. And if nothing was found to be added to what \nbelongs to the notion of the species, there would be no need to \ndistinguish the nature from the suppositum of the nature (which is the \nindividual subsisting in this nature), because every individual \nsubsisting in a nature would be altogether one with its nature. Now in \ncertain subsisting things we happen to find what does not belong to the \nnotion of the species, viz. accidents and individuating principles, which \nappears chiefly in such as are composed of matter and form. Hence in such \nas these the nature and the suppositum really differ; not indeed as if \nthey were wholly separate, but because the suppositum includes the \nnature, and in addition certain other things outside the notion of the \nspecies. Hence the suppositum is taken to be a whole which has the nature \nas  its formal part to perfect it; and consequently in such as are \ncomposed of matter and form the nature is not predicated of the \nsuppositum, for we do not say that this man is his manhood. But if there \nis a thing in which there is nothing outside the species or its nature \n(as in God), the suppositum and the nature are not really distinct in it, \nbut only in our way of thinking, inasmuch it is called \"nature\" as it is \nan essence, and a \"suppositum\" as it is subsisting. And what is said of a \nsuppositum is to be applied to a person in rational or intellectual \ncreatures; for a person is nothing else than \"an individual substance of \nrational nature,\" according to Boethius. Therefore, whatever adheres to a \nperson is united to it in person, whether it belongs to its nature or \nnot. Hence, if the human nature is not united to God the Word in person, \nit is nowise united to Him; and thus belief in the Incarnation is \naltogether done away with, and Christian faith wholly overturned. \nTherefore, inasmuch as the Word has a human nature united to Him, which \ndoes not belong to His Divine Nature, it follows that the union took \nplace in the Person of the Word, and not in the nature.",

        "RP2": "Personality pertains of necessity to the dignity of a \nthing, and to its perfection so far as it pertains to the dignity and \nperfection of that thing to exist by itself (which is understood by the \nword \"person\"). Now it is a greater dignity to exist in something nobler \nthan oneself than to exist by oneself. Hence the human nature of Christ \nhas a greater dignity than ours, from this very fact that in us, being \nexistent by itself, it has its own personality, but in Christ it exists \nin the Person of the Word. Thus to perfect the species belongs to the \ndignity of a form, yet the sensitive part in man, on account of its union \nwith the nobler form which perfects the species, is more noble than in \nbrutes, where it is itself the form which perfects.",
        "RP3": "The Word of God \"did not assume human nature in general, \nbut 'in atomo'\"---that is, in an individual---as Damascene says (De Fide \nOrth. iii, 11) otherwise every man would be the Word of God, even as \nChrist was. Yet we must bear in mind that not every individual in the \ngenus of substance, even in rational nature, is a person, but that alone \nwhich exists by itself, and not that which exists in some more perfect \nthing. Hence the hand of Socrates, although it is a kind of individual, \nis not a person, because it does not exist by itself, but in something \nmore perfect, viz. in the whole. And hence, too, this is signified by a \n\"person\" being defined as \"an individual substance,\" for the hand is not \na complete substance, but part of a substance. Therefore, although this \nhuman nature is a kind of individual in the genus of  substance, it has \nnot its own personality, because it does not exist separately, but in \nsomething more perfect, viz. in the Person of the Word.

        "ANS": "Some who did not know the relation of hypostasis to \nperson, although granting that there is but one person in Christ, held, \nnevertheless, that there is one hypostasis of God and another of man, and \nhence that the union took place in the person and not in the hypostasis. \nNow this, for three reasons, is clearly erroneous. First, because person \nonly adds to hypostasis a determinate nature, viz. rational, according to \nwhat Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.), \"a person is an individual substance \nof rational nature\"; and hence it is the same to attribute to the human \nnature in Christ a proper hypostasis and a proper person. And the holy \nFathers, seeing this, condemned both in the Fifth Council held at \nConstantinople, saying: \"If anyone seeks to introduce into the mystery of \nthe Incarnation two subsistences or two persons, let him be anathema. For \nby the incarnation of one of the Holy Trinity,  God the Word, the Holy \nTrinity received no augment of person or subsistence.\" Now \"subsistence\" \nis the same as the subsisting thing, which is proper to hypostasis, as is \nplain from Boethius (De Duab. Nat.). Secondly, because if it is granted \nthat person adds to hypostasis something in which the union can take \nplace, this something is nothing else than a property pertaining to \ndignity; according as it is said by some that a person is a \"hypostasis \ndistinguished by a property pertaining to dignity.\" If, therefore, the \nunion took place in the person and not in the hypostasis, it follows that \nthe union only took place in regard to some dignity. And this is what \nCyril, with the approval of the Council of Ephesus (part iii, can. 3), \ncondemned in these terms: \"If anyone after the uniting divides the \nsubsistences in the one Christ, only joining them in a union of dignity \nor authority or power, and not rather in a concourse of natural union, \nlet him be anathema.\" Thirdly, because to the hypostasis alone are \nattributed the operations and the natural properties, and whatever \nbelongs to the nature in the concrete; for we say that this man reasons, \nand is risible, and is a rational animal. So likewise this man is said to \nbe a suppositum, because he underlies [supponitur] whatever belongs to \nman and receives its predication. Therefore, if there is any hypostasis \nin Christ besides the hypostasis of the Word, it follows that whatever \npertains to man is verified of some other than the Word, e.g. that He was \nborn of a Virgin, suffered, was crucified, was buried. And this, too, was \ncondemned with the approval of the Council of Ephesus (part iii, can. 4) \nin these words: \"If anyone ascribes to two persons or subsistences such \nwords as are in the evangelical and apostolic Scriptures, or have been \nsaid of Christ by the saints, or by Himself of Himself, and, moreover, \napplies some of them to the man, taken as distinct from the Word of God, \nand some of them (as if they could be used of God alone) only to the Word \nof God the Father, let him be anathema.\" Therefore it is plainly a heresy \ncondemned long since by the Church to say that in Christ there are two \nhypostases, or two supposita, or that the union did not take place in the \nhypostasis or suppositum. Hence in the same Synod (can. 2) it is said: \n\"If anyone does not confess that the Word was united to flesh in \nsubsistence, and that Christ with His flesh is both---to wit, God and \nman---let him be anathema.\"",

But it does not \nhappen in created things that the same numerically can subsist in divers \nessences or natures. Hence just as when we speak of \"otherness\" in regard \nto creatures we do not signify diversity of suppositum, but only \ndiversity of accidental forms, so likewise when Christ is said to be one \nthing or another thing, we do not imply diversity of suppositum or \nhypostasis, but diversity of nature. Hence Gregory Nazianzen says in a \nletter to Chelidonius (Ep. ci): \"In the Saviour we may find one thing and \nanother, yet He is not one person and another.

But this happens in mere men because the soul and \nbody are so united in them as to exist by themselves. But in Christ they \nare united together, so as to be united to something higher, which \nsubsists in the nature composed of them. And hence from the union of the \nsoul and body in Christ a new hypostasis or person does not result, but \nwhat is composed of them is united to the already existing hypostasis or \nPerson. Nor does it therefore follow that the union of the soul and body \nin Christ is of less effect than in us, for its union with something \nnobler does not lessen but increases its virtue and worth; just as the \nsensitive soul in animals constitutes the species, as being considered \nthe ultimate form, yet it does not do so in man, although it is of \ngreater effect and dignity, and this because of its union with a further \nand nobler perfection, viz. the rational soul, as has been said above \n(Article [2], ad 2).",

Now the Son of God did not \nassume human nature as it exists in the pure thought of the intellect, \nsince in this way He would not have assumed human nature in reality, \nunless it be said that human nature is a separate idea, just as the \nPlatonists conceived of man without matter.

        "ANS": "In evidence of this question we must know that two \nheresies have arisen with regard to the mystery of the union of the two \nnatures in Christ. The first confused the natures, as Eutyches and \nDioscorus, who held that from the two natures one nature resulted, so \nthat they confessed Christ to be \"from\" two natures (which were distinct \nbefore the union), but not \"in\" two natures (the distinction of nature \ncoming to an end after the union). The second was the heresy of Nestorius \nand Theodore of Mopsuestia, who separated the persons. For they held the \nPerson of the Son of God to be distinct from the Person of the Son of \nman,  and said these were mutually united: first, \"by indwelling,\" \ninasmuch as the Word of God dwelt in the man, as in a temple; secondly, \n\"by unity of intention,\" inasmuch as the will of the man was always in \nagreement with the will of the Word of God; thirdly, \"by operation,\" \ninasmuch as they said the man was the instrument of the Word of God; \nfourthly, \"by greatness of honor,\" inasmuch as all honor shown to the Son \nof God was equally shown to the Son of man, on account of His union with \nthe Son of God; fifthly, \"by equivocation,\" i.e. communication of names, \ninasmuch as we say that this man is God and the Son of God. Now it is \nplain that these modes imply an accidental union.\nBut some more recent masters, thinking to avoid these heresies, through \nignorance fell into them. For some conceded one person in Christ, but \nmaintained two hypostases, or two supposita, saying that a man, composed \nof body and soul, was from the beginning of his conception assumed by the \nWord of God. And this is the first opinion set down by the Master (Sent. \niii, D, 6). But others desirous of keeping the unity of person, held that \nthe soul of Christ was not united to the body, but that these two were \nmutually separate, and were united to the Word accidentally, so that the \nnumber of persons might not be increased. And this is the third opinion \nwhich the Master sets down (Sent. iii, D, 6).\nBut both of these opinions fall into the heresy of Nestorius; the first, \nindeed, because to maintain two hypostases or supposita in Christ is the \nsame as to maintain two persons, as was shown above (Article [3]). And if stress \nis laid on the word \"person,\" we must have in mind that even Nestorius \nspoke of unity of person on account of the unity of dignity and honor. \nHence the fifth Council (Constantinople II, coll. viii, can. 5) directs \nan anathema against such a one as holds \"one person in dignity, honor and \nadoration, as Theodore and Nestorius foolishly wrote.\" But the other \nopinion falls into the error of Nestorius by maintaining an accidental \nunion. For there is no difference in saying that the Word of God is \nunited to the Man Christ by indwelling, as in His temple (as Nestorius \nsaid), or by putting on man, as a garment, which is the third opinion; \nrather it says something worse than Nestorius---to wit, that the soul and \nbody are not united.\nNow the Catholic faith, holding the mean between the aforesaid \npositions, does not affirm that the union of God and man took place in \nthe essence or nature, nor yet in something accidental, but midway, in a \nsubsistence or hypostasis. Hence in the fifth Council (Constantinople II, \ncoll. viii, can. 5) we read: \"Since the unity may be understood in many \nways, those who follow the impiety of Apollinaris and Eutyches, \nprofessing the destruction of what came together\" (i.e. destroying both \nnatures), \"confess a union by mingling; but the followers of Theodore and \nNestorius, maintaining division, introduce a union of purpose. But the \nHoly Church of God, rejecting the impiety of both these treasons, \nconfesses a union of the Word of God with flesh, by composition, which is \nin subsistence.\" Therefore it is plain that the second of the three \nopinions, mentioned by the Master (Sent. iii, D, 6), which holds  one \nhypostasis of God and man, is not to be called an opinion, but an article \nof Catholic faith. So likewise the first opinion which holds two \nhypostases, and the third which holds an accidental union, are not to be \nstyled opinions, but heresies condemned by the Church in Councils.",

Hence the human nature in Christ is likened to a habit, i.e. \na garment, not indeed in regard to accidental union, but inasmuch as the \nWord is seen by the human nature, as a man by his garment, and also \ninasmuch as the garment is changed, for it is shaped according to the \nfigure of him who puts it on, and yet he is not changed from his form on \naccount of the garment.

But the Word of God from all eternity had complete \nbeing in hypostasis or person; while in time the human nature accrued to \nit, not as if it were assumed unto one being inasmuch as this is of the \nnature (even as the body is assumed to the being of the soul), but to one \nbeing inasmuch as this is of the hypostasis or person. Hence the human \nnature is not accidentally united to the Son of God.",

Now substance, as is \nplain from Metaph. v, 25, is taken in two ways: first, for essence or \nnature; secondly, for suppositum or hypostasis---hence the union having \ntaken place in the hypostasis, is enough to show that it is not an \naccidental union, although the union did not take place in the nature.",
        "RP4": "Not everything that is assumed as an instrument pertains to \nthe hypostasis of the one who assumes, as is plain in the case of a saw \nor a sword; yet nothing prevents what is assumed into the unity of the \nhypostasis from being as an instrument, even as the body of man or his \nmembers. Hence Nestorius held that the human nature was assumed by the \nWord merely as an instrument, and not into the unity of the hypostasis. \nAnd therefore he did not concede that the man was really the Son of God, \nbut His instrument. Hence Cyril says (Epist. ad Monach. Aegyptii): \"The \nScripture does not affirm that this Emmanuel,\" i.e. Christ, \"was assumed \nfor the office of an instrument, but as God truly humanized,\" i.e. made \nman.

Therefore, if we suppose \none Person to assume two human natures, there would be one suppositum of \ntwo natures of the same species; which would seem to imply a \ncontradiction, for the nature of one species is only multiplied by \ndistinct supposita.",

But two human natures \ncannot be wholly united together, inasmuch as the soul of one would be \nunited to the body of the other; and, again, two bodies would be \ntogether, which would give rise to confusion of natures.

For \nit would seem to follow from this that the Personality of the Divine \nNature was so comprehended by one human nature as to be unable to assume \nanother to its Personality; and this is impossible, for the Uncreated \ncannot be comprehended by any creature. Hence it is plain that, whether \nwe consider the Divine Person in regard to His power, which is the \nprinciple of the union, or in regard to His Personality, which is the \nterm of the union, it has to be said that the Divine Person, over and \nbeyond the human nature which He has assumed, can assume another distinct \nhuman nature.",

But in the mystery of the Incarnation the union of form and \nmatter, i.e. of soul and body, does not constitute a new suppositum, as \nwas said above (Article [6]).

But \nthis does not seem to be true; because we must use words according to the \npurpose of their signification, which is in relation to our surroundings. \nConsequently, in order to judge of a word's signification or \nco-signification, we must consider the things which are around us, in \nwhich a word derived from some form is never used in the plural unless \nthere are several supposita. For a man who has on two garments is not \nsaid to be \"two persons clothed,\" but \"one clothed with two garments\"; \nand whoever has two qualities is designated in the singular as \"such by \nreason of the two qualities.\" Now the assumed nature is, as it were, a \ngarment, although this similitude does not fit at all points, as has been \nsaid above (Question [2], Article [6], ad 1). And hence, if the Divine Person were to \nassume two human natures, He would be called, on account of the unity of \nsuppositum, one man having two human natures. Now many men are said to be \none people, inasmuch as they have some one thing in common, and not on \naccount of the unity of suppositum. So likewise, if two Divine Persons \nwere to assume one singular human nature, they would be said to be one \nman, as stated (Article [6], ad 1), not from the unity of suppositum, but \nbecause they have some one thing in common.",

For the Son of God \nis His Godhead, but is not His manhood. And hence, in order that the \nhuman nature may be assumed by the Divine Person, the Divine Nature must \nbe united by a personal union with the whole nature assumed, i.e. in all \nits parts. Now in the two natures assumed there would be a uniform \nrelation to the Divine Person, nor would one assume the other.

And therefore as \ncreatures are established in their proper species, though movably, by the \nparticipation of this likeness, so by the non-participated and personal \nunion of the Word with a creature, it was fitting that the creature \nshould be restored in order to its eternal and unchangeable perfection; \nfor the craftsman by the intelligible form of his art, whereby he \nfashioned his handiwork, restores it when it has fallen into ruin. \nMoreover, He has a particular agreement with human nature, since the Word \nis a concept of the eternal Wisdom, from Whom all man's wisdom is \nderived.

        "ANS": "As Augustine says (De Haeres. 69,55), it was first of all \nthe opinion of Arius and then of Apollinaris that the Son of God assumed \nonly flesh, without a soul, holding that the Word took the place of a \nsoul to the body. And consequently it followed that there were not two \nnatures in Christ, but only one; for from a soul and body one human \nnature is constituted. But this opinion cannot hold, for three reasons. \nFirst, because it is counter to the authority of Scripture, in which our \nLord makes mention of His soul, Mt. 26:38: \"My soul is sorrowful even \nunto death\"; and Jn. 10:18: \"I have power to lay down My soul [animam \nmeam: Douay: 'My life'].\" But to this Apollinaris replied that in these \nwords soul is taken metaphorically, in which way mention is made in the \nOld Testament of the soul of God (Is. 1:14): \"My soul hateth your new \nmoons and your solemnities.\" But, as Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. \n80), the Evangelists relate how Jesus wondered, was angered, sad, and \nhungry. Now these show that He had a true soul, just as that He ate, \nslept and was weary shows that He had a true human body: otherwise, if \nthese things are a metaphor, because the like are said of God in the Old \nTestament, the trustworthiness of the Gospel story is undermined. For it \nis one thing that things  were foretold in a figure, and another that \nhistorical events were related in very truth by the Evangelists. \nSecondly, this error lessens the utility of the Incarnation, which is \nman's liberation. For Augustine [*Vigilius Tapsensis] argues thus (Contra \nFelician. xiii): \"If the Son of God in taking flesh passed over the soul, \neither He knew its sinlessness, and trusted it did not need a remedy; or \nHe considered it unsuitable to Him, and did not bestow on it the boon of \nredemption; or He reckoned it altogether incurable, and was unable to \nheal it; or He cast it off as worthless and seemingly unfit for any use. \nNow two of these reasons imply a blasphemy against God. For how shall we \ncall Him omnipotent, if He is unable to heal what is beyond hope? Or God \nof all, if He has not made our soul. And as regards the other two \nreasons, in one the cause of the soul is ignored, and in the other no \nplace is given to merit. Is He to be considered to understand the cause \nof the soul, Who seeks to separate it from the sin of wilful \ntransgression, enabled as it is to receive the law by the endowment of \nthe habit of reason? Or how can His generosity be known to any one who \nsays it was despised on account of its ignoble sinfulness? If you look at \nits origin, the substance of the soul is more precious than the body: but \nif at the sin of transgression, on account of its intelligence it is \nworse than the body. Now I know and declare that Christ is perfect \nwisdom, nor have I any doubt that He is most loving; and because of the \nfirst of these He did not despise what was better and more capable of \nprudence; and because of the second He protected what was most wounded.\" \nThirdly, this position is against the truth of the Incarnation. For flesh \nand the other parts of man receive their species through the soul.

Hence, wishing to commend the love of God's humility \nto us, the Evangelist mentioned the Word and flesh, leaving the soul on \none side, since it is less than the Word and nobler than flesh.\" Again, \nit was reasonable to mention flesh, which, as being farther away from the \nWord, was less assumable, as it would seem.",

And hence by altogether contemning all riches, Christ \nshowed the highest kind of liberality and magnificence; although He also \nperformed the act of liberality, as far as it became Him, by causing to \nbe distributed to the poor what was given to Himself. Hence, when our \nLord said to Judas (Jn. 13:21), \"That which thou dost do quickly,\" the \ndisciples understood our Lord to have ordered him to give something to \nthe poor. But Christ had no evil desires whatever, as will be shown \n(Question [15], Articles [1],2); yet He was not thereby prevented from having \ntemperance, which is the more perfect in man, as he is without evil \ndesires. Hence, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 9), the \ntemperate man differs from the continent in this---that the temperate has \nnot the evil desires which the continent suffers. Hence, taking \ncontinence in this sense, as the Philosopher takes it, Christ, from the \nvery fact that He had all virtue, had not continence, since it is not a \nvirtue, but something less than virtue."

Secondly it may be viewed in its specific \nnature of grace; and thus the grace of Christ can be termed infinite, \nsince it is not limited, i.e. it has whatsoever can pertain to the nature \nof grace, and what pertains to the nature of grace is not bestowed on Him \nin a fixed measure; seeing that \"according to the purpose\" of God to Whom \nit pertains to measure grace, it is bestowed on Christ's soul as on a \nuniversal principle for bestowing grace on human nature, according to \nEph. 1:5,6, \"He hath graced us in His beloved Son\"; thus we might say \nthat the light of the sun is infinite, not indeed in being, but in the \nnature of light, as having whatever can pertain to the nature of light.",

Hence a gloss says on this text: \"As the Father \nbegot a full and perfect Word, it is united thus full and perfect to \nhuman nature.\" Thirdly, it may be referred to habitual grace, inasmuch as \nthe grace of Christ extends to whatever belongs to grace. Hence Augustine \nexpounding this (Tract. xiv in Joan.) says: \"The division of the gifts is \na measurement.

On the part of the subject, indeed, when the subject reaches the \nutmost limit wherein it partakes of this form, after its own manner, e.g. \nif we say that air cannot increase in heat, when it has reached the \nutmost limit of heat which can exist in the nature of air, although there \nmay be greater heat in actual existence, viz. the heat of fire. But on \nthe part of the form, the possibility of increase is excluded when a \nsubject reaches the utmost perfection which this form can have by nature, \ne.g. if we say the heat of fire cannot be increased because there cannot \nbe a more perfect grade of heat than that to which fire attains. Now the \nproper measure of grace, like that of other forms, is determined by the \nDivine wisdom, according to Wis. 11:21: \"Thou hast ordered all things in \nnumber, weight and measure.\" And it is with reference to its end that a \nmeasure is set to every form. as there is no greater gravity than that of \nthe earth, because there is no lower place than that of the earth. Now \nthe end of grace is the union of the rational creature with God. But \nthere can neither be nor be thought a greater union of the rational \ncreature with God than that which is in the Person. And hence the grace \nof Christ reached the highest measure of grace. Hence it is clear that \nthe grace of Christ cannot be increased on the part of grace. But neither \ncan it be increased on the part of the subject, since Christ as man was a \ntrue and full comprehensor from the first  instant of His conception. \nHence there could have been no increase of grace in Him, as there could \nbe none in the rest of the blessed, whose grace could not increase, \nseeing that they have reached their last end.

        "ANS": "The union of the human nature with the Divine Person, \nwhich, as we have said above (Question [2], Article [10]; Question [6], Article [6]), is the grace of \nunion, precedes the habitual grace of Christ, not in order of time, but \nby nature and in thought; and this for a triple reason: First, with \nreference to the order of the principles of both. For the principle of \nthe union is the Person of the Son assuming human nature, Who is said to \nbe sent into the world, inasmuch as He assumed human nature; but the \nprinciple of habitual grace, which is given with charity, is the Holy \nGhost, Who is said to be sent inasmuch as He dwells in the mind by \ncharity. Now the mission of the Son is prior, in the order of nature, to \nthe mission of the Holy Ghost, even as in the order of nature the Holy \nGhost proceeds from the Son, and love from wisdom. Hence the personal \nunion, according to which the mission of the Son took place, is prior in \nthe order of nature to habitual grace, according to which the mission of \nthe Holy Ghost takes place. Secondly, the reason of this order may be \ntaken from the relation of grace to its cause. For grace is caused in man \nby the presence of the Godhead, as light in the air by the presence of \nthe sun. Hence it is written (Ezech. 43:2): \"The glory of the God of \nIsrael came in by the way of the east . . . and the earth shone with His \nmajesty.\" But the presence of God in Christ is by the union of human \nnature with the Divine Person. Hence the habitual grace of Christ is \nunderstood to follow this union, as light follows the sun. Thirdly, the \nreason of this union can be taken from the end of grace, since it is \nordained to acting rightly, and action belongs to the suppositum and the \nindividual. Hence action and, in consequence, grace ordaining thereto, \npresuppose the hypostasis which operates. Now the hypostasis did not \nexist in the human nature before the union, as is clear from Question [4], Article [2]. \nTherefore the grace of union precedes, in thought, habitual grace.",
        "RP1": "Augustine here means by grace the gratuitous will of God, \nbestowing benefits gratis; and hence every man is said to be made a \nChristian by the same grace whereby a Man became Christ, since both take \nplace by the gratuitous will of God without merits.",
        "RP2": "As disposition in the order of generation precedes the \nperfection to which it disposes, in such things as are gradually \nperfected; so it naturally follows the perfection which one has already \nobtained; as heat, which was a disposition to the  form of fire, is an \neffect flowing from the form of already existing fire. Now the human \nnature in Christ is united to the Person of the Word from the beginning \nwithout succession. Hence habitual grace is not understood to have \npreceded the union, but to have followed it; as a natural property. \nHence, as Augustine says (Enchiridion xl): \"Grace is in a manner natural \nto the Man Christ.\"",
        "RP3": "The common precedes the proper, when both are of the same \ngenus; but when they are of divers genera, there is nothing to prevent \nthe proper being prior to the common. Now the grace of union is not in \nthe same genus as habitual grace; but is above all genera even as the \nDivine Person Himself. Hence there is nothing to prevent this proper from \nbeing before the common since it does not result from something being \nadded to the common, but is rather the principle and source of that which \nis common."

Secondly, \nthere is the infinite as regards matter, which is taken privatively, i.e. \ninasmuch as it has not the form it ought naturally to have, and in this \nway we have infinite in quantity. Now such an infinite of itself, is \nunknown: inasmuch as it is, as it were, matter with privation of form as \nis said Phys. iii, 65. But all knowledge is by form or act.

And in this way it is true that, if we take something from \nit, i.e. taking part after part, there always remains something to be \ntaken. But as material things can be received by the intellect \nimmaterially, and many things unitedly, so can infinite things be \nreceived by the intellect, not after the manner of infinite, but \nfinitely; and thus what are in themselves infinite are, in the intellect \nof the knower, finite. And in this way the soul of Christ knows an \ninfinite number of things, inasmuch as it knows them not by discoursing \nfrom one to another, but in a certain unity, i.e. in any creature in \nwhose potentiality infinite things exist, and principally in the Word \nHimself.",

Now it is a property of the \ninfinite that nothing is greater than it. Hence, if we take one infinite \nline, there is nothing greater in it than the infinite; so, too, if we \ntake any one of other infinite lines, it is plain that each has infinite \nparts. Therefore of necessity in this particular line there is nothing \ngreater than all these infinite parts; yet in another or a third line \nthere will be more infinite parts besides these.

For as His soul was united to the Word above the common mode, in \nunity of person, so above the common manner of men was it filled with \nknowledge and grace by the Word of God Himself; and not by the medium of \nangels, who in their beginning received the knowledge of things by the \ninfluence of the Word, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8).",

Now the active principle of a thing follows its \nform, which is the principle of action. But the form is either the very \nnature of the thing, as in simple things; or is the constituent of the \nnature of the thing; as in such as are composed of matter and form.\nAnd it is in this way that omnipotence flows, so to say, from the Divine \nNature. For since the Divine Nature is the very uncircumscribed Being of \nGod, as is plain from Dionysius (Div. Nom. v), it has an active power \nover everything that can have the nature of being; and this is to have \nomnipotence; just as every other thing has an active power over such \nthings as the perfection of its nature extends to; as what is hot gives \nheat. Therefore since the soul of Christ is a part of human nature, it \ncannot possibly have omnipotence.",

        "RP2": "According to some, knowledge and active power are not in \nthe same ratio; for an active power flows from the very nature of the \nthing, inasmuch as action is considered to come forth from the agent; but \nknowledge is not always possessed by the very essence or form of the \nknower, since it may be had by assimilation of the knower to the thing \nknown by the aid of received species. But this reason seems not to \nsuffice, because even as we may understand by a likeness obtained from \nanother, so also may we act by a form obtained from another, as water or \niron heats, by heat borrowed from fire. Hence there would be no reason \nwhy the soul of Christ, as it can know all things by the similitudes of \nall things  impressed upon it by God, cannot do these things by the same \nsimilitudes.\nIt has, therefore, to be further considered that what is received in the \nlower nature from the higher is possessed in an inferior manner; for heat \nis not received by water in the perfection and strength it had in fire. \nTherefore, since the soul of Christ is of an inferior nature to the \nDivine Nature, the similitudes of things are not received in the soul of \nChrist in the perfection and strength they had in the Divine Nature. And \nhence it is that the knowledge of Christ's soul is inferior to Divine \nknowledge as regards the manner of knowing, for God knows (things) more \nperfectly than the soul of Christ; and also as regards the number of \nthings known, since the soul of Christ does not know all that God can do, \nand these God knows by the knowledge of simple intelligence; although it \nknows all things present, past, and future, which God knows by the \nknowledge of vision. So, too, the similitudes of things infused into \nChrist's soul do not equal the Divine power in acting, i.e. so as to do \nall that God can do, or to do in the same manner as God does, Who acts \nwith an infinite might whereof the creature is not capable. Now there is \nno thing, to know which in some way an infinite power is needed, although \na certain kind of knowledge belongs to an infinite power; yet there are \nthings which can be done only by an infinite power, as creation and the \nlike, as is plain from what has been said in the FP, Question [45]. Hence \nChrist's soul which, being a creature, is finite in might, can know, \nindeed, all things, but not in every way; yet it cannot do all things, \nwhich pertains to the nature of omnipotence; and, amongst other things, \nit is clear it cannot create itself.",
        "RP3": "Christ's soul has practical and speculative knowledge; yet \nit is not necessary that it should have practical knowledge of those \nthings of which it has speculative knowledge. Because for speculative \nknowledge a mere conformity or assimilation of the knower to the thing \nknown suffices; whereas for practical knowledge it is required that the \nforms of the things in the intellect should be operative. Now to have a \nform and to impress this form upon something else is more than merely to \nhave the form; as to be lightsome and to enlighten is more than merely to \nbe lightsome. Hence the soul of Christ has a speculative knowledge of \ncreation (for it knows the mode of God's creation), but it has no \npractical knowledge of this mode, since it has no knowledge operative of \ncreation."

Therefore if we speak of the soul of Christ in \nits proper nature and with its power of nature or of grace, it had power \nto cause those effects proper to a soul (e.g. to rule the body and direct \nhuman acts, and also, by the fulness of grace and knowledge to enlighten \nall rational creatures falling short of its perfection), in a manner \nbefitting a rational creature.

But the transmutation of creatures, \ninasmuch as they may be brought to nothing, corresponds to their \ncreation, whereby they were brought from nothing.

First, as regards the object, since in us \nthese passions very often tend towards what is unlawful, but not so in \nChrist. Secondly, as regards the principle, since these passions in us \nfrequently forestall the judgment of reason; but in Christ all movements \nof the sensitive appetite sprang from the disposition of the reason. \nHence Augustine says (De Civ.

Hence Jerome says (on Mt. 26:37) that \n\"Our Lord, in order to prove the reality of the assumed manhood, 'was \nsorrowful' in very deed; yet lest a passion should hold sway over His \nsoul, it is by a propassion that He is said to have 'begun to grow \nsorrowful and to be sad'\"; so that it is a perfect \"passion\" when it \ndominates the soul, i.e. the reason; and a \"propassion\" when it has its \nbeginning in the sensitive appetite, but goes no further.",

So, too, those who held that Christ's body and soul were \nnot united, could not say that God is true man, but that He is \nfiguratively called man by reason of the parts. Now both these opinions \nwere disproved above (Question [2], Article [5]; Question [5], Article [1]).\nSome, on the contrary, hold the reality on the part of man, but deny the \nreality on the part of God. For they say that Christ, Who is God and man, \nis God not naturally, but by participation, i.e. by grace; even as all \nother holy men are called gods---Christ being more excellently so than \nthe rest, on account of His more abundant grace. And thus, when it is \nsaid that \"God is man,\" God does not stand for the true and natural God. \nAnd this is the heresy of Photinus, which was disproved above (Question [2], Articles [10],11). But some admit this proposition, together with the reality of \nboth terms, holding that Christ is true God and true man; yet they do not \npreserve the truth of the predication. For they say that man is \npredicated of God by reason of a certain conjunction either of dignity, \nor of authority, or of affection or indwelling. It was thus that \nNestorius held God to be man---nothing further being meant than that God \nis joined to man by such a conjunction that man is dwelt in by God, and \nunited to Him in affection, and in a share of the Divine authority and \nhonor. And into the same error fall those who suppose two supposita or \nhypostases in Christ, since it is impossible to understand how, of two \nthings distinct in suppositum or hypostasis, one can be properly \npredicated of the other: unless merely by a figurative expression, \ninasmuch as they are united in something, as if we were to say that Peter \nis John because they are somehow mutually joined together. And these  \nopinions also were disproved above (Question [2], Articles [3],6).\nHence, supposing the truth of the Catholic belief, that the true Divine \nNature is united with true human nature not only in person, but also in \nsuppositum or hypostasis; we say that this proposition is true and \nproper, \"God is man\"---not only by the truth of its terms, i.e. because \nChrist is true God and true man, but by the truth of the predication. For \na word signifying the common nature in the concrete may stand for all \ncontained in the common nature, as this word \"man\" may stand for any \nindividual man. And thus this word \"God,\" from its very mode of \nsignification, may stand for the Person of the Son of God, as was said in \nthe FP, Question [39], Article [4]. Now of every suppositum of any nature we may truly \nand properly predicate a word signifying that nature in the concrete, as \n\"man\" may properly and truly be predicated of Socrates and Plato. Hence, \nsince the Person of the Son of God for Whom this word \"God\" stands, is a \nsuppositum of human nature this word man may be truly and properly \npredicated of this word \"God,\" as it stands for the Person of the Son of \nGod.",

The Nestorians wished to divide words \npredicated of Christ, in this way, viz. that such as pertained to human \nnature should not be predicated of God, and that such as pertained to the \nDivine Nature should not be predicated of the Man. Hence Nestorius said: \n\"If anyone attempt to attribute sufferings to the Word, let him be \nanathema\" [*Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 29]. But if there are any \nwords applicable to both natures, of them they predicated what pertained \nto both natures, as \"Christ\" or \"Lord.\" Hence they granted that Christ \nwas born of a Virgin, and that He was from eternity; but they did not say \nthat God was born of a virgin, or that the Man was from eternity. \nCatholics on the other hand maintained that words which are said of \nChrist either in His Divine or in His human nature may be said either of \nGod or of man. Hence Cyril says [*Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 26]: \n\"If anyone ascribes to two persons or substances,\" i.e. hypostases, \"such \nwords as are in the evangelical and apostolic Scriptures, or have been \nsaid of Christ by the Saints, or by Himself of Himself, and believes that \nsome are to be applied to the Man, and apportions some to the Word \nalone---let him be anathema.\" And the reason of this is that, since there \nis one hypostasis of both natures, the same hypostasis is signified by \nthe name of either nature. Thus whether we say \"man\" or \"God,\" the \nhypostasis of Divine and human nature is signified. And hence, of the Man \nmay be said what belongs to the Divine Nature, as of a hypostasis of the \nDivine Nature; and of God may be said what belongs to the human nature, \nas of a hypostasis of human nature.\nNevertheless, it must be borne in mind that in a proposition in which \nsomething is predicated of another, we must not merely consider what the \npredicate is predicated of, but also the reason of its being predicated. \nThus, although we do not distinguish things predicated of Christ, yet we \ndistinguish that by reason of which they are predicated, since those \nthings that belong to the Divine Nature are predicated of Christ in His \nDivine Nature, and those that belong to the human nature are predicated \nof Christ in His human nature. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. i, 11): \"We \nmust distinguish what is said by Scripture in reference to the form of \nGod, wherein He is equal to the Father, and what in reference to the form \nof a servant, wherein He is less than the Father\": and further on he says \n(De Trin. i, 13): \"The prudent, careful, and devout reader will discern \nthe reason and point of view of what is said.\"",

So, too, Eutyches and all who held one composite nature in Christ \nwere forced to place one will in Him.

For the will, as was said \nin the FS, Question [8], Articles [2],3, regards both the end and the means; and is \naffected differently towards both. For towards the end it is borne simply \nand absolutely, as towards what is good in itself; but towards the means \nit is borne under a certain relation, as the goodness of the means \ndepends on something else.

Thus to heal a leper is a proper \nwork of the Divine operation, but to touch him is the proper work of the \nhuman operation. Now both these operations concur in one work, inasmuch \nas one nature acts in union with the other.",
        "CON": "Ambrose says (De Fide ii, 8): \"How can the same \noperation spring from different powers? Cannot the lesser operate as the \ngreater? And can there be one operation where there are different \nsubstances?\"",
        "ANS": "As was said above (Question [18], Article [1]), the aforesaid  heretics \nwho placed one will in Christ placed one operation in Christ. Now in \norder better to understand their erroneous opinion, we must bear in mind \nthat wherever there are several mutually ordained agents, the inferior is \nmoved by the superior, as in man the body is moved by the soul and the \nlower powers by the reason. And thus the actions and movements of the \ninferior principle are things operated rather than operations. Now what \npertains to the highest principle is properly the operation; thus we say \nof man that to walk, which belongs to the feet, and to touch, which \nbelongs to the hand, are things operated by the man---one of which is \noperated by the soul through the feet, the other through the hands. And \nbecause it is the same soul that operates in both cases, there is only \none indifferent operation, on the part of the thing operating, which is \nthe first moving principle; but difference is found on the part of what \nis operated. Now, as in a mere man the body is moved by the soul, and the \nsensitive by the rational appetite, so in the Lord Jesus Christ the human \nnature is moved and ruled by the Divine. Hence they said that there is \none indifferent operation on the part of the Godhead operating, but \ndivers things operated, inasmuch as the Godhead of Christ did one thing \nby Itself, as to uphold all things by the word of His power---and another \nthing by His human nature, as to walk in body. Hence the Sixth Council \n[*Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 10] quotes the words of Severus \nthe heretic, who said: \"What things were done and wrought by the one \nChrist, differ greatly; for some are becoming to God, and some are human, \nas to walk bodily on the earth is indeed human, but to give hale steps to \nsickly limbs, wholly unable to walk on the ground, is becoming to God. \nYet one, i.e. the Incarnate Word, wrought one and the other---neither was \nthis from one nature, and that from another; nor can we justly affirm \nthat because there are distinct things operated there are therefore two \noperating natures and forms.\"\nBut herein they were deceived, for what is moved by another has a \ntwofold action---one which it has from its own form---the other, which it \nhas inasmuch as it is moved by another; thus the operation of an axe of \nitself is to cleave; but inasmuch as it is moved by the craftsman, its \noperation is to make benches. Hence the operation which belongs to a \nthing by its form is proper to it, nor does it belong to the mover, \nexcept in so far as he makes use of this kind of thing for his work: thus \nto heat is the proper operation of fire, but not of a smith, except in so \nfar as he makes use of fire for heating iron. But the operation which \nbelongs to the thing, as moved by another, is not distinct from the \noperation of the mover; thus to make a bench is not the work of the axe \nindependently of the workman. Hence, wheresoever the mover and the moved \nhave different forms or operative faculties, there must the operation of \nthe mover and the proper operation of the moved be distinct; although the \nmoved shares in the operation of the mover, and the mover makes use of \nthe operation of the moved, and, consequently, each acts in communion \nwith the other.\nTherefore in Christ the human nature has its proper form and power \nwhereby it acts; and so has the Divine. Hence the human  nature has its \nproper operation distinct from the Divine, and conversely. Nevertheless, \nthe Divine Nature makes use of the operation of the human nature, as of \nthe operation of its instrument; and in the same way the human nature \nshares in the operation of the Divine Nature, as an instrument shares in \nthe operation of the principal agent. And this is what Pope Leo says (Ep. \nad Flavian. xxviii): \"Both forms\" (i.e. both the Divine and the human \nnature in Christ) \"do what is proper to each in union with the other, \ni.e. the Word operates what belongs to the Word, and the flesh carries \nout what belongs to flesh.\"\nBut if there were only one operation of the Godhead and manhood in \nChrist, it would be necessary to say either that the human nature had not \nits proper form and power (for this could not possibly be said of the \nDivine), whence it would follow that in Christ there was only the Divine \noperation; or it would be necessary to say that from the Divine and human \npower there was made up one power. Now both of these are impossible. For \nby the first the human nature in Christ is supposed to be imperfect; and \nby the second a confusion of the natures is supposed. Hence it is with \nreason that the Sixth Council (Act. 18) condemned this opinion, and \ndecreed as follows: \"We confess two natural, indivisible, unconvertible, \nunconfused, and inseparable operations in the same Lord Jesus Christ our \ntrue God\"; i.e. the Divine operation and the human operation.",
        "RP1": "Dionysius places in Christ a theandric, i.e. a God-manlike \nor Divino-human, operation not by any confusion of the operations or \npowers of both natures, but inasmuch as His Divine operation employs the \nhuman, and His human operation shares in the power of the Divine. Hence, \nas he says in a certain epistle (Ad Caium iv), \"what is of man He works \nbeyond man; and this is shown by the Virgin conceiving supernaturally and \nby the unstable waters bearing up the weight of bodily feet.\" Now it is \nclear that to be begotten belongs to human nature, and likewise to walk; \nyet both were in Christ supernaturally. So, too, He wrought Divine things \nhumanly, as when He healed the leper with a touch. Hence in the same \nepistle he adds: \"He performed Divine works not as God does, and human \nworks not as man does, but, God having been made man, by a new operation \nof God and man.\"\nNow, that he understood two operations in Christ, one of the Divine and \nthe other of the human nature, is clear from what he says, Div. Nom. ii: \n\"Whatever pertains to His human operation the Father and the Holy Ghost \nno-wise share in, except, as one might say, by their most gracious and \nmerciful will,\" i.e. inasmuch as the Father and the Holy Ghost in their \nmercy wished Christ to do and to suffer human things. And he adds: \"He is \ntruly the unchangeable God, and God's Word by the sublime and unspeakable \noperation of God, which, being made man for us, He wrought.\" Hence it is \nclear that the human operation, in which the Father and the Holy Ghost do \nnot share, except by Their merciful consent, is distinct from His \noperation, as the Word of God, wherein the Father and the Holy Ghost \nshare.",
        "RP2": "The instrument is said to act through being moved by the \nprincipal agent; and yet, besides this, it can have its proper operation \nthrough its own form, as stated above of fire. And hence the action of \nthe instrument as instrument is not distinct from the action of the \nprincipal agent; yet it may have another operation, inasmuch as it is a \nthing. Hence the operation of Christ's human nature, as the instrument of \nthe Godhead, is not distinct from the operation of the Godhead; for the \nsalvation wherewith the manhood of Christ saves us and that wherewith His \nGodhead saves us are not distinct; nevertheless, the human nature in \nChrist, inasmuch as it is a certain nature, has a proper operation \ndistinct from the Divine, as stated above.",

Hence from the diversity of forms or natures spring \nthe divers species of operations, but from the unity of hypostasis \nsprings the numerical unity as regards the operation of the species: thus \nfire has two operations specifically different, namely, to illuminate and \nto heat, from the difference of light and heat, and yet the illumination \nof the fire that illuminates at one and the same time is numerically one. \nSo, likewise, in Christ there are necessarily two specifically different \noperations by reason of His two natures; nevertheless, each of the \noperations at one and the same time is numerically one, as one walking \nand one healing.",
        "RP4": "Being and operation belong to the person by reason of the \nnature; yet in a different manner. For being belongs to the very \nconstitution of the person, and in this respect it has the nature of a \nterm; consequently, unity of person requires unity of the complete and \npersonal being. But operation is an effect of the person by reason of a \nform or nature. Hence plurality of operations is not incompatible with \npersonal unity."

Now if there is any operation \nin man which does not proceed from the reason and the will, it is not \nsimply a human operation, but belongs to man by reason of some part of \nhuman nature---sometimes by reason of the nature of elementary bodies, as \nto be borne downwards---sometimes by reason of the force of the \nvegetative soul, as to be nourished, and to grow---sometimes by reason of \nthe sensitive part, as to see and hear, to imagine and remember, to \ndesire and to be angry. Now between these operations there is a \ndifference. For the operations of the sensitive soul are to some extent \nobedient to reason, and consequently they are somewhat rational and human \ninasmuch as they obey reason, as is clear from the Philosopher (Ethic. i, \n13). But the operations that spring from the vegetative soul, or from the \nnature of elemental bodies, are not subject to reason; consequently they \nare nowise rational; nor simply human, but only as regards a part of \nhuman nature. Now it was said (Article [1]) that when a subordinate agent acts \nby its own form, the operations of the inferior and of the superior agent \nare distinct; but when the inferior agent acts only as moved by the \nsuperior agent, then the operation of the superior and the inferior agent \nis one.\nAnd hence in every mere man the operations of the elemental body and of \nthe vegetative soul are distinct from the will's operation, which is \nproperly human; so likewise the operations of the sensitive soul inasmuch \nas it is not moved by reason; but inasmuch as it is moved by reason, the \noperations of the sensitive and the rational part are the same. Now there \nis but one operation of the rational part if we consider the principle of \nthe operation, which is the reason and the will; but the operations are \nmany if we consider their relationship to various objects. And there were \nsome who called this a diversity of things operated rather than of \noperations, judging the unity of the operation solely from the operative \nprinciple. And it is in this respect that we are now considering the \nunity and plurality of operations in Christ.\nHence in every mere man there is but one operation, which is properly \ncalled human; but besides this there are in a mere man certain other \noperations, which are not strictly human, as was said  above. But in the \nMan Jesus Christ there was no motion of the sensitive part which was not \nordered by reason. Even the natural and bodily operations pertained in \nsome respects to His will, inasmuch as it was His will \"that His flesh \nshould do and suffer what belonged to it,\" as stated above (Question [18], Article [5]). \nMuch more, therefore, is there one operation in Christ, than in any other \nman whatsoever.",

But of whatever good we possess the first cause by \nauthority is God; and in this way no creature has any good of itself, \naccording to 1 Cor. 4:7: \"What hast thou that thou hast not received?\" \nNevertheless, in a secondary manner anyone may be a cause, to himself, of \nhaving certain good things, inasmuch as he cooperates with God in the \nmatter, and thus whoever has anything by his own merit has it, in a \nmanner, of himself. Hence it is better to have a thing by merit than \nwithout merit.\nNow since all perfection and greatness must be attributed to Christ, \nconsequently He must have by merit what others have by merit; unless it \nbe of such a nature that its want would detract from Christ's dignity and \nperfection more than would accrue to Him by merit. Hence He merited \nneither grace nor knowledge nor the beatitude of His soul, nor the \nGodhead, because, since merit regards only what is not yet possessed, it \nwould be necessary that Christ should have been without these at some \ntime; and to be without them would have diminished Christ's dignity more \nthan His merit would have increased it.

Hence when \nit is said that Christ is the master or servant of Himself, or that the \nWord of God is the Master of the Man Christ, this may be understood in \ntwo ways. First, so that this is understood to be said by reason of \nanother hypostasis or person, as if there was the person of the Word of \nGod ruling and the person of the man serving; and this is the heresy of \nNestorius. Hence in the condemnation of Nestorius it is said in the \nCouncil of Ephesus (Part III, ch. i, anath. 6): \"If anyone say that the \nWord begotten of God the Father is the God or Lord of Christ, and does \nnot rather confess the same to be at once God and man as the Word made \nflesh, according to the Scriptures, let him be anathema.\" And in this \nsense it is denied by Cyril and Damascene (Objection [1]); and in the same sense \nmust it be denied that Christ is less than Himself or subject to Himself. \nSecondly, it may be understood of the diversity of natures in the one \nperson or hypostasis. And thus we may say that in one of them, in which \nHe agrees with the Father, He presides and rules together with the \nFather; and in the other nature, in which He agrees with us, He is \nsubject and serves, and in this sense Augustine says that \"the Son is \nless than Himself.\"\nYet it must be borne in mind that since this name \"Christ\" is the name \nof a Person, even as the name \"Son,\" those things can be predicated \nessentially and absolutely of Christ which belong to Him by reason of the \nPerson, Which is eternal; and especially those relations which seem more \nproperly to pertain to the Person or the hypostasis. But whatever \npertains to Him in His human nature is rather to be attributed to Him \nwith a qualification; so that we say that Christ is simply greatest, \nLord, Ruler, whereas to be subject or servant or less is to be attributed \nto Him with the qualification, in His human nature.",

Hence this way a man may be said to be \nsubject and subservient to Himself as regards His different parts.\nTo the other arguments, the reply is clear from what has been said.

Now in us the \nsensuality cannot pray for two reasons; first because the movement of the \nsensuality cannot transcend sensible things, and, consequently, it cannot \nmount to God, which is required for prayer; secondly, because prayer \nimplies a certain ordering inasmuch as we desire something to be \nfulfilled by God; and this is the work of reason alone. Hence prayer is \nan act of the reason, as was said in the SS, Question [83], Article [1].\nSecondly, we may be said to pray according to the sensuality when our \nprayer lays before God what is in our appetite of sensuality; and in this \nsense Christ prayed with His sensuality inasmuch as His prayer expressed \nthe desire of His sensuality, as if it were the advocate of the \nsensuality---and this, that He might teach us three things. First, to \nshow that He had taken a true human nature, with all its natural \naffections: secondly, to show that a man may wish with his natural desire \nwhat God does not wish: thirdly, to show that man should subject his own \nwill to the Divine will. Hence Augustine says in the Enchiridion (Serm. 1 \nin Ps. 32): \"Christ acting as a man, shows the proper will of a man when \nHe says 'Let this chalice pass from Me'; for this was the human will \ndesiring something proper to itself and, so to say, private. But because \nHe wishes man to be righteous and to be directed to God, He adds: \n'Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,' as if to say, 'See thyself \nin Me, for thou canst desire something proper to thee, even though God \nwishes something else.'\"",

For, \nin the first place, our sins were blotted out, according to Rm. 4:25: \n\"Who was delivered up for our sins.\" Secondly, through Him we received \nthe grace of salvation, according to Heb. 5:9: \"He became to all that \nobey Him the cause of eternal salvation.\" Thirdly, through Him we have \nacquired the perfection of glory, according to Heb. 10:19: \"We have \n[Vulg.: 'Having'] a confidence in the entering into the Holies\" (i.e. the \nheavenly glory) \"through His Blood.\" Therefore Christ Himself, as man, \nwas not only priest, but also a perfect victim, being at the same time \nvictim for sin, victim for a peace-offering, and a holocaust.",

Secondly, the slaying of Christ may be considered in \nreference to the will of the Sufferer, Who freely offered Himself to \nsuffering.

Now the priesthood of Christ produces both these \neffects. For by its virtue grace is given to us, by which our hearts are \nturned to God, according to Rm. 3:24,25: \"Being justified freely by His \ngrace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Whom God hath \nproposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood.\" Moreover, He \nsatisfied for us fully, inasmuch as \"He hath borne our infirmities and \ncarried our sorrows\" (Is. 53:4).

For this reason Augustine says (De Trin. iv, \n14): \"So that, since four things are to be observed in every \nsacrifice---to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered, what is \noffered, for whom it is offered; the same one true Mediator reconciling \nus to God by the sacrifice of peace, was one with Him to Whom it was \noffered, united in Himself those for whom He offered it, at the same time \noffered it Himself, and was Himself that which He offered.\"",

The \nSacrifice which is offered every day in the Church is not distinct from \nthat which Christ Himself offered, but is a commemoration thereof. \nWherefore Augustine says (De Civ.

First, for a general reason: for we do not speak of a person's \nnature, but of his person, as being predestinated: because to be \npredestinated is to be directed towards salvation, which belongs to a \nsuppositum acting for the end of beatitude. Secondly, for a special \nreason. Because to be Son of God is not befitting to human nature; for \nthis proposition is false: \"The human nature is the Son of God\": unless \none were to force from it such an exposition as: \"Who was predestinated \nthe Son of God in power\"---that is, \"It was predestinated that the Human \nnature should be united to the Son of God in the Person.\"\nHence we must attribute predestination to the Person of Christ: not, \nindeed, in Himself or as subsisting in the Divine Nature, but as \nsubsisting in the human nature. Wherefore the Apostle, after saying, \"Who \nwas made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh,\" added, \"Who \nwas predestinated the Son of  God in power\": so as to give us to \nunderstand that in respect of His being of the seed of David according to \nthe flesh, He was predestinated the Son of God in power. For although it \nis natural to that Person, considered in Himself, to be the Son of God in \npower, yet this is not natural to Him, considered in the human nature, in \nrespect of which this befits Him according to the grace of union.",
        "RP3": "Origen commenting on Rm. 1:4 says that the true reading of \nthis passage of the Apostle is: \"Who was destined to be the Son of God in \npower\"; so that no antecedence is implied. And so there would be no \ndifficulty. Others refer the antecedence implied in the participle \n\"predestinated,\" not to the fact of being the Son of God, but to the \nmanifestation thereof, according to the customary way of speaking in Holy \nScripture, by which things are said to take place when they are made \nknown; so that the sense would be---\"Christ was predestinated to be made \nknown as the Son of God.\" But this is an improper signification of \npredestination. For a person is properly said to be predestinated by \nreason of his being directed to the end of beatitude: but the beatitude \nof Christ does not depend on our knowledge thereof.\nIt is therefore better to say that the antecedence implied in the \nparticiple \"predestinated\" is to be referred to the Person not in \nHimself, but by reason of the human nature: since, although that Person \nwas the Son of God from eternity, it was not always true that one \nsubsisting in human nature was the Son of God. Hence Augustine says (De \nPraedest. Sanct. xv): \"Jesus was predestinated, so that He Who according \nto the flesh was to be the son of David, should be nevertheless Son of \nGod in power.\"\nMoreover, it must be observed that, although the participle \n\"predestinated,\" just as this participle \"made,\" implies antecedence, yet \nthere is a difference. For \"to be made\" belongs to the thing in itself: \nwhereas \"to be predestinated\" belongs to someone as being in the \napprehension of one who pre-ordains. Now that which is the subject of a \nform or nature in reality, can be apprehended either as under that form \nor absolutely. And since it cannot be said absolutely of the Person of \nChrist that He began to be the Son of God, yet this is becoming to Him as \nunderstood or apprehended to exist in human nature, because at one time \nit began to be true that one existing in human nature was the Son of God; \ntherefore this proposition---\"Christ was predestinated the Son of \nGod\"---is truer than this---\"Christ was made the Son of God.\""

For the honor of \"latria\" is due to God the \nFather Himself on account of His Godhead; and the honor of \"dulia\" on \naccount of the dominion by which He rules over creatures. Wherefore on \nPs. 7:1, \"O Lord my God, in Thee have I hoped,\" a gloss says: \"Lord of \nall by power, to Whom 'dulia' is due: God of all by creation, to Whom \n'latria' is due.\"",

But since, \nas Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 3): \"If by a subtle distinction you \ndivide what is seen from what is understood, it cannot be adored because \nit is a creature\"---that is, with adoration of \"latria.\" And then thus \nunderstood as distinct from the Word of God, it should be adored with the \nadoration of \"dulia\"; not any kind of \"dulia,\" such as is given to other \ncreatures, but with a certain higher adoration, which is called \n\"hyperdulia.\"\nHence appear the answers to the second and third objections. Because the \nadoration of \"latria\" is not given to Christ's humanity in respect of \nitself; but in respect of the Godhead to which it is united, by reason of \nwhich Christ is not less than the Father."

Nom. xii). Now sin cannot be taken \naway except by grace, the subject of which is the rational creature \nalone. Therefore before the infusion of the rational soul, the Blessed \nVirgin was not sanctified.\nSecondly, because, since the rational creature alone can be the subject \nof sin; before the infusion of the rational soul, the offspring conceived \nis not liable to sin.

For Christ did not \ncontract original sin in any way whatever, but was holy in His very \nConception, according to Lk. 1:35: \"The Holy which shall be born of thee, \nshall be called the Son of God.\" But the Blessed Virgin did indeed \ncontract original sin, but was cleansed therefrom before her birth from \nthe womb. This is what is signified (Job 3:9) where it is written of the \nnight of original sin: \"Let it expect light,\" i.e. Christ, \"and not see \nit\"---(because \"no defiled thing cometh into her,\" as is written Wis. \n7:25), \"nor the rising of the dawning of the day,\" that is of the Blessed \nVirgin, who in her birth was immune from original sin.",

Therefore it was unfitting that the fomes \nshould be entirely taken away from her.",

But this can only be understood of purification from the \nfomes: for she committed no sin, as Augustine says (De Nat. et Grat. \nxxvi).

        "ANS": "on this point there are various opinions. For some have \nheld that the fomes was entirely taken away in that sanctification \nwhereby the Blessed Virgin was sanctified in the womb. Others say that it \nremained as far as it causes a difficulty in doing good, but was taken \naway as far as it causes a proneness to evil. Others again, that it was \ntaken away as to the personal corruption, by which it makes us quick to \ndo evil and slow to do good: but that it remained as to the corruption of \nnature, inasmuch as it is the cause of transmitting original sin to the \noffspring. Lastly, others say that, in her first sanctification, the \nfomes remained essentially, but was fettered; and that, when she \nconceived the Son of God, it was entirely taken away. In order to \nunderstand the question at issue, it must be observed that the fomes is \nnothing but a certain inordinate, but habitual, concupiscence of the \nsensitive appetite. for actual concupiscence is a sinful motion. Now \nsensual concupiscence is said to be inordinate, in so far as it rebels \nagainst reason; and this it does by inclining to evil, or hindering from \ngood. Consequently it is essential to the fomes to incline to evil, or \nhinder from good. Wherefore to say that the fomes was in the Blessed \nVirgin without an inclination to evil, is to combine two contradictory \nstatements.\nIn like manner it seems to imply a contradiction to say that the fomes \nremained as to the corruption of nature, but not as to the personal \ncorruption. For, according to Augustine (De Nup. et Concup. i.), it is \nlust that transmits original sin to the offspring. Now lust implies \ninordinate concupiscence, not entirely subject to reason: and therefore, \nif the fomes were entirely taken away as to personal corruption, it could \nnot remain as to the corruption of nature.\nIt remains, therefore, for us to say, either that the fomes was entirely \ntaken away from her by her first sanctification or that it was fettered. \nNow that the fomes was entirely taken away, might be understood in this \nway, that, by the abundance of grace bestowed on the Blessed Virgin, such \na disposition of the soul's powers was granted to her, that the lower \npowers were never moved without the command of her reason: just as we \nhave stated to have been the case with Christ (Question [15], Article [2]), who \ncertainly did not have the fomes of sin; as also was the case with Adam, \nbefore he sinned, by reason of original justice: so that, in this \nrespect, the grace of sanctification in the Virgin had the force of \noriginal justice. And although this appears to be part of the dignity of \nthe Virgin Mother, yet it is somewhat derogatory to the dignity of \nChrist, without whose power no one had been freed from the first sentence \nof condemnation. And though, through faith in Christ, some were freed \nfrom that condemnation, according to the spirit, before Christ's \nIncarnation, yet it does not seem fitting that any one should be freed \nfrom that condemnation, according to the flesh, except after His \nIncarnation, for it was then that immunity from condemnation was first to \nappear. Consequently, just as before the immortality of the flesh of \nChrist rising again, none obtained immortality of the flesh, so it seems \nunfitting to say that before Christ appeared in sinless flesh, His Virgin \nMother's or anyone else's flesh should be without the fomes, which is \ncalled \"the law of the flesh\" or \"of the members\" (Rm. 7:23,25).\nTherefore it seems better to say that by the sanctification in the womb, \nthe Virgin was not freed from the fomes in its essence, but that it \nremained fettered: not indeed by an act of her reason, as in holy men, \nsince she had not the use of reason from the very first moment of her \nexistence in her mother's womb, for this was the singular privilege of \nChrist: but by reason of the abundant grace bestowed on her in her \nsanctification, and still more perfectly by Divine Providence preserving \nher sensitive soul, in a singular manner, from any inordinate movement. \nAfterwards, however, at the conception of Christ's flesh, in which for \nthe first time immunity from sin was to be conspicuous, it is to be \nbelieved that entire freedom from the fomes redounded from the Child to \nthe Mother. This indeed is signified (Ezech. 43:2): \"Behold the glory of \nthe God of Israel came in by the way of the east,\" i.e. by the Blessed \nVirgin, \"and the earth,\" i.e. her flesh, \"shone with His,\" i.e. Christ's, \n\"majesty.\"",

Dionysius, Div. Nom. iv), since even the \nangels are said to be purified, in whom there is no stain, as Dionysius \nsays (Eccl. Hier. vi).

        "ANS": "Augustine (Ep. ad Dardan.) seems to speak dubiously of \ntheir (Jeremias' and John the Baptist's) sanctification in the womb. For \nthe leaping of John in the womb \"might,\" as he says, \"signify the great \ntruth,\" viz. that the woman was the mother of God, \"which was to be made \nknown to his elders, though as yet unknown to the infant. Hence in the \nGospel it is written, not that the infant in her womb believed, but that \nit 'leaped': and our eyes are witness that not only infants leap but also \ncattle. But this was unwonted because it was in the womb. And therefore, \njust as other miracles are wont to be done, this was done divinely, in \nthe infant; not humanly by the infant. Perhaps also in this child the use \nof reason and will was so far accelerated that while yet in his mother's \nwomb he was able to acknowledge, believe, and consent, whereas in other \nchildren we have to wait for these things till they grow older: this \nagain I count as a miraculous result of the divine power.\"\nBut since it is expressly said (of John) in the Gospel that \"he shall be \nfilled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb\"; and of \nJeremias, \"Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee\"; \nit seems that we must needs assert that they were sanctified in the womb, \nalthough, while in the womb, they had not the use of reason (which is the \npoint discussed by Augustine); just as neither do children enjoy the use \nof free will as soon as they are sanctified by baptism.\nNor are we to believe that any others, not mentioned by Scripture, were \nsanctified in the womb. For such privileges of grace, which are bestowed \non some, outside the common law, are ordered for the salvation of others, \naccording to 1 Cor. 12:7: \"The manifestation of the Spirit is given to \nevery man unto profit,\" which would not result from the sanctification of \nanyone unless it were made known to the Church.\nAnd although it is not possible to assign a reason for God's judgments, \nfor instance, why He bestows such a grace on one and not on another, yet \nthere seems to be a certain fittingness in both of these being sanctified \nin the womb, by their foreshadowing the sanctification which was to be \neffected through Christ. First, as to His Passion, according to Heb. \n13:12: \"Jesus, that He might sanctify the people by His own blood, \nsuffered without the gate\": which Passion Jeremias foretold openly by \nwords and by symbols, and most clearly foreshadowed by his own \nsufferings.

For \nsince Christ is the true and natural Son of God, it  was not fitting that \nHe should have another father than God: lest the dignity belonging to God \nbe transferred to another.\nSecondly, this was befitting to a property of the Son Himself, Who is \nsent. For He is the Word of God: and the word is conceived without any \ninterior corruption: indeed, interior corruption is incompatible with \nperfect conception of the word. Since therefore flesh was so assumed by \nthe Word of God, as to be the flesh of the Word of God, it was fitting \nthat it also should be conceived without corruption of the mother.\nThirdly, this was befitting to the dignity of Christ's humanity in which \nthere could be no sin, since by it the sin of the world was taken away, \naccording to Jn. 1:29: \"Behold the Lamb of God\" (i.e. the Lamb without \nstain) \"who taketh away the sin of the world.\" Now it was not possible in \na nature already corrupt, for flesh to be born from sexual intercourse \nwithout incurring the infection of original sin. Whence Augustine says \n(De Nup. et Concup. i): \"In that union,\" viz. the marriage of Mary and \nJoseph, \"the nuptial intercourse alone was lacking: because in sinful \nflesh this could not be without fleshly concupiscence which arises from \nsin, and without which He wished to be conceived, Who was to be without \nsin.\"\nFourthly, on account of the very end of the Incarnation of Christ, which \nwas that men might be born again as sons of God, \"not of the will of the \nflesh, nor of the will of man, but of God\" (Jn. 1:13), i.e. of the power \nof God, of which fact the very conception of Christ was to appear as an \nexemplar. Whence Augustine says (De Sanct.

Wherefore Luke adds (Lk. 3:23): \"Being, \nas it was supposed, the son of Joseph.\"\nOr, according to Augustine (De Cons. Evang. ii), Joseph is called the \nfather of Christ just as \"he is called the husband of Mary, without \nfleshly mingling, by the mere bond of marriage: being thereby united to \nHim much more closely than if he were adopted from another family. \nConsequently that Christ was not begotten of Joseph by fleshly union is \nno reason why Joseph should not be called His father; since he would be \nthe father even of an adopted son not born of his wife.\"",

First, because this was in \nkeeping with a property of Him whose Birth is in question, for He is the \nWord of God. For the word is not only conceived in the mind without \ncorruption, but also proceeds from the mind without corruption. Wherefore \nin order to show that body to be the body of the very Word of God, it was \nfitting that it should be born of a virgin incorrupt. Whence in the \nsermon of the Council of Ephesus (quoted above) we read: \"Whosoever \nbrings forth mere flesh, ceases to be a virgin. But since she gave birth \nto the Word made flesh, God safeguarded her virginity so as to manifest \nHis Word, by which Word He thus manifested Himself: for neither does our \nword, when brought forth, corrupt the mind; nor does God, the substantial \nWord, deigning to be born, destroy virginity.\"\nSecondly, this is fitting as regards the effect of Christ's Incarnation: \nsince He came for this purpose, that He might take away our corruption. \nWherefore it is unfitting that in His Birth He should corrupt His \nMother's virginity. Thus Augustine says in a sermon on the Nativity of \nOur Lord: \"It was not right that He who came to heal corruption, should \nby His advent violate integrity.\"\nThirdly, it was fitting that He Who commanded us to honor our father and \nmother should not in His Birth lessen the honor due to His Mother.",

        "RP2": "Christ wished so to show the reality of His body, as to \nmanifest His Godhead at the same time. For this reason He mingled \nwondrous with lowly things.

        "RP3": "Some have held that Christ, in His Birth, assumed the gift \nof \"subtlety,\" when He came forth from the closed womb of a virgin; and \nthat He assumed the gift of \"agility\" when with dry feet He walked on the \nsea. But this is not consistent with what has been decided above (Question [14]). \nFor these gifts of a glorified body result from an overflow of the soul's \nglory on to the body, as we shall explain further on, in treating of \nglorified bodies (XP, Question [82]): and it has been said above (Question [13], Article [3], ad 1; Question [16], Article [1], ad 2) that before His Passion Christ \"allowed His flesh \nto do and to suffer what was proper to it\" (Damascene, De Fide Orth. \niii): nor was there such an overflow of glory from His soul on to His \nbody.\nWe must therefore say that all these things took place miraculously by \nDivine power. Whence Augustine says (Sup. Joan. Tract. 121): \"To the \nsubstance of a body in which was the Godhead closed doors were no \nobstacle. For truly He had power to enter in by doors not open, in Whose \nBirth His Mother's virginity remained inviolate.\" And Dionysius says in \nan epistle (Ad Caium iv) that \"Christ excelled man in doing that which is \nproper to man: this is shown in His supernatural conception, of a virgin, \nand in the unstable waters bearing the weight of earthly feet.\""

It was therefore fitting that her \nvirginity should be consecrated to God by vow. Nevertheless because, \nwhile the Law was in force both men and women were bound to attend to the \nduty of begetting, since the worship of God was spread according to \ncarnal origin, until Christ was born of that people; the Mother of God is \nnot believed to have taken an absolute vow of virginity, before being \nespoused to Joseph, although she desired to do so, yet yielding her own \nwill to God's judgment. Afterwards, however, having taken a husband, \naccording as the custom of the time required, together with him she took \na vow of virginity.",
        "RP1": "Because it seemed to be forbidden by the law not to take \nthe necessary steps for leaving a posterity on earth, therefore the \nMother of God did not vow virginity absolutely, but under the condition \nthat it were pleasing to God.

        "RP3": "These words of the Apostle are to be understood of those \nwho vow chastity absolutely. Christ's Mother did not do this until she \nwas espoused to Joseph. After her espousals, however, by their common \nconsent she took a vow of virginity together with her spouse."

        "question": "Whether Christ should have been born of an espoused virgin?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that Christ should not have been born of an \nespoused virgin. For espousals are ordered to carnal intercourse. But our \nLord's Mother never wished to have carnal intercourse with her husband; \nbecause this would be derogatory to the virginity of her mind. Therefore \nshe should not have been espoused.",
        "OB2": "Further, that Christ was born of a virgin was miraculous, whence \nAugustine says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii): \"This same power of God brought \nforth the infant's limbs out of the virginal womb of His inviolate \nMother, by which in the vigor of manhood He passed through the closed \ndoors. If we are told why this happened, it will cease to be wonderful; \nif another instance be alleged, it will no longer be unique.\" But \nmiracles that are wrought in confirmation of the Faith should be \nmanifest. Since, therefore, by her Espousals this miracle would be less \nevident, it seems that it was unfitting that Christ should be born of an \nespoused virgin.",
        "OB3": "Further, the martyr Ignatius, as Jerome says on Mt. 1:18, gives \nas a reason of the espousals of the Mother of God, \"that the manner of \nHis Birth might be hidden from the devil, who would think Him to be \nbegotten not of a virgin but of a wife.\" But this seems to be no reason \nat all. First, because by his natural cunning he knows whatever takes \nplace in bodies. Secondly, because later on the demons, through many \nevident signs, knew Christ after a fashion: whence it is written (Mk. \n1:23,24): \"A man with an unclean spirit . . . cried out, saying: What \nhave we to do with Thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art Thou come to destroy us? \nI know . . . Thou art the Holy one of God.\" Therefore it does not seem \nfitting that the Mother of God should have been espoused.",
        "OB4": "Further, Jerome gives as another reason, \"lest the Mother of God \nshould be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress.\" But this reason seems to \nhave no weight, for if she were not espoused, she could not be condemned \nfor adultery. Therefore it does not seem reasonable that Christ should be \nborn of an espoused virgin.",
        "CON": "It is written (Mt. 1:18): \"When as His Mother Mary was \nespoused to Joseph\": and (Lk. 1:26,27): \"The angel Gabriel was sent . . . \nto a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph.\"",
        "ANS": "It was fitting that Christ should be born of an espoused \nvirgin; first, for His own sake; secondly, for His Mother's sake; \nthirdly, for our sake. For the sake of Christ Himself, for four reasons. \nFirst, lest He should be rejected by unbelievers as illegitimate: \nwherefore Ambrose says on Lk. 1:26,27: \"How could we blame Herod or the \nJews if they seem to persecute one who was born of adultery?\"\nSecondly, in order that in the customary way His genealogy might be \ntraced through the male line. Thus Ambrose says on Lk. 3:23: \"He Who came \ninto the world, according to the custom of the world had to be enrolled \nNow for this purpose, it is the men that are required, because they \nrepresent the family in the senate and other courts. The custom of the \nScriptures, too, shows that the ancestry of the men is always traced out.\"\nThirdly, for the safety of the new-born Child: lest the devil should \nplot serious hurt against Him. Hence Ignatius says that she was espoused \n\"that the manner of His Birth might be hidden from the devil.\"\nFourthly, that He might be fostered by Joseph: who is therefore called \nHis \"father,\" as bread-winner.\nIt was also fitting for the sake of the Virgin. First, because thus she \nwas rendered exempt from punishment; that is, \"lest she should be stoned \nby the Jews as an adulteress,\" as Jerome says.\nSecondly, that thus she might be safeguarded from ill fame. Whence \nAmbrose says on Lk. 1:26,27: \"She was espoused lest she be wounded by the \nill-fame of violated virginity, in whom the pregnant womb would betoken \ncorruption.\"\nThirdly, that, as Jerome says, Joseph might administer to her wants.\nThis was fitting, again, for our sake. First, because Joseph is thus a \nwitness to Christ's being born of a virgin. Wherefore Ambrose says: \"Her \nhusband is the more trustworthy witness of her purity, in that he would \ndeplore the dishonor, and avenge the disgrace, were it not that he \nacknowledged the mystery.\"\nSecondly, because thereby the very words of the Virgin are rendered more \ncredible by which she asserted her virginity. Thus Ambrose says: \"Belief \nin Mary's words is strengthened, the motive for a lie is removed. If she \nhad not been espoused when pregnant, she would seem to have wished to \nhide her sin by a lie: being espoused, she had no motive for lying, since \na woman's pregnancy is the reward of marriage and gives grace to the \nnuptial bond.\" These two reasons add strength to our faith.\nThirdly, that all excuse be removed from those virgins who, through want \nof caution, fall into dishonor. Hence Ambrose says: \"It was not becoming \nthat virgins should expose themselves to evil report, and cover \nthemselves with the excuse that the Mother of the Lord had also been \noppressed by ill-fame.\"\nFourthly, because by this the universal Church is typified, which is a \nvirgin and yet is espoused to one Man, Christ, as Augustine says (De \nSanct. Virg. xii).\nA fifth reason may be added: since the Mother of the Lord being both \nespoused and a virgin, both virginity and wedlock are honored in her \nperson, in contradiction to those heretics who disparaged one or the \nother.",
        "RP1": "We must believe that the Blessed Virgin, Mother of God, \ndesired, from an intimate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, to be espoused, \nbeing confident that by the help of God she would never come to have \ncarnal intercourse: yet she left this to God's discretion. Wherefore she \nsuffered nothing in detriment to her virginity.",
        "RP2": "As Ambrose says on Lk. 1:26: \"Our Lord preferred that men \nshould doubt of His origin rather than of His Mother's purity. For he \nknew the delicacy of virgin modesty, and how easily the fair name of \nchastity is disparaged: nor did He choose that our faith in His Birth \nshould be strengthened in detriment to His Mother.\" We must observe, \nhowever, that some miracles wrought by God are the direct object of \nfaith; such are the miracles of the virginal Birth, the Resurrection of \nour Lord, and the Sacrament of the Altar. Wherefore our Lord wished these \nto be more hidden, that belief in them might have greater merit. Whereas \nother miracles are for the strengthening of faith: and these it behooves \nto be manifest.",
        "RP3": "As Augustine says (De Trin. iii), the devil can do many \nthings by his natural power which he is hindered by the Divine power from \ndoing. Thus it may be that by his natural power the devil could know that \nthe Mother of God knew not man, but was a virgin; yet was prevented by \nGod from knowing the manner of the Divine Birth. That afterwards the \ndevil after a fashion knew that He was the Son of God, makes no \ndifficulty: because then the time had already come for Christ to make \nknown His power against the devil, and to suffer persecution aroused by \nhim. But during His infancy it behooved the malice of the devil to be \nwithheld, lest he  should persecute Him too severely: for Christ did not \nwish to suffer such things then, nor to make His power known, but to show \nHimself to be in all things like other infants. Hence Pope Leo (Serm. in \nEpiph. iv) says that \"the Magi found the Child Jesus small in body, \ndependent on others, unable to speak, and in no way differing from the \ngenerality of human infants.\" Ambrose, however, expounding Lk. 1:26, \nseems to understand this of the devil's members. For, after giving the \nabove reason---namely, that the prince of the world might be \ndeceived---he continues thus: \"Yet still more did He deceive the princes \nof the world, since the evil disposition of the demons easily discovers \neven hidden things: but those who spend their lives in worldly vanities \ncan have no acquaintance of Divine things.\"",
        "RP4": "The sentence of adulteresses according to the Law was that \nthey should be stoned, not only if they were already espoused or married, \nbut also if their maidenhood were still under the protection of the \npaternal roof, until the day when they enter the married state. Thus it \nis written (Dt. 22:20,21): \"If . . . virginity be not found in the damsel \n. . . the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die; \nbecause she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her \nfather's house.\"\nIt may also be said, according to some writers, that the Blessed Virgin \nwas of the family or kindred of Aaron, so that she was related to \nElizabeth, as we are told (Lk. 1:36). Now a virgin of the priestly tribe \nwas condemned to death for whoredom; for we read (Lev. 21:9): \"If the \ndaughter of a priest be taken in whoredom, and dishonor the name of her \nfather, she shall be burnt with fire.\"\nLastly, some understand the passage of Jerome to refer to the throwing \nof stones by ill-fame."

Therefore there was no true marriage \nbetween Mary and Joseph.",
        "OB2": "Further, on Mt. 1:16: \"Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary,\" \nJerome says: \"When thou readest 'husband' suspect not a marriage; but \nremember that Scripture is wont to speak of those who are betrothed as \nhusband and wife.\" But a true marriage is not effected by the betrothal, \nbut by the wedding. Therefore, there was no true marriage between the \nBlessed Virgin and Joseph.",
        "OB3": "Further, it is written (Mt. 1:19): \"Joseph, her husband, being a \njust man, and not willing to take her away [*Douay: 'publicly to expose \nher'], i.e. to take her to his home in order to cohabit with her, was \nminded to put her away privately,  i.e. to postpone the wedding,\" as \nRemigius [*Cf. Catena Aurea in Matth.] expounds. Therefore, it seems \nthat, as the wedding was not yet solemnized, there was no true marriage: \nespecially since, after the marriage contract, no one can lawfully put \nhis wife away.",

For by this example the faithful are taught that if \nafter marriage they remain continent by mutual consent, their union is \nstill and is rightly called marriage, even without intercourse of the \nsexes.\"",
        "ANS": "Marriage or wedlock is said to be true by reason of its \nattaining its perfection. Now perfection of anything is twofold; first, \nand second. The first perfection of a thing consists in its very form, \nfrom which it receives its species; while the second perfection of a \nthing consists in its operation, by which in some way a thing attains its \nend. Now the form of matrimony consists in a certain inseparable union of \nsouls, by which husband and wife are pledged by a bond of mutual \naffection that cannot be sundered. And the end of matrimony is the \nbegetting and upbringing of children: the first of which is attained by \nconjugal intercourse; the second by the other duties of husband and wife, \nby which they help one another in rearing their offspring.\nThus we may say, as to the first perfection, that the marriage of the \nVirgin Mother of God and Joseph was absolutely true: because both \nconsented to the nuptial bond, but not expressly to the bond of the \nflesh, save on the condition that it was pleasing to God. For this reason \nthe angel calls Mary the wife of Joseph, saying to him (Mt. 1:20): \"Fear \nnot to take unto thee Mary thy wife\": on which words Augustine says (De \nNup. et Concup. i): \"She is called his wife from the first promise of her \nespousals, whom he had not known nor ever was to know by carnal \nintercourse.\"\nBut as to the second perfection which is attained by the marriage act, \nif this be referred to carnal intercourse, by which children are \nbegotten; thus this marriage was not consummated. Wherefore Ambrose says \non Lk. 1:26,27: \"Be not surprised that Scripture calls Mary a wife. The \nfact of her marriage is declared, not to insinuate the loss of virginity, \nbut to witness to the reality of the union.\" Nevertheless, this marriage \nhad the second perfection, as to upbringing of the child. Thus Augustine \nsays (De Nup. et Concup. i): \"All the nuptial blessings are fulfilled in \nthe marriage of Christ's parents, offspring, faith and sacrament. The \noffspring we know to have been the Lord Jesus; faith, for there was no \nadultery: sacrament, since there was no divorce. Carnal intercourse alone \nthere was none.\"",

Wherefore the words, \"not willing to take her away\" are better \nrendered as meaning, \"not willing publicly to expose her,\" than \nunderstood of taking her to his house. Hence the evangelist adds that \"he \nwas minded to put her away privately.\" But although she had the entry of \nJoseph's house by reason of her first promise of espousals, yet the time \nhad not yet come for the solemnizing of the wedding; for which reason \nthey had not yet consummated the marriage. Therefore, as Chrysostom says \n(Hom. iv in Matth.): \"The evangelist does not say, 'before she was taken \nto the house of her husband,' because she was already in the house. For \nit was the custom among the ancients for espoused maidens to enter \nfrequently the houses of them to whom they were betrothed.\" Therefore the \nangel also said to Joseph: \"Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife\"; \nthat is: \"Fear not to solemnize your marriage with her.\" Others, however, \nsay that she was not yet admitted to his house, but only betrothed to \nhim.

Hier. iv) that \"the angels were the first to be \ntaught the Divine mystery of the loving kindness of Jesus: afterwards the \ngrace of knowledge was imparted to us through them.

Wherefore Bede says in a homily (in Annunt.): \n\"It was an apt beginning of man's restoration that an angel should be \nsent by God to the Virgin who was to be hallowed by the Divine Birth: \nsince the first cause of man's ruin was through the serpent being sent by \nthe devil to cajole the woman by the spirit of pride.\"\nThirdly, because this was becoming to the virginity of the Mother of \nGod.

Wherefore it was becoming that, in order to make \nthis known, an invisible creature should assume a form in which to appear \nvisibly: forasmuch as all the apparitions of the Old Testament are \nordered to that apparition in which the Son of God appeared in the flesh.\nSecondly, it was fitting as regards the dignity of the Mother of God, \nwho was to receive the Son of God not only in her mind, but in her bodily \nwomb. Therefore it behooved not only her mind, but also her bodily senses \nto be refreshed by the angelic vision.\nThirdly, it is in keeping with the certainty of that which was \nannounced. For we apprehend with greater certainty that which is before \nour eyes, than what is in our imagination. Thus Chrysostom says (Hom. iv \nin Matth.) that the angel \"came to the Virgin not in her sleep, but \nvisibly. For since she was receiving from the angel a message exceeding \ngreat, before such an event she needed a vision of great solemnity.\"",

        "RP3": "As Ambrose says on Lk. 1:11: \"We are disturbed, and lose \nour presence of mind, when we are confronted by the presence of a \nsuperior power.\" And this happens not only in bodily, but also in \nimaginary vision. Wherefore it is written (Gn. 15:12) that \"when the sun \nwas setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome \nhorror seized upon him.\" But by being thus disturbed man is not harmed to \nsuch an extent that therefore he ought to forego the vision of an angel. \nFirst because from the very fact that man is raised above himself, in \nwhich matter his dignity is concerned, his inferior powers are weakened; \nand from this results the aforesaid disturbance: thus, also, when the \nnatural heat is drawn within a body, the exterior parts tremble. \nSecondly, because, as Origen says (Hom. iv in Luc.): \"The angel who \nappeared, knowing hers was a human nature, first sought to remedy the \ndisturbance of mind to which a man is subject.\" Wherefore both to Zachary \nand to Mary, as soon as they were disturbed, he said: \"Fear not.\" For \nthis reason, as we read in the life of Anthony, \"it is  difficult to \ndiscern good from evil spirits. For if joy succeed fear, we should know \nthat the help is from the Lord: because security of soul is a sign of \npresent majesty. But if the fear with which we are stricken persevere, it \nis an enemy that we see.\"\nMoreover it was becoming to virginal modesty that the Virgin should be \ntroubled. Because, as Ambrose says on Lk. 1:20: \"It is the part of a \nvirgin to be timid, to fear the advances of men, and to shrink from men's \naddresses.\"\nBut others says that as the Blessed Virgin was accustomed to angelic \nvisions, she was not troubled at seeing this angel, but with wonder at \nhearing what the angel said to her, for she did not think so highly of \nherself. Wherefore the evangelist does not say that she was troubled at \nseeing the angel, but \"at his saying.\""

So therefore we believe that Mary was also \nof the family of David: because we believe the Scriptures, which assert \nboth that Christ was of the seed of David according to the flesh, and \nthat Mary was His Mother, not by sexual intercourse but retaining her \nvirginity.\" For as Jerome says on Mt. 1:18: \"Joseph and Mary were of the \nsame tribe: wherefore he was bound by law to marry her as she was his \nkinswoman.

The last, however, is not mentioned by name, but is \ndesignated through her husband; both on account of his sin, for he was \ncognizant of the adultery and murder; and further in order that, by \nmentioning the husband by name, David's sin might be recalled. And \nbecause Luke purposes to delineate Christ as the expiator of our sins, he \nmakes no mention of these women. But he does mention Juda's brethren, in \norder to show that they belong to God's people: whereas Ismael, the \nbrother of Isaac, and Esau, Jacob's brother, were cut off from God's \npeople, and for this reason are not mentioned in Christ's genealogy. \nAnother motive was to show the emptiness of pride of birth: for many of \nJuda's brethren were born of hand-maidens, and yet all were patriarchs \nand heads of tribes. Phares and Zara are mentioned together, because, as \nAmbrose says on Lk. 3:23, \"they are the type of the twofold life of man: \none, according to the Law,\" signified by Zara; \"the other by Faith,\" of \nwhich Phares is the type.

But \nthis will not stand: because Matthew mentions one of David's \nsons---namely, Solomon; whereas Luke mentions another---namely, Nathan, \nwho according to the history of the kings (2 Kgs. 5:14) were clearly \nbrothers.\nWherefore others said that Matthew gave the true genealogy of Christ: \nwhile Luke gave the supposititious genealogy; hence he began: \"Being (as \nit was supposed) the son of Joseph.\" For among the Jews there were some \nwho believed that, on account of the crimes of the kings of Juda, Christ \nwould be born of the family of David, not through the kings, but through \nsome other line of private individuals.\nOthers again have supposed that Matthew gave the forefathers according \nto the flesh: whereas Luke gave these according to the spirit, that is, \nrighteous men, who are called (Christ's) forefathers by likeness of \nvirtue.\nBut an answer is given in the Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. [*Part i, qu. lvi; \npart 2, qu. vi] to the effect that we are not to understand that Joseph \nis said by Luke to be the son of Heli: but that at the time of Christ, \nHeli and Joseph were differently descended from David. Hence Christ is \nsaid to have been supposed to be the son of Joseph, and also to have been \nthe son of Heli as though (the Evangelist) were to say that Christ, from \nthe fact that He was the son of Joseph, could be called the son of Heli \nand of all those who were descended from David; as the Apostle says (Rm. 9:5): \"Of whom\" (viz. the Jews) \"is Christ according to the flesh.\"\nAugustine again gives three solutions (De Qq. Evang. ii), saying: \"There \nare three motives by one or other of which the  evangelist was guided. \nFor either one evangelist mentions Joseph's father of whom he was \nbegotten; whilst the other gives either his maternal grandfather or some \nother of his later forefathers; or one was Joseph's natural father: the \nother is father by adoption. Or, according to the Jewish custom, one of \nthose having died without children, a near relation of his married his \nwife, the son born of the latter union being reckoned as the son of the \nformer\": which is a kind of legal adoption, as Augustine himself says (De \nConsensu Evang. ii, Cf. Retract. ii).\nThis last motive is the truest: Jerome also gives it commenting on Mt. \n1:16; and Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church history (I, vii), says that \nit is given by Africanus the historian. For these writers says that \nMathan and Melchi, at different times, each begot a son of one and the \nsame wife, named Estha. For Mathan, who traced his descent through \nSolomon, had married her first, and died, leaving one son, whose name was \nJacob: and after his death, as the law did not forbid his widow to \nremarry, Melchi, who traced his descent through Mathan, being of the same \ntribe though not of the same family as Mathan, married his widow, who \nbore him a son, called Heli; so that Jacob and Heli were uterine brothers \nborn to different fathers. Now one of these, Jacob, on his brother Heli \ndying without issue, married the latter's widow, according to the \nprescription of the law, of whom he had a son, Joseph, who by nature was \nhis own son, but by law was accounted the son of Heli. Wherefore Matthew \nsays \"Jacob begot Joseph\": whereas Luke, who was giving the legal \ngenealogy, speaks of no one as begetting.\nAnd although Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv) says that the Blessed Virgin \nMary was connected with Joseph in as far as Heli was accounted as his \nfather, for he says that she was descended from Melchi: yet must we also \nbelieve that she was in some way descended from Solomon through those \npatriarchs enumerated by Matthew, who is said to have set down Christ's \ngenealogy according to the flesh; and all the more since Ambrose states \nthat Christ was of the seed of Jechonias.",
        "RP3": "According to Augustine (De Consensu Evang. ii) \"Matthew \npurposed to delineate the royal personality of Christ; Luke the priestly \npersonality: so that in Matthew's genealogy is signified the assumption \nof our sins by our Lord Jesus Christ\": inasmuch as by his carnal origin \n\"He assumed 'the likeness of sinful flesh.' But in Luke's genealogy the \nwashing away of our sins is signified,\" which is effected by Christ's \nsacrifice. \"For which reason Matthew traces the generations downwards, \nLuke upwards.\" For the same reason too \"Matthew descends from David \nthrough Solomon, in whose mother David sinned; whereas Luke ascends to \nDavid through Nathan, through whose namesake, the prophet, God expiated \nhis sin.\" And hence it is also that, because \"Matthew wished to signify \nthat Christ had condescended to our mortal nature, he set down the \ngenealogy of Christ at the very outset of his Gospel, beginning with \nAbraham and descending to Joseph and the birth of Christ Himself. Luke, \non the contrary, sets forth Christ's genealogy not at the outset, but \nafter Christ's Baptism, and not in the  descending but in the ascending \norder: as though giving prominence to the office of the priest in \nexpiating our sins, to which John bore witness, saying: 'Behold Him who \ntaketh away the sin of the world.' And in the ascending order, he passes \nAbraham and continues up to God, to whom we are reconciled by cleansing \nand expiating. With reason too he follows the origin of adoption; because \nby adoption we become children of God: whereas by carnal generation the \nSon of God became the Son of Man. Moreover he shows sufficiently that he \ndoes not say that Joseph was the son of Heli as though begotten by him, \nbut because he was adopted by him, since he says that Adam was the son of \nGod, inasmuch as he was created by God.\"\nAgain, the number forty pertains to the time of our present life: \nbecause of the four parts of the world in which we pass this mortal life \nunder the rule of Christ. And forty is the product of four multiplied by \nten: while ten is the sum of the numbers from one to four. The number ten \nmay also refer to the decalogue; and the number four to the present life; \nor again to the four Gospels, according to which Christ reigns in us. And \nthus \"Matthew, putting forward the royal personality of Christ, \nenumerates forty persons not counting Him\" (cf. Augustine, De Consensu \nEvang. ii). But this is to be taken on the supposition that it be the \nsame Jechonias at the end of the second, and at the commencement of the \nthird series of fourteen, as Augustine understands it. According to him \nthis was done in order to signify \"that under Jechonias there was a \ncertain defection to strange nations during the Babylonian captivity; \nwhich also foreshadowed the fact that Christ would pass from the Jews to \nthe Gentiles.\"\nOn the other hand, Jerome (on Mt. 1:12-15) says that there were two \nJoachims---that is, Jechonias, father and son: both of whom are mentioned \nin Christ's genealogy, so as to make clear the distinction of the \ngenerations, which the evangelist divides into three series of fourteen; \nwhich amounts in all to forty-two persons. Which number may also be \napplied to the Holy Church: for it is the product of six, which signifies \nthe labor of the present life, and seven, which signifies the rest of the \nlife to come: for six times seven are forty-two. The number fourteen, \nwhich is the sum of ten and four, can also be given the same \nsignification as that given to the number forty, which is the product of \nthe same numbers by multiplication.\nBut the number used by Luke in Christ's genealogy signifies the \ngenerality of sins. \"For the number ten is shown in the ten precepts of \nthe Law to be the number of righteousness. Now, to sin is to go beyond \nthe restriction of the Law. And eleven is the number beyond ten.\" And \nseven signifies universality: because \"universal time is involved in \nseven days.\" Now seven times eleven are seventy-seven: so that this \nnumber signifies the generality of sins which are taken away by Christ.",

        "ANS": "Although the Son of God could have taken flesh from \nwhatever matter He willed, it was nevertheless most becoming that He \nshould take flesh from a woman. First because in this way the entire \nhuman nature was ennobled. Hence Augustine says (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 11): \n\"It was suitable that man's liberation should be made manifest in both \nsexes. Consequently, since it behooved a man, being of the nobler sex, to \nassume, it was becoming that the liberation of the female sex should be \nmanifested in that man being born of a woman.\"\nSecondly, because thus the truth of the Incarnation is made evident. \nWherefore Ambrose says (De Incarn. vi): \"Thou shalt find in Christ many \nthings both natural, and supernatural. In accordance with nature He was \nwithin the womb,\" viz. of a woman's body: \"but it was above nature that a \nvirgin should conceive and give birth: that thou mightest believe that He \nwas God, who was renewing nature; and that He was man who, according to \nnature, was being born of a man.\" And Augustine says (Ep. ad Volus. \ncxxxvii): \"If Almighty God had created a man formed otherwise than in a \nmother's womb, and had suddenly produced him to sight . . . would He not \nhave strengthened an erroneous opinion, and made it impossible for us to \nbelieve that He had become a true man? And whilst He is doing all things \nwondrously, would He have taken away that which He accomplished in mercy? \nBut now, He, the mediator between God and man, has so shown Himself, \nthat, uniting both natures in the unity of one Person, He has given a \ndignity to ordinary by extraordinary things, and tempered the \nextraordinary by the ordinary.\"\nThirdly, because in this fashion the begetting of man is accomplished in \nevery variety of manner. For the first man was made from the \"slime of \nthe earth,\" without the concurrence of man or woman: Eve was made of man \nbut not of woman: and other men are made  from both man and woman. So \nthat this fourth manner remained as it were proper to Christ, that He \nshould be made of a woman without the concurrence of a man.",

But you, Manicheans, being of a mind that admits \nof nought but material images, are utterly unable to grasp these things.\" \nFor, as he again says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii), \"it belongs to the sense \nof man to form conceptions only through tangible bodies, none of which \ncan be entire everywhere, because they must of necessity be diffused \nthrough their innumerable parts in various places . . . Far otherwise is \nthe nature of the soul from that of the body: how much more the nature of \nGod, the Creator of soul and body! . . .

But \nthis was not the case with Christ, as shown above (Question [28], Article [1]).

Wherefore Damascene says (De \nFide Orth. iii) that Christ's body was not conceived \"seminally.\" But the \nmenstrual blood, the flow of which is subject to monthly periods, has a \ncertain natural impurity of corruption: like other superfluities, which \nnature does not heed, and therefore expels. Of such menstrual blood \ninfected with corruption and repudiated by nature, the conception is not \nformed; but from a certain secretion of the pure blood which by a process \nof elimination is prepared for conception, being, as it were, more pure \nand more perfect than the rest of the blood.

For the \nterm of the Incarnation was that that man, who was being conceived, \nshould be the Holy one and the Son of God. Now, both of these are \nattributed to the Holy Ghost. For by Him men are made to be sons of God, \naccording to Gal. 4:6: \"Because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of \nHis Son into your [Vulg.: 'our'] hearts, crying: Abba, Father.\" Again, He \nis the \"Spirit of sanctification,\" according to Rm. 1:4. Therefore, just \nas other men are sanctified spiritually by the Holy Ghost; so as to be \nthe adopted sons of God, so was Christ conceived in sanctity by the Holy \nGhost, so as to be the natural Son of God. Hence, according to a gloss on \nRm. 1:4, the words, \"Who was predestinated the Son of God, in power,\" are \nexplained by what immediately follows: \"According to the Spirit of \nsanctification, i.e. through being conceived of the Holy Ghost.\" And the \nAngel of the Annunciation himself, after saying, \"The Holy Ghost shall \ncome upon thee,\" draws the conclusion: \"Therefore also the Holy which \nshall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"",
        "RP1": "The work of the conception is indeed common to the whole \nTrinity; yet in some way it is attributed to each of the Persons. For to \nthe Father is attributed authority in regard to the Person of the Son, \nwho by this conception took to Himself (human nature). The taking itself \n(of human nature) is attributed to the Son: but the formation of the body \ntaken by the Son is attributed  to the Holy Ghost. For the Holy Ghost is \nthe Spirit of the Son, according to Gal. 4:6: \"God sent the Spirit of His \nSon.\" For just as the power of the soul which is in the semen, through \nthe spirit enclosed therein, fashions the body in the generation of other \nmen, so the Power of God, which is the Son Himself, according to 1 Cor. \n1:24: \"Christ, the Power of God,\" through the Holy Ghost formed the body \nwhich He assumed. This is also shown by the words of the angel: \"The Holy \nGhost shall come upon thee,\" as it were, in order to prepare and fashion \nthe matter of Christ's body; \"and the Power of the Most High,\" i.e. \nChrist, \"shall overshadow thee---that is to say, the incorporeal Light of \nthe Godhead shall in thee take the corporeal substance of human nature: \nfor a shadow is formed by light and body,\" as Gregory says (Moral. \nxviii). The \"Most High\" is the Father, whose Power is the Son.",

And therefore, though mission \nand conception are in the same subject; since they differ in our \nconsideration of them, mission is attributed to the Father, but the \naccomplishment of the conception to the Holy Ghost; whereas the \nassumption of flesh is attributed to the Son.",
        "RP3": "As Augustine says (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 52): \"This \nmay be understood in two ways. For, first, Christ's house is the Church, \nwhich He built with His blood. Secondly, His body may be called His \nhouse, just as it is called His temple . . . and what is done by the Holy \nGhost is done by the Son of God, because Theirs is one Nature and one \nWill.\""

For we do not say that fire generated \nis the son of the fire generating it, except, perhaps, metaphorically; we \nspeak thus only of animals in whom generation is more perfect. \nNevertheless, the word \"son\" is not applied to everything generated in \nanimals, but only to that which is generated into likeness of the \ngenerator. Wherefore, as Augustine says (Enchiridion xxxix), we do not \nsay that a hair which is generated in a man is his son; nor do we say \nthat a man who is born is the son of the seed; for neither is the hair \nlike the man nor is the man born like the seed, but like the man who \nbegot him. And if the likeness be perfect, the sonship is perfect, \nwhether in God or in man. But if the likeness be imperfect, the sonship \nis imperfect. Thus in man there is a certain imperfect likeness to God, \nboth as regards his being created to God's image and as regards His being \ncreated unto the likeness of grace. Therefore in both ways man can be \ncalled His son, both because he is created to His image and because he is \nlikened to Him by grace. Now, it must be observed that what is said in \nits perfect sense of a thing should not be said thereof in its imperfect \nsense: thus, because Socrates is said to be naturally a man, in the \nproper sense of \"man,\" never is he called man in the sense in which the \nportrait of  a man is called a man, although, perhaps, he may resemble \nanother man. Now, Christ is the Son of God in the perfect sense of \nsonship. Wherefore, although in His human nature He was created and \njustified, He ought not to be called the Son of God, either in respect of \nHis being created or of His being justified, but only in respect of His \neternal generation, by reason of which He is the Son of the Father alone. \nTherefore nowise should Christ be called the Son of the Holy Ghost, nor \neven of the whole Trinity.",

By \nnatural power, because they hold that in all natural matter there is an \nactive principle. otherwise they believe that there would be no such \nthing as natural transformation. But in this they are deceived. Because a \ntransformation is said to be natural by reason not only of an active but \nalso of a passive intrinsic principle: for the Philosopher says expressly \n(Phys. viii) that in heavy and light things there is a passive, and not \nan active, principle of natural movement. Nor is it possible for matter \nto be active in its own formation, since it is not in act. Nor, again, is \nit possible for anything to put itself in motion except it be divided \ninto two parts, one being the mover, the other being moved: which happens \nin animate things only, as is proved Phys. viii.\nBy a supernatural power, because they say that the mother requires not \nonly to supply the matter, which is the menstrual blood, but also the \nsemen, which, being mingled with that of the male, has an active power in \ngeneration. And since in the Blessed Virgin there was no resolution of \nsemen, by reason of her inviolate virginity, they say that the Holy Ghost \nsupernaturally bestowed on her an active power in the conception of \nChrist's body, which power other mothers have by reason of the semen \nresolved. But this cannot stand, because, since \"each thing is on account \nof its operation\" (De Coel. ii), nature would not, for the purpose of the \nact of generation, distinguish the male and female sexes, unless the \naction of the male were distinct from that of the female. Now, in \ngeneration there are two distinct operations---that of the agent and that \nof the patient. Wherefore it follows that the entire active operation is \non the part of the male, and the passive on the part of the female. For \nthis reason in plants, where both forces are mingled, there is no \ndistinction of male and female.\nSince, therefore, the Blessed Virgin was not Christ's Father, but His \nMother, it follows that it was not given to her to exercise an active \npower in His conception: whether to cooperate actively so as to be His \nFather, or not to cooperate at all, as some say. whence it would follow \nthat this active power was bestowed on her to no purpose. We must \ntherefore say that in Christ's conception itself she did not cooperate \nactively, but merely supplied the matter thereof.

While, if the conception had been going on for any time \nbefore the perfect formation of the body, the whole conception could not \nbe attributed to the Son of God, since it is not attributed to Him except \nby reason of the assumption of that body.

Therefore \nwhatever belongs to the Divine and to the human nature can be attributed \nto that Person: both when a word is employed to stand for it, signifying \nthe Divine Nature, and when a word is used signifying the human nature. \nNow, conception and birth are attributed to the person and hypostasis in \nrespect of that nature in which it is conceived and born. Since, \ntherefore, the human nature was taken by the Divine Person in the very \nbeginning of the conception, as stated above (Question [33], Article [3]), it follows \nthat it can be truly said that God was conceived and born of the Virgin. \nNow from this is a woman called a man's mother, that she conceived him \nand gave birth to him.

For the only way in which it could be denied that the \nBlessed Virgin is the Mother of God would be either  if the humanity were \nfirst subject to conception and birth, before this man were the Son of \nGod, as Photinus said; or if the humanity were not assumed unto unity of \nthe Person or hypostasis of the Word of God, as Nestorius maintained.

Something like \nthis may be perceived in the generation of Christ.

        "OB2": "Further, filiation, which is said of a man as being the son of \nsomeone, his father or his mother, depends, in a way, on him: because the \nvery being of a relation consists \"in being referred to another\"; \nwherefore if one of two relatives be  destroyed, the other is destroyed \nalso. But the eternal filiation by which Christ is the Son of God the \nFather depends not on His Mother, because nothing eternal depends on what \nis temporal. Therefore Christ is not His Mother's Son by temporal \nfiliation. Either, therefore, He is not her Son at all, which is in \ncontradiction to what has been said above (Articles [3],4), or He must needs be \nher Son by some other temporal filiation. Therefore in Christ there are \ntwo filiations.",

Therefore it seems \nimpossible that one and the same relation be referred to extremes which \nare altogether diverse. But Christ is said to be the Son of the Eternal \nFather and a temporal mother, who are terms altogether diverse. Therefore \nit seems that Christ cannot, by the same relation, be called the Son of \nthe Father and of His Mother Therefore in Christ there are two filiations.",
        "CON": "As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii), things \npertaining to the nature are multiple in Christ; but not those things \nthat pertain to the Person. But filiation belongs especially to the \nPerson, since it is a personal property, as appears from what was said in \nthe FP, Question [32], Article [3]; FP, Question [40], Article [2]. Therefore there is but one \nfiliation in Christ.\nopinions differ on this question. For some, considering \nonly the cause of filiation, which is nativity, put two filiations in \nChrist, just as there are two nativities.  others, \nconsidering only the subject of filiation, which is the person or \nhypostasis, put only one filiation in Christ, just as there is but one \nhypostasis or person. Because the unity or plurality of a relation is \nconsidered in respect, not of its terms, but of its cause or of its \nsubject. For if it were considered in respect of its terms, every man \nwould of necessity have in himself two filiations---one in reference to \nhis father, and another in reference to his mother. But if we consider \nthe question aright, we shall see that every man bears but one relation \nto both his father and his mother, on account of the unity of the cause \nthereof. For man is born by one birth of both father and mother: whence \nhe bears but one relation to both. The same is said of one master who \nteaches many disciples the same doctrine, and of one lord who governs \nmany subjects by the same power. But if there be various causes \nspecifically diverse, it seems that in consequence the relations differ \nin species: wherefore nothing hinders several such relations being in the \nsame subject. Thus if a man teach grammar to some and logic to others, \nhis teaching is of a different kind in one case and in the other; and \ntherefore one and the same man may have different relations as the master \nof different disciples, or of the same disciples in regard to diverse \ndoctrines. Sometimes, however, it happens that a man bears a relation to \nseveral in respect of various causes, but of the same species: thus a \nfather may have several sons by several acts of generation. Wherefore the\npaternity cannot differ specifically, since the acts of generation are \nspecifically the same. And because several forms of the same species \ncannot at the same time be in the same subject, it is impossible for \nseveral paternities to be in a man who is the father of several sons by \nnatural generation. But it would not be so were he the father of one son \nby natural generation and of another by adoption.\nNow, it is manifest that Christ was not born by one and the same \nnativity, of the Father from eternity, and of His Mother in time: indeed, \nthese two nativities differ specifically. Wherefore, as to this, we must \nsay that there are various filiations, one temporal and the other \neternal. Since, however, the subject of filiation is neither the nature \nnor part of the nature, but the person or hypostasis alone; and since in \nChrist there is no other hypostasis or person than the eternal, there can \nbe no other filiation in Christ but that which is in the eternal \nhypostasis. Now, every relation which is predicated of God from time does \nnot put something real in the eternal God, but only something according \nto our way of thinking, as we have said in the FP, Question [13], Article [7]. Therefore \nthe filiation by which Christ is referred to His Mother cannot be a real \nrelation, but only a relation of reason.\nConsequently each opinion is true to a certain extent. For if we \nconsider the adequate causes of filiation, we must needs say that there \nare two filiations in respect of the twofold nativity. But if we consider \nthe subject of filiation, which can only be the eternal suppositum, then \nno other than the eternal filiation in Christ is a real relation. \nNevertheless, He has the relation of Son in regard to His Mother, because \nit is implied in the relation of motherhood to Christ. Thus God is called \nLord by a relation which is implied in the real relation by which the \ncreature is subject to God. And although lordship is not a real relation \nin God, yet is He really Lord through the real subjection of the creature \nto Him. In the same way Christ is really the Son of the Virgin Mother \nthrough the real relation of her motherhood to Christ.",
        "RP1": "Temporal nativity would cause a real temporal filiation in \nChrist if there were in Him a subject capable of such filiation. But this \ncannot be; since the eternal suppositum cannot be receptive of a temporal \nrelation, as stated above. Nor can it be said that it is receptive of \ntemporal filiation by reason of the human nature, just as it is receptive \nof the temporal nativity; because human nature would need in some way to \nbe the subject of filiation, just as in a way it is the subject of \nnativity; for since an Ethiopian is said to be white by reason of his \nteeth, it must be that his teeth are the subject of whiteness. But human \nnature can nowise be the subject of filiation, because this relation \nregards directly the person.",
        "RP2": "Eternal filiation does not depend on a temporal mother, but \ntogether with this eternal filiation we understand a certain temporal \nrelation dependent on the mother, in respect of which relation Christ is \ncalled the Son of His Mother.",
        "RP3": "One and being are mutually consequent, as is said Metaph. \niv. Therefore, just as it happens that in one of the extremes of a \nrelation there is something real, whereas in the other there is not \nsomething real, but merely a certain aspect, as the Philosopher observes \nof knowledge and the thing known; so also it happens that on the part of \none extreme there is one relation, whereas on the part of the other there \nare many. Thus in man on the part of his parents there is a twofold \nrelation, the one of paternity, the other of motherhood, which are \nspecifically diverse, inasmuch as the father is the principle of \ngeneration in one way, and the mother in another (whereas if many be the \nprinciple of one action and in the same way---for instance, if many. \ntogether draw a ship along---there would be one and the same relation in \nall of them); but on the part of the child there is but one filiation in \nreality, though there be two in aspect, corresponding to the two \nrelations in the parents, as considered by the intellect. And thus in one \nway there is only one real filiation in Christ, which is in respect of \nthe Eternal Father: yet there is another temporal relation in regard to \nHis temporal mother."

Each feared a successor to his kingdom: the devil, a heavenly \nsuccessor; Herod, an earthly successor.\" But their fear was needless: \nsince Christ had not come to set up an earthly kingdom, as Pope Leo says, \naddressing himself to Herod: \"Thy palace cannot hold Christ: nor is the \nLord of the world content with the paltry power of thy scepter.\" That the \nJews were troubled, who, on the contrary, should have rejoiced, was \neither because, as Chrysostom says, \"wicked men could not rejoice at the \ncoming of the Holy one,\" or because they wished to court favor with \nHerod, whom they feared; for \"the populace is inclined to favor too much \nthose whose cruelty it endures.\"\nAnd that the children were slain by Herod was not harmful to them, but \nprofitable. For Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (66 de \nDiversis): \"It cannot be questioned that Christ, who came to set man \nfree, rewarded those who were slain for Him; since, while hanging on the \ncross, He prayed for those who were putting Him to death.\""

The Jews, \nhowever, were accustomed to receive Divine answers through the angels; \nthrough whom they also received the Law, according to Acts 7:53: \"You \n[Vulg.: 'who'] . . . have received the Law by the disposition of angels.\" \nAnd the Gentiles, especially astrologers, were wont to observe the course \nof the stars.

For this reason it is compared to the \nmultitude of stars; that a heavenly progeny might be hoped for.\" \nWherefore the Gentiles, \"who are thus designated by the stars, are by the \nrising of a new star stimulated\" to seek Christ, through whom they are \nmade the seed of Abraham.",

Wherefore Herod, immediately after the departure of the \nMagi, \"perceiving that He was deluded by them,\" commanded the male \nchildren to be killed \"from two years old and under,\" being doubtful lest \nChrist were already born when the star appeared, according as he had \nheard from the Magi.\nBut others say that the star first appeared when Christ was born, and \nthat the Magi set off as soon as they saw the star, and accomplished a \njourney of very great length in thirteen days, owing partly to the Divine \nassistance, and partly to the fleetness of the dromedaries. And I say \nthis on the supposition that they came from the far east. But others, \nagain, say that they came from a neighboring country, whence also was \nBalaam, to whose teaching they were heirs; and they are said to have come \nfrom the east, because their country was to the east of the country of \nthe Jews. In this case Herod killed the babes, not as soon as the Magi \ndeparted, but two years after: and that either because he is said to have \ngone to Rome in the meanwhile on account of an accusation brought against \nhim, or because he was troubled at some imminent peril, and for the time \nbeing desisted from his anxiety to slay the child, or because he may have \nthought that the Magi, \"being deceived by the illusory appearance of the \nstar, and not finding the child, as they had expected to, were ashamed to \nreturn to him\": as Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. ii). And the reason \nwhy he killed not only those who were two years old, but also the younger \nchildren, would be, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Innocents, \nbecause he feared lest a child whom the stars obey, might make himself \nappear older or younger."

First, because no other star approaches from the \nsame quarter as this star, whose course was from north to south, these \nbeing the relative positions of Persia, whence the Magi came, and Judea. \nSecondly, from the time [at which it was seen]. For it appeared not only \nat night, but also at midday: and no star can do this, not even the moon. \nThirdly, because it was visible at one time and hidden at another. For \nwhen they entered Jerusalem it hid itself: then, when they had left \nHerod, it showed itself again. Fourthly, because its movement was not \ncontinuous, but when the Magi had to continue their journey the star \nmoved on; when they had to stop the star stood still; as happened to the \npillar of a cloud in the desert. Fifthly, because it indicated the \nvirginal Birth, not by remaining aloft, but by coming down below. For it \nis written (Mt. 2:9) that \"the star which they had seen in the east went \nbefore them, until it came and stood over where the child was.\" Whence it \nis evident that the words of the Magi, \"We have seen His star in the \neast,\" are to be taken as meaning, not that when they were in the east \nthe star appeared over the country of Judea, but that when they saw the \nstar it was in the east, and that it preceded them into Judea (although \nthis is considered doubtful by some). But it could not have indicated the \nhouse distinctly, unless it were near the earth. And, as he [Chrysostom] \nobserves, this does not seem fitting to a star, but  \"of some power \nendowed with reason.\" Consequently \"it seems that this was some invisible \nforce made visible under the form of a star.\"\nWherefore some say that, as the Holy Ghost, after our Lord's Baptism, \ncame down on Him under the form of a dove, so did He appear to the Magi \nunder the form of a star. While others say that the angel who, under a \nhuman form, appeared to the shepherds, under the form of a star, appeared \nto the Magi. But it seems more probable that it was a newly created star, \nnot in the heavens, but in the air near the earth, and that its movement \nvaried according to God's will. Wherefore Pope Leo says in a sermon on \nthe Epiphany (xxxi): \"A star of unusual brightness appeared to the three \nMagi in the east, which, through being more brilliant and more beautiful \nthan the other stars, drew men's gaze and attention: so that they \nunderstood at once that such an unwonted event could not be devoid of \npurpose.\"",

Nevertheless, these birds have a figurative sense. For the \nturtle dove, being a loquacious bird, represents the preaching and \nconfession of faith; and because it is a chaste animal, it signifies \nchastity; and being a solitary animal, it signifies contemplation. The \npigeon is a gentle and simple animal, and therefore signifies gentleness \nand simplicity. It is also a gregarious animal; wherefore it signifies \nthe active life. Consequently this sacrifice signified the perfection of \nChrist and His members. Again, \"both these animals, by the plaintiveness \nof their song, represented the mourning of the saints in this life: but \nthe turtle dove, being solitary, signifies the tears of prayer; whereas \nthe pigeon, being gregarious, signifies the public prayers of the Church\" \n[*Bede, Hom. xv in Purif.].

Some, \nindeed, refer this to the corporeal vision, and say that such a brilliant \nlight shone round about Christ when He was baptized, that the heavens \nseemed to be opened.

Wherefore, as \nChrysostom says, (Hom. xii in Matth.), \"at the Deluge this creature \nappeared bearing an olive branch, and publishing the tidings of the \nuniversal peace of the whole world: and now again the dove appears at the \nbaptism, pointing to our Deliverer.\"\nFourthly, the Holy Ghost appeared over our Lord at His baptism in the \nform of a dove, in order to designate the common effect of \nbaptism---namely, the building up of the unity of the Church. Hence it is \nwritten (Eph. 5:25-27): \"Christ delivered Himself up . . . that He might \npresent . . . to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, \nor any such thing . . . cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of \nlife.\" Therefore it was fitting that the Holy Ghost should appear at the \nbaptism under the form of a dove, which is a creature both loving and \ngregarious. Wherefore also it is said of the Church (Cant 6:8): \"One is \nmy dove.\"\nBut on the apostles the Holy Ghost descended under the form of fire, for \ntwo reasons. First, to show with what fervor their hearts were to be \nmoved, so as to preach Christ everywhere, though  surrounded by \nopposition. And therefore He appeared as a fiery tongue. Hence Augustine \nsays (Super Joan., Tract. vi): Our Lord \"manifests\" the Holy Ghost \n\"visibly in two ways\"---namely, \"by the dove corning upon the Lord when \nHe was baptized; by fire, coming upon the disciples when they were met \ntogether . . . In the former case simplicity is shown, in the latter \nfervor . . . We learn, then, from the dove, that those who are sanctified \nby the Spirit should be without guile: and from the fire, that their \nsimplicity should not be left to wax cold. Nor let it disturb anyone that \nthe tongues were cloven . . . in the dove recognize unity.\"\nSecondly, because, as Chrysostom says (Gregory, Hom. xxx in Ev.): \"Since \nsins had to be forgiven,\" which is effected in baptism, \"meekness was \nrequired\"; this is shown by the dove: \"but when we have obtained grace we \nmust look forward to be judged\"; and this is signified by the fire."

But it was easy for \nAlmighty God, who  created all creatures out of nothing, to frame the \nbody of a real dove without the help of other doves, just as it was easy \nfor Him to form a true body in Mary's womb without the seed of a man: \nsince the corporeal creature obeys its Lord's command and will, both in \nthe mother's womb in forming a man, and in the world itself in forming a \ndove.\"",

Now it is most fitting that he who associates with \nothers should conform to their manner of living; according to the words \nof the Apostle (1 Cor. 9:22): \"I became all things to all men.\" And \ntherefore it was most fitting that Christ should conform to others in the \nmatter of eating and drinking. Hence Augustine says (Contra Faust. xvi) \nthat \"John is  described as 'neither eating nor drinking,' because he did \nnot take the same food as the Jews.

Evang. ii, qu. 11) explains Mt. \n11:19, \"Wisdom is justified by her children,\" saying that this is because \nthe holy apostles \"understood that the kingdom of God does not consist in \neating and drinking, but in suffering indigence with equanimity,\" for \nthey are neither uplifted by affluence, nor distressed by want. Again (De \nDoctr.

And therefore our Lord \nwished to give men an example of either kind of life.\nAs to John, according to Chrysostom (Hom. xxxvii super Matth.), \"he \nexhibited no more than his life and righteous conduct . . . but Christ \nhad the testimony also of miracles.

On which Bede comments, saying that \"John drank \nneither wine nor strong drink: because abstinence is meritorious where \nthe nature is weak.

And for this did He proceed \nno further than Moses and Elias, lest His assumption of our flesh might \nseem incredible.\" The mystical meaning, as Gregory says (Hom. xvi in \nEvang.), is that by Christ's example the number \"forty\" is observed in \nHis fast, because the power of the \"decalogue is fulfilled throughout the \nfour books of the Holy Gospel: since ten multiplied by four amounts to \nforty.\" Or, because \"we live in this mortal body composed of the four \nelements, and by its lusts we transgress the commandments of the Lord, \nwhich are expressed in the decalogue.\" Or, according to Augustine (Questions. \nlxxxiii, qu. 81): \"To know the Creator and the creature is the entire \nteaching of wisdom. The Creator is the  Trinity, the Father, the Son, and \nthe Holy Ghost. Now the creature is partly invisible, as the soul, to \nwhich the number three may be ascribed, for we are commanded to love God \nin three ways, 'with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole \nmind'; and partly visible, as the body, to which the number four is \napplicable on account of its being subject to heat, moisture, cold, and \ndryness. Hence if we multiply ten, which may be referred to the entire \nmoral code, by four, which number may be applied to the body, because it \nis the body that executes the law, the product is the number forty: in \nwhich,\" consequently, \"the time during which we sigh and grieve is shown \nforth.\" And yet there was no inconsistency in Christ's returning to the \ncommon manner of living, after fasting and (retiring into the) desert. \nFor it is becoming to that kind of life, which we hold Christ to have \nembraced, wherein a man delivers to others the fruits of his \ncontemplation, that he devote himself first of all to contemplation, and \nthat he afterwards come down to the publicity of active life by \nassociating with other men. Hence Bede says on Mk. 2:18: \"Christ fasted, \nthat thou mightest not disobey the commandment; He ate with sinners, that \nthou mightest discern His sanctity and acknowledge His power.\""

First, because this was in keeping with the duty of \npreaching, for which purpose He says that He came (Mk. 1:38): \"Let us go \ninto the neighboring towns and cities, that I may preach there also: for \nto this purpose am I come.\" Now in order that the preachers of God's word \nmay be able to give all their time to preaching, they must be wholly free \nfrom care of worldly matters: which is impossible for those who are \npossessed of wealth.

He became poor for our [Vulg.: \n'your'] sakes that through His poverty we [Vulg.: 'you'] might be rich.\"\nThirdly, lest if He were rich His preaching might be ascribed to \ncupidity. Wherefore Jerome says on Mt. 10:9, that if the disciples had \nbeen possessed of wealth, \"they had seemed to preach for gain, not for \nthe salvation of mankind.\" And the same reason applies to Christ.\nFourthly, that the more lowly He seemed by reason of His poverty, the \ngreater might the power of His Godhead be shown to be. Hence in a sermon \nof the Council of Ephesus (P. iii, c. ix) we read: \"He chose all that was \npoor and despicable, all that was of small account and hidden from the \nmajority, that we might recognize His Godhead to have transformed the \nterrestrial sphere.

But forasmuch as \nChrist was incapable of sin, He had not the same motive as Solomon for \navoiding these things. Yet neither is every kind of beggary an occasion \nof theft and perjury, as Solomon seems to add (Prov. 30:8); but only that \nwhich is involuntary, in order to avoid which, a man is guilty of theft \nand perjury.

        "RP1": "Our Lord excuses Himself from any transgression of the Law \nin this matter, for three reasons. First, the precept of the hallowing of \nthe Sabbath forbids not Divine work, but human work: for though God \nceased on the seventh day from the creation of new creatures, yet He ever \nworks by keeping and governing His creatures. Now that Christ wrought \nmiracles was a Divine work: hence He says (Jn. 5:17): \"My Father worketh \nuntil now; and I work.\"\nSecondly, He excuses Himself on the ground that this precept does not \nforbid works which are needful for bodily health. Wherefore He says (Lk. 13:15): \"Doth not every one of you on the Sabbath-day loose his ox or his \nass from the manger, and lead them to water?\" And farther on (Lk. 14:5): \n\"Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not \nimmediately draw him out on the Sabbath-day?\" Now it is manifest that the \nmiraculous works done by Christ related to health of body and soul.\nThirdly, because this precept does not forbid works pertaining to the \nworship of God. Wherefore He says (Mt. 12:5): \"Have ye not read in the \nLaw that on the Sabbath-days the priests in the Temple break the Sabbath, \nand are without blame?\" And (Jn. 7:23) it is written that a man receives \ncircumcision on the Sabbath-day. Now when Christ commanded the paralytic \nto carry his bed on the Sabbath-day, this pertained to the worship of \nGod, i.e. to the praise of God's power. And thus it is clear that He did \nnot break the Sabbath: although the Jews threw this false accusation in \nHis face, saying (Jn. 9:16): \"This man is not of God, who keepeth not the \nSabbath.\"",

Hence Gregory says in a homily (xvi in \nEvang.): \"It was not unworthy of our Redeemer to wish to be tempted, who \ncame also to be slain; in order that by His temptations He might conquer \nour temptations, just as by His death He overcame our death.\"\nSecondly, that we might be warned, so that none, however holy, may think \nhimself safe or free from temptation. Wherefore also He wished to be \ntempted after His baptism, because, as Hilary says (Super Matth., cap. \niii.): \"The temptations of the devil assail those principally who are \nsanctified, for he desires, above all, to overcome the holy. Hence also \nit is written (Ecclus. 2): Son, when thou comest to the service of God, \nstand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.\"\nThirdly, in order to give us an example: to teach us, to wit, how to \novercome the temptations of the devil. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. iv) \nthat Christ \"allowed Himself to be tempted\" by the devil, \"that He might \nbe our Mediator in overcoming temptations,  not only by helping us, but \nalso by giving us an example.\"\nFourthly, in order to fill us with confidence in His mercy.

But since they also \nobserved in Him certain signs of human frailty, they did not know for \ncertain that He was the Son of God: wherefore (the devil) wished to tempt \nHim. This is implied by the words of Mt. 4:2,3, saying that, after \"He \nwas hungry, the tempter\" came \"to Him,\" because, as Hilary says (Super \nMatth., cap. iii), \"Had not Christ's weakness in hungering betrayed His \nhuman nature, the devil would not have dared to tempt Him.\" Moreover, \nthis appears from the very manner of the temptation, when he said: \"If \nThou be the Son of God.\" Which words Ambrose explains as follows (In Luc. \niv): \"What means this way of addressing Him, save that, though he knew \nthat the Son of God was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in \nthe weakness of the flesh?\"",

For that He allowed Himself to be tempted was \ndue to His own will. Wherefore it is written (Mt. 4:1): \"Jesus was led by \nthe Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil\"; and Gregory \n(Hom. xvi in Evang.) says this is to be understood of the Holy Ghost, to \nwit, that \"thither did His Spirit lead Him, where the wicked spirit would \nfind Him and tempt Him.\" But He suffered from the devil in being \"taken \nup\" on to \"the pinnacle of the Temple\" and again \"into a very high \nmountain.\" Nor is it strange, as Gregory observes, \"that He allowed \nHimself to be taken by him on to a mountain, who allowed Himself to be \ncrucified by His members.\" And we understand Him to have been taken up by \nthe devil, not, as it were, by force, but because, as Origen says (Hom. \nxxi super Luc.), \"He followed Him in the course of His temptation like a \nwrestler advancing of his own accord.\"",
        "RP3": "As the Apostle says (Heb. 4:15), Christ wished to be \n\"tempted in all things, without sin.\" Now temptation which comes from an \nenemy can be without sin: because it comes about by merely outward \nsuggestion. But temptation which comes from the flesh cannot be without \nsin, because such a temptation is caused by pleasure and concupiscence; \nand, as Augustine says (De Civ.

And such occasions of temptation are not to be avoided. Hence \nChrysostom says (Hom. v in Matth.

For it is not enough for \nthem to sit idle; the Holy Ghost urges them to endeavor to do something \ngreat: which is for them to be in the desert from the devil's standpoint, \nfor no unrighteousness, in which the devil delights, is there. Again, \nevery good work, compared to the flesh and the world, is the desert; \nbecause it is not according to the will of the flesh and of the world.\" \nNow, there is no danger in giving the devil such an occasion of \ntemptation; since the help of the Holy Ghost, who is the Author of the \nperfect deed, is more powerful* than the assault of the envious devil. \n[*All the codices read 'majus.' One of the earliest printed editions has \n'magis,' which has much to commend it, since St. Thomas is commenting the \ntext quoted from St. Chrysostom.

Hence the \nApostle (2 Cor. 6:5,7) reckons \"fastings\" together with the \"armor of \njustice.\"\nSecondly, in order to show that the devil assails with temptations even \nthose who fast, as likewise those who are given to other good works.

However, it \nmatters not, provided it be made clear that all these things did take \nplace.\" It may be that the Evangelists set these things in different \norders, because sometimes cupidity arises from vainglory, sometimes the \nreverse happens.\nReply to Objection 6: When Christ had suffered the wrong of being tempted by the \ndevil saying, \"If Thou be the Son of God cast Thyself down,\" He was not \ntroubled, nor did He upbraid the devil. But when the devil usurped to \nhimself the honor due to God, saying, \"All these things will I give Thee, \nif, falling down, Thou wilt adore me,\" He was exasperated, and repulsed \nhim, saying, \"Begone, Satan\": that we might learn from His example to \nbear bravely insults leveled at ourselves, but not to allow ourselves so \nmuch as to listen to those which are aimed at God.\nReply to Objection 7: As Chrysostom says (Hom. v in Matth.): \"The devil set Him\" \n(on a pinnacle of the Temple) \"that He might be seen by all, whereas, \nunawares to the devil, He acted in such sort that He was seen by none.\"\nIn regard to the words, \"'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, \nand the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very \nkingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but \nthat the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city \nlay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate.\" Or, again, as \nOrigen says (Hom. xxx in Luc.), \"he showed Him how, by means of the \nvarious vices, he was the lord of the world.\"",
        "ANS": "The temptation which comes from the enemy takes the form \nof a suggestion, as Gregory says (Hom. xvi in Evang.). Now a suggestion \ncannot be made to everybody in the same way; it must arise from those \nthings towards which each one has an inclination. Consequently the devil \ndoes not straight away tempt the spiritual man to grave sins, but he \nbegins with lighter sins, so as gradually to lead him to those of greater \nmagnitude. Wherefore Gregory (Moral. xxxi), expounding Job 39:25, \"He \nsmelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains and the \nshouting of the army,\" says: \"The captains are fittingly described as \nencouraging, and the army as shouting. Because vices begin by insinuating \nthemselves into the mind under some specious pretext: then they come on \nthe mind in such numbers as to drag it into all sorts of folly, deafening \nit with their bestial clamor.\"\nThus, too, did the devil set about the temptation of the first man. For \nat first he enticed his mind to consent to the eating of the forbidden \nfruit, saying (Gn. 3:1): \"Why hath God commanded you that you should not \neat of every tree of paradise?\" Secondly [he tempted him] to vainglory by \nsaying: \"Your eyes shall be opened.\" Thirdly, he led the temptation to \nthe extreme height of pride, saying: \"You shall be as gods, knowing good \nand evil.\" This same order did he observe in tempting Christ. For at \nfirst he tempted Him to that which men desire, however spiritual they may \nbe---namely, the support of the corporeal nature by food. Secondly, he \nadvanced to that matter in which spiritual men are sometimes found \nwanting, inasmuch as they do certain things for show, which pertains to \nvainglory. Thirdly, he led the temptation on to that in which no \nspiritual men, but only carnal men, have a part---namely, to desire \nworldly riches and fame, to the extent of holding God in contempt. And so \nin the first two temptations he said: \"If Thou be the Son of God\"; but \nnot in the third, which is inapplicable to  spiritual men, who are sons \nof God by adoption, whereas it does apply to the two preceding \ntemptations.\nAnd Christ resisted these temptations by quoting the authority of the \nLaw, not by enforcing His power, \"so as to give more honor to His human \nnature and a greater punishment to His adversary, since the foe of the \nhuman race was vanquished, not as by God, but as by man\"; as Pope Leo \nsays (Serm. 1, De Quadrag. 3).",
        "RP1": "To make use of what is needful for self-support is not the \nsin of gluttony; but if a man do anything inordinate out of the desire \nfor such support, it can pertain to the sin of gluttony. Now it is \ninordinate for a man who has human assistance at his command to seek to \nobtain food miraculously for mere bodily support. Hence the Lord \nmiraculously provided the children of Israel with manna in the desert, \nwhere there was no means of obtaining food otherwise. And in like fashion \nChrist miraculously provided the crowds with food in the desert, when \nthere was no other means of getting food. But in order to assuage His \nhunger, He could have done otherwise than work a miracle, as did John the \nBaptist, according to Matthew (3:4); or He could have hastened to the \nneighboring country. Consequently the devil esteemed that if Christ was a \nmere man, He would fall into sin by attempting to assuage His hunger by a \nmiracle.",
        "RP2": "It often happens that a man seeks to derive glory from \nexternal humiliation, whereby he is exalted by reason of spiritual good. \nHence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12): \"It must be noted \nthat it is possible to boast not only of the beauty and splendor of \nmaterial things, but even of filthy squalor.\" And this is signified by \nthe devil urging Christ to seek spiritual glory by casting His body down.",
        "RP3": "It is a sin to desire worldly riches and honors in an \ninordinate fashion. And the principal sign of this is when a man does \nsomething wrong in order to acquire such things. And so the devil was not \nsatisfied with instigating to a desire for riches and honors, but he went \nso far as to tempt Christ, for the sake of gaining possession of these \nthings, to fall down and adore him, which is a very great crime, and \nagainst God. Nor does he say merely, \"if Thou wilt adore me,\" but he \nadds, \"if, falling down\"; because, as Ambrose says on Lk. 4:5: \"Ambition \nharbors yet another danger within itself: for, while seeking to rule, it \nwill serve; it will bow in submission that it may be crowned with honor; \nand the higher it aims, the lower it abases itself.\"\nIn like manner [the devil] in the preceding temptations tried to lead \n[Christ] from the desire of one sin to the commission of another; thus \nfrom the desire of food he tried to lead Him to the vanity of the \nneedless working of a miracle; and from the desire of glory to tempt God \nby casting Himself headlong.",

Therefore it \nseems that it was \"a small thing\" that He preached to Jews alone, and not \nto the Gentiles.",
        "OB2": "Further, as it is written (Mt. 7:29): \"He was teaching them as \none having power.\" Now the power of doctrine is made more manifest in the \ninstruction of those who, like the Gentiles, have received no tidings \nwhatever; hence the Apostle says (Rm. 15:20): \"I have so preached the \n[Vulg.: 'this'] gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build \nupon another man's foundation.\" Therefore much rather should Christ have \npreached to the Gentiles than to the Jews.",

        "ANS": "It was fitting that Christ's preaching, whether through \nHimself or through His apostles, should be directed at first to the Jews \nalone. First, in order to show that by His coming the promises were \nfulfilled which had been made to the Jews of old, and not to the \nGentiles. Thus the Apostle says (Rm. 15:8): \"I say that Christ . . . was \nminister of the circumcision,\" i.e. the apostle and preacher of the Jews, \n\"for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.\"\nSecondly, in order to show that His coming was of God; because, as is \nwritten Rm. 13:1: \"Those things which are of God are well ordered [Vulg.: \n'those that are, are ordained of God']\" [*See Scriptural Index on this \npassage]. Now the right order demanded that the doctrine of Christ should \nbe made known first to the Jews, who, by believing in and worshiping one \nGod, were nearer to God, and that it should be transmitted through them \nto the Gentiles: just as in the heavenly hierarchy the Divine \nenlightenment comes to the lower angels through the higher. Hence on Mt. \n15:24, \"I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost in the house of \nIsrael,\" Jerome  says: \"He does not mean by this that He was not sent to \nthe Gentiles, but that He was sent to the Jews first.\" And so we read \n(Is. 66:19): \"I will send of them that shall be saved,\" i.e. of the Jews, \n\"to the Gentiles . . . and they shall declare My glory unto the Gentiles.\"\nThirdly, in order to deprive the Jews of ground for quibbling. Hence on \nMt. 10:5, \"Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles.\" Jerome says: \"It \nbehooved Christ's coming to be announced to the Jews first, lest they \nshould have a valid excuse, and say that they had rejected our Lord \nbecause He had sent His apostles to the Gentiles and Samaritans.\"\nFourthly, because it was through the triumph of the cross that Christ \nmerited power and lordship over the Gentiles. Hence it is written (Apoc. 2:26,28): \"He that shall overcome . . . I will give him power over the \nnations . . . as I also have received of My Father\"; and that because He \nbecame \"obedient unto the death of the cross, God hath exalted Him . . . \nthat in the name of Jesus every knee should bow . . .\" and that \"every \ntongue should confess Him\" (Phil. 2:8-11). Consequently He did not wish \nHis doctrine to be preached to the Gentiles before His Passion: it was \nafter His Passion that He said to His disciples (Mt. 28:19): \"Going, \nteach ye all nations.\" For this reason it was that when, shortly before \nHis Passion, certain Gentiles wished to see Jesus, He said: \"Unless the \ngrain of wheat falling into the ground dieth, itself remaineth alone: but \nif it die it bringeth forth much fruit\" (Jn. 12:20-25); and as Augustine \nsays, commenting on this passage: \"He called Himself the grain of wheat \nthat must be mortified by the unbelief of the Jews, multiplied by the \nfaith of the nations.\"",

And thus the Divine \npower of Christ was specially shown in this, that He bestowed on the \nteaching of His disciples such a power that they converted the Gentiles \nto Christ, although these had heard nothing of Him.\nNow the power of Christ's teaching is to be considered in the miracles \nby which He confirmed His doctrine, in the efficacy of His persuasion, \nand in the authority of His words, for He spoke as being Himself above \nthe Law when He said: \"But I say to you\" (Mt. 5:22,28,32,34,39,44); and, \nagain, in the force of His righteousness shown in His sinless manner of \nlife.",

And this may happen in two \nways---sometimes through envy on the part of the teacher, who desires to \nexcel in his knowledge, wherefore he is unwilling to communicate it to \nothers. But this was not the case  with Christ, in whose person the \nfollowing words are spoken (Wis. 7:13): \"Which I have learned without \nguile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.\" But \nsometimes this happens through the vileness of the things taught; thus \nAugustine says on Jn. 16:12: \"There are some things so bad that no sort \nof human modesty can bear them.\" Wherefore of heretical doctrine it is \nwritten (Prov. 9:17): \"Stolen waters are sweeter.\" Now, Christ's doctrine \nis \"not of error nor of uncleanness\" (1 Thess. 2:3).

Nevertheless our \nLord expounded the open and unveiled truth of these parables to His \ndisciples, so that they might hand it down to others worthy of it; \naccording to 2 Tim. 2:2: \"The things which thou hast heard of me by many \nwitnesses, the same command to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach \nothers.\" This is foreshadowed, Num. 4, where the sons of Aaron are \ncommanded to wrap up the sacred vessels that were to be carried by the \nLevites.",

His \nmeaning, therefore, is that whatever He said we also should say in the \nmidst of unbelievers, by openly believing and professing it.\"\nOr, according to Jerome, He speaks comparatively---that is to say, \nbecause He was instructing them in Judea, which was a small place \ncompared with the whole world, where Christ's doctrine was to be \npublished by the preaching of the apostles.",

        "ANS": "The miracles which Christ worked were a sufficient proof \nof His Godhead in three respects. First, as to the  very nature of the \nworks, which surpassed the entire capability of created power, and \ntherefore could not be done save by Divine power. For this reason the \nblind man, after his sight had been restored, said (Jn. 9:32,33): \"From \nthe beginning of the world it has not been heard, that any man hath \nopened the eyes of one born blind. Unless this man were of God, he could \nnot do anything.\"\nSecondly, as to the way in which He worked miracles---namely, because He \nworked miracles as though of His own power, and not by praying, as others \ndo. Wherefore it is written (Lk. 6:19) that \"virtue went out from Him and \nhealed all.\" Whereby it is proved, as Cyril says (Comment. in Lucam) that \n\"He did not receive power from another, but, being God by nature, He \nshowed His own power over the sick. And this is how He worked countless \nmiracles.\" Hence on Mt. 8:16: \"He cast out spirits with His word, and all \nthat were sick He healed,\" Chrysostom says: \"Mark how great a multitude \nof persons healed, the Evangelists pass quickly over, not mentioning one \nby one . . . but in one word traversing an unspeakable sea of miracles.\" \nAnd thus it was shown that His power was co-equal with that of God the \nFather, according to Jn. 5:19: \"What things soever\" the Father \"doth, \nthese the Son doth also in like manner\"; and, again (Jn. 5:21): \"As the \nFather raiseth up the dead and giveth life, so the Son also giveth life \nto whom He will.\"\nThirdly, from the very fact that He taught that He was God; for unless \nthis were true it would not be confirmed by miracles worked by Divine \npower. Hence it was said (Mk. 1:27): \"What is this new doctrine? For with \npower He commandeth the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.\"",
        "RP1": "This was the argument of the Gentiles. Wherefore Augustine \nsays (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): \"No suitable wonders; say they, show \nforth the presence of so great majesty, for the ghostly cleansing\" \nwhereby He cast out demons, \"the cure of the sick, the raising of the \ndead to life, if other miracles be taken into account, are small things \nbefore God.\" To this Augustine answers thus: \"We own that the prophets \ndid as much . . . But even Moses himself and the other prophets made \nChrist the Lord the object of their prophecy, and gave Him great glory . \n. . He, therefore, chose to do similar things to avoid the inconsistency \nof failing to do what He had done through others. Yet still He was bound \nto do something which no other had done: to be born of a virgin, to rise \nfrom the dead, and to ascend into heaven. If anyone deem this a slight \nthing for God to do, I know not what more he can expect. Having become \nman, ought He to have made another world, that we might believe Him to be \nHim by whom the world was made? But in this world neither a greater world \ncould be made nor one equal to it: and if He had made a lesser world in \ncomparison with this, that too would have been deemed a small thing.\"\nAs to the miracles worked by others, Christ did greater still. Hence on \nJn. 15:24: \"If I had not done in [Douay: 'among'] them the works that no \nother men hath done,\" etc., Augustine says: \"None of the works of Christ \nseem to be greater than the raising of the  dead: which thing we know the \nancient prophets also did . . . Yet Christ did some works 'which no other \nman hath done.' But we are told in answer that others did works which He \ndid not, and which none other did . . . But to heal with so great a power \nso many defects and ailments and grievances of mortal men, this we read \nconcerning none soever of the men of old. To say nothing of those, each \nof whom by His bidding, as they came in His way, He made whole . . . Mark \nsaith (6:56): 'Whithersoever He entered, into towns or into villages or \ninto cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that \nthey might touch but the hem of His garment: and as many as touched Him \nwere made whole.' These things none other did in them; for when He saith \n'In them,' it is not to be understood to mean 'Among them,' or 'In their \npresence,' but wholly 'In them,' because He healed them . . . Therefore \nwhatever works He did in them are works that none ever did; since if ever \nany other man did any one of them, by His doing he did it; whereas these \nworks He did, not by their doing, but by Himself.\"",

'The Father who abideth in Me, \nHe doth the works,' what works did He mean, then, but the words He was \nspeaking? . . . and the fruits of those same words was the faith of those \n(who believed): but when the disciples preached the Gospel, not some few \nlike those, but the very nations believed . . .

Behold, He did \ngreater works when spoken of by men believing than when speaking to men \nhearing. But there is yet this difficulty: that He did these 'greater \nworks' by the apostles: whereas He saith as meaning not only them: . . . \n'He that believeth in Me' . . . Listen! . . . 'He that believeth in Me, \nthe works that I do, he also shall do': first, 'I do,' then 'he also \nshall do,' because I do that he may do.

Certainly if both are works of equal power, the latter is \na work of greater mercy.\"\n\"But there is no need for us to understand all the works of Christ, \nwhere He saith 'Greater than these shall he do.' For by 'these' He meant, \nperhaps, those which He was doing at that hour:  now at that time He was \nspeaking words of faith: . . . and certainly it is less to preach words \nof righteousness, which thing He did without us, than to justify the \nungodly, which thing He so doth in us that we also do it ourselves.\"",

But He was known to them, not as to the holy angels, by that \nwhich is eternal life, but by certain temporal effects of His power.\" \nFirst, when they saw that Christ was hungry after fasting they deemed Him \nnot to be the Son of God. Hence, on Lk. 4:3, \"If Thou be the Son of God,\" \netc., Ambrose says: \"What means this way of addressing Him? save that, \nthough He knew that the Son of God was to come, yet he did not think that \nHe had come in the weakness of the flesh?\" But afterwards, when he saw \nHim work miracles, he had a sort of conjectural suspicion that He was the \nSon of God. Hence on Mk. 1:24, \"I know who Thou art, the Holy one of \nGod,\" Chrysostom [*Victor of Antioch. Cf. Catena Aurea] says that \"he had \nno certain or firm knowledge of God's coming.\" Yet he knew that He was \n\"the Christ promised in the Law,\" wherefore it is said (Lk. 4:41) that \n\"they knew that He was Christ.\" But it was rather from suspicion than \nfrom certainty that they confessed Him to be the Son of God.

For when the devil saw Him \nweakened by His fast, He knew Him to be a real man: but when He failed to \novercome Him by temptation, He doubted lest He should be the Son of God. \nAnd now from the power of His miracles He either knew, or rather \nsuspected that He was the Son of God. His reason therefore for persuading \nthe Jews to crucify Him was not that he deemed Him not to be Christ or  \nthe Son of God, but because he did not foresee that he would be the loser \nby His death. For the Apostle says of this mystery\" (1 Cor. 2:7,8), \n\"which is hidden from the beginning, that 'none of the princes of this \nworld knew it,' for if they had known it they would never have crucified \nthe Lord of glory.\"",

For it is wrong to seek \nto learn from the devil when we have the Divine Scripture\": Besides, it \nis dangerous, since the demons frequently mix falsehood with truth. Or, \nas Chrysostom [*Cyril of Alexandria, Comment. in Luc.] says: \"It was not \nmeet for them to usurp the prerogative of the apostolic office. Nor was \nit fitting that the mystery of Christ should be proclaimed by a corrupt \ntongue\" because \"praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner\" [*Cf. \nTheophylact, Enarr. in Luc.]. Thirdly, because, as Bede says, \"He did not \nwish the envy of the Jews to be aroused thereby\" [*Bede, Expos. in Luc. \niv, 41].

Hence Chrysostom says on Mt. 8:32 \nthat Christ let the demons depart into the swine, \"not as yielding to the \ndemons, but first, to show . . . how harmful are the demons who attack \nmen; secondly, that all might learn that the demons would not dare to \nhurt even the swine, except He allow them; thirdly, that they would have \ntreated those men more grievously than they treated the swine, unless \nthey had been protected by God's providence.\"\nAnd for the same motives He allowed the man, who was being delivered \nfrom the demons, to suffer grievously for the moment; yet did He release \nhim at once from that distress. By this, moreover, we are taught, as Bede \nsays on Mk. 9:25, that \"often, when after falling into sin we strive to \nreturn to God, we experience further and more grievous attacks from the \nold enemy.

        "RP2": "The order of the seasons was not disturbed by the miracle \nworked by Christ. For, according to some, this gloom or darkening of the \nsun, which occurred at the time of Christ's passion, was caused by the \nsun withdrawing its rays, without any change in the movement of the \nheavenly bodies, which measures the duration of the seasons. Hence Jerome \nsays on Mt. 27:45: \"It seems as though the 'greater light' withdrew its \nrays, lest it should look on its Lord hanging on the Cross, or bestow its \nradiancy on the impious blasphemers.\" And this withdrawal of the rays is \nnot to be understood as though it were in the sun's power to send forth \nor withdraw its rays: for it sheds its light, not from choice, but by \nnature, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). But the sun is said to withdraw \nits rays in so far as the Divine power caused the sun's rays not to reach \nthe earth. On the other hand, Origen says this was caused by clouds \ncoming between (the earth and the sun). Hence on Mt. 27:45 he says: \"We \nmust therefore suppose that many large and very dense clouds were massed \ntogether over Jerusalem and the land of Judea; so that it was exceedingly \ndark from the sixth to the ninth hour. Hence I am of opinion that, just \nas the other signs which occurred at the time of the Passion\"---namely, \n\"the rending of the veil, the quaking of the earth,\" etc.---\"took place \nin Jerusalem only, so this also: . . . or if anyone prefer, it may be \nextended to the whole of Judea,\" since it is said that \"'there was \ndarkness over the whole earth,' which expression refers to the land of \nJudea, as may be gathered from 3 Kgs. 18:10, where Abdias says to Elias: \n'As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom whither my \nlord hath not sent to seek thee': which shows that they sought him among \nthe nations in the neighborhood of Judea.\"\nOn this point, however, credence is to be given rather to Dionysius, who \nis an eyewitness as to this having occurred by the moon eclipsing the \nsun. For he says (Ep. ad Polycarp): \"Without any doubt we saw the moon \nencroach on the sun,\" he being in Egypt at the time, as he says in the \nsame letter. And in this he points out four miracles. The first is that \nthe natural eclipse of the sun by interposition of the moon never takes \nplace except when the sun and moon are in conjunction. But then the sun \nand moon were in opposition, it being the fifteenth day, since it was the \nJewish Passover. Wherefore he says: \"For it was not the time of \nconjunction.\"---The second miracle is that whereas at the sixth hour the \nmoon was seen, together with the sun, in the middle of the heavens, in \nthe evening it was seen to be in its place, i.e. in the east, opposite \nthe sun. Wherefore he says: \"Again we saw it,\" i.e. the moon, \"return \nsupernaturally into opposition with the sun,\" so as to be diametrically \nopposite, having withdrawn from the sun \"at the ninth hour,\" when the \ndarkness ceased, \"until evening.\" From this it is clear that the wonted \ncourse of the seasons was not disturbed, because the Divine power caused \nthe moon both to approach the sun supernaturally at an unwonted season, \nand to withdraw from the sun and return to its proper place according to  \nthe season. The third miracle was that the eclipse of the sun naturally \nalways begins in that part of the sun which is to the west and spreads \ntowards the east: and this is because the moon's proper movement from \nwest to east is more rapid than that of the sun, and consequently the \nmoon, coming up from the west, overtakes the sun and passes it on its \neastward course. But in this case the moon had already passed the sun, \nand was distant from it by the length of half the heavenly circle, being \nopposite to it: consequently it had to return eastwards towards the sun, \nso as to come into apparent contact with it from the east, and continue \nin a westerly direction. This is what he refers to when he says: \n\"Moreover, we saw the eclipse begin to the east and spread towards the \nwestern edge of the sun,\" for it was a total eclipse, \"and afterwards \npass away.\" The fourth miracle consisted in this, that in a natural \neclipse that part of the sun which is first eclipsed is the first to \nreappear (because the moon, coming in front of the sun, by its natural \nmovement passes on to the east, so as to come away first from the western \nportion of the sun, which was the first part to be eclipsed), whereas in \nthis case the moon, while returning miraculously from the east to the \nwest, did not pass the sun so as to be to the west of it: but having \nreached the western edge of the sun returned towards the east: so that \nthe last portion of the sun to be eclipsed was the first to reappear. \nConsequently the eclipse began towards the east, whereas the sun began to \nreappear towards the west. And to this he refers by saying: \"Again we \nobserved that the occultation and emersion did not begin from the same \npoint,\" i.e. on the same side of the sun, \"but on opposite sides.\"\nChrysostom adds a fifth miracle (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.), saying that \n\"the darkness in this case lasted for three hours, whereas an eclipse of \nthe sun lasts but a short time, for it is soon over, as those know who \nhave seen one.\" Hence we are given to understand that the moon was \nstationary below the sun, except we prefer to say that the duration of \nthe darkness was measured from the first moment of occultation of the sun \nto the moment when the sun had completely emerged from the eclipse.\nBut, as Origen says (on Mt. 27:45), \"against this the children of this \nworld object: How is it such a phenomenal occurrence is not related by \nany writer, whether Greek or barbarian?\" And he says that someone of the \nname of Phlegon \"relates in his chronicles that this took place during \nthe reign of Tiberius Caesar, but he does not say that it occurred at the \nfull moon.\" It may be, therefore, that because it was not the time for an \neclipse, the various astronomers living then throughout the world were \nnot on the look-out for one, and that they ascribed this darkness to some \ndisturbance of the atmosphere. But in Egypt, where clouds are few on \naccount of the tranquillity of the air, Dionysius and his companions were \nconsiderably astonished so as to make the aforesaid observations about \nthis darkness.",
        "RP3": "Then, above all, was there need for miraculous proof of \nChrist's Godhead, when the weakness of human nature was  most apparent in \nHim. Hence it was that at His birth a new star appeared in the heavens. \nWherefore Maximus says (Serm. de Nativ. viii): \"If thou disdain the \nmanger, raise thine eyes a little and gaze on the new star in the \nheavens, proclaiming to the world the birth of our Lord.\" But in His \nPassion yet greater weakness appeared in His manhood. Therefore there was \nneed for yet greater miracles in the greater lights of the world. And, as \nChrysostom says (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.): \"This is the sign which He \npromised to them who sought for one saying: 'An evil and adulterous \ngeneration seeketh a sign; and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign \nof Jonas the prophet,' referring to His Cross . . . and Resurrection . . \n.

        "question": "Whether Christ worked miracles fittingly on men?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that Christ worked miracles unfittingly on men. For \nin man the soul is of more import than the body. Now Christ worked many \nmiracles on bodies, but we do not read of His working any miracles on \nsouls: for neither did He convert any unbelievers to the faith mightily, \nbut by persuading and convincing them with outward miracles, nor is it \nrelated of Him that He made wise men out of fools. Therefore it seems \nthat He worked miracles on men in an unfitting manner.",
        "OB2": "Further, as stated above (Question [43], Article [2]), Christ worked miracles by \nDivine power: to which it is proper to work suddenly, perfectly, and \nwithout any assistance. Now Christ did not always heal men suddenly as to \ntheir bodies: for it is written (Mk. 8:22-25) that, \"taking the blind man \nby the hand, He led him out of the town; and, spitting upon his eyes, \nlaying His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. And, looking \nup, he said: I see men as it were trees walking. After that again He laid \nHis hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and was restored, so that \nhe saw all things clearly.\" It is clear from this that He did not heal \nhim suddenly, but at first imperfectly, and by means of His spittle. \nTherefore it seems that He worked miracles on men unfittingly.",

Now bodily ailments are not always the \nresult of sin, as appears from our Lord's words (Jn. 9:3): \"Neither hath \nthis man sinned, nor his parents, that he should be born blind.\" It was \nunseemly, therefore, for Him to forgive the sins of those who sought the \nhealing of the body, as He is related to have done in the case of the man \nsick of the palsy (Mt. 9:2): the more that the healing of the body, being \nof less account than the forgiveness of sins, does not seem a sufficient \nargument for the power of forgiving sins.",

Now Christ \ncame into the world and taught in order to save man, according to Jn. \n3:17: \"For God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but \nthat the world may be saved by Him.\" Therefore it was fitting that \nChrist, by miraculously healing men in particular, should prove Himself \nto be the universal and spiritual Saviour of all.",
        "RP1": "The means are distinct from the end. Now the end for which \nChrist's miracles were worked was the health of the rational part, which \nis healed by the light of wisdom, and the gift of righteousness: the \nformer of which presupposes the latter, since, as it is written (Wis. \n1:4): \"Wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body \nsubject to sins.\" Now it was unfitting that man should be made righteous \nunless he willed: for this would be both against the nature of \nrighteousness, which implies rectitude of the will, and contrary to the \nvery nature of man, which requires to be led to good by the free-will, \nnot by force. Christ, therefore, justified man inwardly by the Divine \npower, but not against man's will. Nor did this pertain to His miracles, \nbut to the end of His miracles. In like manner by the Divine power He \ninfused wisdom into the simple minds of His disciples: hence He said to \nthem (Lk. 21:15): \"I will give you a mouth and wisdom\" which \"all your \nadversaries will not be able to resist and gainsay.\" And this, in so far \nas the enlightenment was inward, is not to be reckoned as a miracle, but \nonly as regards the outward action---namely, in so far as men saw that \nthose who had been unlettered and simple spoke with such wisdom and \nconstancy. Wherefore it is written (Acts 4:13) that the Jews, \"seeing the \nconstancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate \nand ignorant men . . . wondered.\"---And though such like spiritual \neffects are different from visible miracles, yet do they testify to \nChrist's doctrine and power, according to Heb. 2:4: \"God also bearing \nthem witness by signs and wonders and divers miracles, and distributions \nof the Holy Ghost.\"\nNevertheless Christ did work some miracles on the soul of man, \nprincipally by changing its lower powers. Hence Jerome, commenting on Mt. \n9:9, \"He rose up and followed Him,\" says: \"Such was the splendor and \nmajesty of His hidden Godhead, which shone forth even in His human \ncountenance, that those who gazed on it were drawn to Him at first \nsight.\" And on Mt. 21:12, \"(Jesus) cast out all them that sold and \nbought,\" the same Jerome says: \"Of all the signs  worked by our Lord, \nthis seems to me the most wondrous---that one man, at that time despised, \ncould, with the blows of one scourge, cast out such a multitude. For a \nfiery and heavenly light flashed from His eyes, and the majesty of His \nGodhead shone in His countenance.\" And Origen says on Jn. 2:15 that \"this \nwas a greater miracle than when He changed water into wine, for there He \nshows His power over inanimate matter, whereas here He tames the minds of \nthousands of men.\" Again, on Jn. 18:6, \"They went backward and fell to \nthe ground,\" Augustine says: \"Though that crowd was fierce in hate and \nterrible with arms, yet did that one word . . . without any weapon, smite \nthem through, drive them back, lay them prostrate: for God lay hidden in \nthat flesh.\" Moreover, to this must be referred what Luke says (4:30) \n---namely, that Jesus, \"passing through the midst of them, went His way,\" \non which Chrysostom observes (Hom. xlviii in Joan.): \"That He stood in \nthe midst of those who were lying in wait for Him, and was not seized by \nthem, shows the power of His Godhead\"; and, again, that which is written \nJn. 8:59, \"Jesus hid Himself and went out of the Temple,\" on which \nTheophylact says: \"He did not hide Himself in a corner of the Temple, as \nif afraid, or take shelter behind a wall or pillar; but by His heavenly \npower making Himself invisible to those who were threatening Him, He \npassed through the midst of them.\"\nFrom all these instances it is clear that Christ, when He willed, \nchanged the minds of men by His Divine power, not only by the bestowal of \nrighteousness and the infusion of wisdom, which pertains to the end of \nmiracles, but also by outwardly drawing men to Himself, or by terrifying \nor stupefying them, which pertains to the miraculous itself.",
        "RP2": "Christ came to save the world, not only by Divine power, \nbut also through the mystery of His Incarnation. Consequently in healing \nthe sick He frequently not only made use of His Divine power, healing by \nway of command, but also by applying something pertaining to His human \nnature. Hence on Lk. 4:40, \"He, laying His hands on every one of them, \nhealed them,\" Cyril says: \"Although, as God, He might, by one word, have \ndriven out all diseases, yet He touched them, showing that His own flesh \nwas endowed with a healing virtue.\" And on Mk. 8:23, \"Spitting upon his \neyes, laying His hands on him,\" etc., Chrysostom [*Victor of Antioch] \nsays: \"He spat and laid His hands upon the blind man, wishing to show \nthat His Divine word, accompanied by His operation, works wonders: for \nthe hand signifies operation; the spittle signifies the word which \nproceeds from the mouth.\" Again, on Jn. 9:6, \"He made clay of the \nspittle, and spread the clay upon the eyes of the blind man,\" Augustine \nsays: \"Of His spittle He made clay---because 'the Word was made flesh.'\" \nOr, again, as Chrysostom says, to signify that it was He who made man of \n\"the slime of the earth.\"\nIt is furthermore to be observed concerning Christ's miracles that \ngenerally what He did was most perfect. Hence on Jn. 2:10, \"Every man at \nfirst setteth forth good wine,\" Chrysostom says: \"Christ's miracles are \nsuch as to far surpass the works of nature  in splendor and usefulness.\" \nLikewise in an instant He conferred perfect health on the sick. Hence on \nMt. 8:15, \"She arose and ministered to them,\" Jerome says: \"Health \nrestored by our Lord returns wholly and instantly.\"\nThere was, however, special reason for the contrary happening in the \ncase of the man born blind, and this was his want of faith, as Chrysostom \n[*Victor of Antioch] says. Or as Bede observes on Mk. 8:23: \"Whom He \nmight have healed wholly and instantly by a single word, He heals little \nby little, to show the extent of human blindness, which hardly, and that \nonly by degrees, can come back to the light: and to point out that each \nstep forward in the way of perfection is due to the help of His grace.\"",

But nothing \nis perfect except it attain its end. Now the end of the outward healing \nworked by Christ is the healing of the soul. Consequently it was not \nfitting that Christ should heal a man's body without healing his soul. \nWherefore on Jn. 7:23, \"I have healed the whole man on a Sabbath day,\" \nAugustine says: \"Because he was cured, so as to be whole in body; he \nbelieved, so as to be whole in soul.\" To the man sick of the palsy it is \nsaid specially, \"Thy sins are forgiven thee,\" because, as Jerome observes \non Mt. 9:5,6: \"We are hereby given to understand that ailments of the \nbody are frequently due to sin: for which reason, perhaps, first are his \nsins forgiven, that the cause of the ailment being removed, health may \nreturn.\" Wherefore, also (Jn. 4:14), it is said: \"Sin no more, lest some \nworse thing happen to thee.\" Whence, says Chrysostom, \"we learn that his \nsickness was the result of sin.\"\nNevertheless, as Chrysostom says on Mt. 9:5: \"By how much a soul is of \nmore account than a body, by so much is the forgiving of sins a greater \nwork than healing the body; but because the one is unseen He does the \nlesser and more manifest thing in order to prove the greater and more \nunseen.\"",

Mk. 5:19; Lk. 8:39), that is not contrary to this.

Or, again, it may be said fittingly \nthat it signifies the clarity of the world  redeemed, which clarity will \ncover the saints as a tent. Hence when Peter proposed to make tents, \"a \nbright cloud overshaded\" the disciples."

For Augustine thus writes (Questions. \nlxxxiii, qu. 25): \"God's Wisdom became man to give us an example in \nrighteousness of living. But it is part of righteous living not to stand \nin fear of things which ought not to be feared. Now there are some men \nwho, although they do not fear death in itself, are yet troubled over the \nmanner of their death. In order, then, that no kind of death should \ntrouble an upright man, the cross of this Man had to be set before him, \nbecause, among all kinds of death, none was more execrable, more \nfear-inspiring, than this.\"\nSecondly, because this kind of death was especially suitable in order to \natone for the sin of our first parent, which was the plucking of the \napple from the forbidden tree against God's command. And so, to atone for \nthat sin, it was fitting that Christ should suffer by being fastened to a \ntree, as if restoring what Adam had purloined; according to Ps. 68:5: \n\"Then did I pay that which I took not away.\" Hence Augustine says in a \nsermon on the  Passion [*Cf. Serm. ci De Tempore]: \"Adam despised the \ncommand, plucking the apple from the tree: but all that Adam lost, Christ \nfound upon the cross.\"\nThe third reason is because, as Chrysostom says in a sermon on the \nPassion (De Cruce et Latrone i, ii): \"He suffered upon a high rood and \nnot under a roof, in order that the nature of the air might be purified: \nand the earth felt a like benefit, for it was cleansed by the flowing of \nthe blood from His side.\" And on Jn. 3:14: \"The Son of man must be lifted \nup,\" Theophylact says: \"When you hear that He was lifted up, understand \nHis hanging on high, that He might sanctify the air who had sanctified \nthe earth by walking upon it.\"\nThe fourth reason is, because, by dying on it, He prepares for us an \nascent into heaven, as Chrysostom [*Athanasius, vide A, III, ad 2] says. \nHence it is that He says (Jn. 12:32): \"If I be lifted up from the earth, \nI will draw all things to Myself.\"\nThe fifth reason is because it is befitting the universal salvation of \nthe entire world. Hence Gregory of Nyssa observes (In Christ. Resurr., \nOrat. i) that \"the shape of the cross extending out into four extremes \nfrom their central point of contact denotes the power and the providence \ndiffused everywhere of Him who hung upon it.\" Chrysostom [*Athanasius, \nvide A. III, ad 2] also says that upon the cross \"He dies with \noutstretched hands in order to draw with one hand the people of old, and \nwith the other those who spring from the Gentiles.\"\nThe sixth reason is because of the various virtues denoted by this class \nof death. Hence Augustine in his book on the grace of the Old and New \nTestament (Ep. cxl) says: \"Not without purpose did He choose this class \nof death, that He might be a teacher of that breadth, and height, and \nlength, and depth,\" of which the Apostle speaks (Eph. 3:18): \"For breadth \nis in the beam, which is fixed transversely above; this appertains to \ngood works, since the hands are stretched out upon it. Length is the \ntree's extent from the beam to the ground; and there it is planted---that \nis, it stands and abides---which is the note of longanimity. Height is in \nthat portion of the tree which remains over from the transverse beam \nupwards to the top, and this is at the head of the Crucified, because He \nis the supreme desire of souls of good hope. But that part of the tree \nwhich is hidden from view to hold it fixed, and from which the entire \nrood springs, denotes the depth of gratuitous grace.\" And, as Augustine \nsays (Tract. cxix in Joan.): \"The tree upon which were fixed the members \nof Him dying was even the chair of the Master teaching.\"\nThe seventh reason is because this kind of death responds to very many \nfigures. For, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Passion (Serm. ci De \nTempore), an ark of wood preserved the human race from the waters of the \nDeluge; at the exodus of God's people from Egypt, Moses with a rod \ndivided the sea, overthrew Pharaoh and saved the people of God. the same \nMoses dipped his rod into the  water, changing it from bitter to sweet; \nat the touch of a wooden rod a salutary spring gushed forth from a \nspiritual rock; likewise, in order to overcome Amalec, Moses stretched \nforth his arms with rod in hand; lastly, God's law is entrusted to the \nwooden Ark of the Covenant; all of which are like steps by which we mount \nto the wood of the cross.",
        "RP1": "The altar of holocausts, upon which the sacrifices of \nanimals were immolated, was constructed of timbers, as is set forth Ex. \n27:, and in this respect the truth answers to the figure; but \"it is not \nnecessary for it to be likened in every respect, otherwise it would not \nbe a likeness,\" but the reality, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii). \nBut. in particular, as Chrysostom [*Athanasius, vide A, III, ad 2] says: \n\"His head is not cut off, as was done to John; nor was He sawn in twain, \nlike Isaias, in order that His entire and indivisible body might obey \ndeath, and that there might be no excuse for them who want to divide the \nChurch.\" While, instead of material fire, there was the spiritual fire of \ncharity in Christ's holocaust.",

        "RP3": "As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xiv), sin is accursed, \nand, consequently, so is death, and mortality, which comes of sin. \"But \nChrist's flesh was mortal, 'having the resemblance of the flesh of sin'\"; \nand hence Moses calls it \"accursed,\" just as the Apostle calls it \"sin,\" \nsaying (2 Cor. 5:21): \"Him that knew no sin, for us He hath made \nsin\"---namely, because of the penalty of sin. \"Nor is there greater \nignominy on that account, because he said: 'He is accursed of God.'\" For, \n\"unless God had hated sin, He would never have sent His Son to take upon \nHimself our death, and to destroy it. Acknowledge, then, that it was for \nus He took the curse upon Himself, whom you confess to have died for us.\" \nHence it is written (Gal. 3:13): \"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse \nof the law, being made a curse for us.\""

Therefore it seems that \nHe was \"inglorious,\" by enduring every human suffering.",

        "ANS": "Human sufferings may be considered under two aspects. \nFirst of all, specifically, and in this way it was not necessary for \nChrist to endure them all, since many are mutually exclusive, as burning \nand drowning; for we are dealing now with sufferings inflicted from \nwithout, since it was not beseeming for Him to endure those arising from \nwithin, such as bodily ailments, as already stated (Question [14], Article [4]). But, \nspeaking generically, He did endure every human suffering. This admits of \na threefold acceptance. First of all, on the part of men: for He endured \nsomething from Gentiles and from Jews; from men and from women, as is \nclear from the women servants who accused Peter. He suffered from the \nrulers, from their servants and from the mob, according to Ps. 2:1,2: \n\"Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things? The \nkings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the \nLord and against His Christ.\" He suffered from friends and acquaintances, \nas is manifest from Judas betraying and Peter denying Him.\nSecondly, the same is evident on the part of the sufferings which a man \ncan endure. For Christ suffered from friends abandoning Him; in His \nreputation, from the blasphemies hurled at Him; in His honor and glory, \nfrom the mockeries and the insults heaped upon Him; in things, for He was \ndespoiled of His garments; in His soul, from sadness, weariness, and \nfear; in His body, from wounds and scourgings.\nThirdly, it may be considered with regard to His bodily members. In His \nhead He suffered from the crown of piercing thorns; in His hands and \nfeet, from the fastening of the nails; on His face from the blows and \nspittle; and from the lashes over His entire body. Moreover, He suffered \nin all His bodily senses: in touch, by being scourged and nailed; in \ntaste, by being given vinegar and gall to drink; in smell, by being \nfastened to the gibbet in a place reeking with the stench of corpses, \n\"which is called Calvary\"; in hearing, by being tormented with the cries \nof blasphemers and scorners; in sight, by beholding the tears of His \nMother and of the disciple whom He loved.",

Hence it is that even others are \nmore deserving of blame if they do not compassionate him. according to \nIs. 57:1: \"The just perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart.\"\nReply to Objection 6: Christ willed to deliver the human race from sins not \nmerely by His power, but also according to justice.

        "ANS": "As we have stated, when treating of the defects assumed \nby Christ (Question [15], Articles [5],6), there was true and sensible pain in the \nsuffering Christ, which is caused by something hurtful to the body: also, \nthere was internal pain, which is caused from the apprehension of \nsomething hurtful, and this is termed \"sadness.\" And in Christ each of \nthese was the greatest in this present life. This arose from four causes. \nFirst of all, from the sources of His pain. For the cause of the \nsensitive pain was the wounding of His body; and this wounding had its \nbitterness, both from the extent of the suffering already mentioned (Article [5]) and from the kind of suffering, since the death of the crucified is \nmost bitter, because they are pierced in nervous and highly sensitive \nparts---to wit, the hands and feet; moreover, the weight of the suspended \nbody intensifies the agony. and besides this there is the duration of the \nsuffering because they do not die at once like those slain by the sword. \nThe cause of the interior pain was, first of all, all the sins of the \nhuman race, for which He made satisfaction by suffering; hence He \nascribes them, so to speak, to Himself, saying (Ps. 21:2): \"The words of \nmy sins.\" Secondly, especially the fall of the Jews and of the others who \nsinned in His death chiefly of the apostles, who were scandalized at His \nPassion. Thirdly, the loss of His bodily life, which is naturally \nhorrible to human nature.\nThe magnitude of His suffering may be considered, secondly, from the \nsusceptibility of the sufferer as to both soul and body. For His body was \nendowed with a most perfect constitution, since it was fashioned \nmiraculously by the operation of the Holy Ghost; just as some other \nthings made by miracles are better than others, as Chrysostom says (Hom. \nxxii in Joan.) respecting the wine into which Christ changed the water at \nthe wedding-feast. And, consequently, Christ's sense of touch, the \nsensitiveness of which is the reason for our feeling pain, was most \nacute. His soul likewise, from its interior powers, apprehended most \nvehemently all the causes of sadness.\nThirdly, the magnitude of Christ's suffering can be estimated from the \nsingleness of His pain and sadness. In other sufferers the interior \nsadness is mitigated, and even the exterior suffering, from some \nconsideration of reason, by some derivation or redundance from the higher \npowers into the lower; but it was not so with the suffering Christ, \nbecause \"He permitted each one of His powers to exercise its proper \nfunction,\" as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii).\nFourthly, the magnitude of the pain of Christ's suffering can be \nreckoned by this, that the pain and sorrow were accepted voluntarily, to \nthe end of men's deliverance from sin; and consequently He embraced the \namount of pain proportionate to the magnitude of the fruit which resulted \ntherefrom.\nFrom all these causes weighed together, it follows that Christ's pain \nwas the very greatest.",
        "RP1": "This argument follows from only one of the considerations \nadduced---namely, from the bodily injury, which is the cause of sensitive \npain; but the torment of the suffering Christ is much more intensified \nfrom other causes, as above stated.",
        "RP2": "Moral virtue lessens interior sadness in one way, and \noutward sensitive pain in quite another; for it lessens interior sadness \ndirectly by fixing the mean, as being its proper matter, within limits. \nBut, as was laid down in the FS, Question [64], Article [2], moral virtue fixes the mean \nin the passions, not according to mathematical quantity, but according to \nquantity of proportion, so that the passion shall not go beyond the rule \nof reason. And since the Stoics held all sadness to be unprofitable, they \naccordingly believed it to be altogether discordant with reason, and \nconsequently to be shunned altogether by a wise man. But in very truth \nsome sadness is praiseworthy, as Augustine proves (De Civ. Dei \nxiv)---namely, when it flows from holy love, as, for instance, when a man \nis saddened over his own or others' sins. Furthermore, it is employed as \na useful means of satisfying for sins, according to the saying of the \nApostle (2 Cor. 7:10): \"The sorrow that is according to God worketh \npenance, steadfast unto salvation.\" And so to atone for the sins of all \nmen, Christ accepted sadness, the greatest in absolute quantity, yet not \nexceeding the rule of reason. But moral virtue does not lessen outward \nsensitive pain, because such pain is not subject to reason, but follows \nthe nature of the body; yet it lessens it indirectly by redundance of the \nhigher powers into the lower. But this did not happen in Christ's case, \nas stated above (cf. Question [14], Article [1], ad 2; Question [45], Article [2]).",
        "RP3": "The pain of a suffering, separated soul belongs to the \nstate of future condemnation, which exceeds every evil of this life, just \nas the glory of the saints surpasses every good of the present life. \nAccordingly, when we say that Christ's pain was the greatest, we make no \ncomparison between His and the pain of a separated soul. But Adam's body \ncould not suffer, except he sinned. so that he would become mortal, and \npassible. And, though actually suffering, it would have felt less pain \nthan Christ's body, for the reasons already stated. From all this it is \nclear that even if by impassibility Adam had suffered in the state of \ninnocence, his pain would have been less than Christ's.",
        "RP4": "Christ grieved not only over the loss of His own bodily \nlife, but also over the sins of all others. And this grief in Christ \nsurpassed all grief of every contrite heart, both because it flowed from \na greater wisdom and charity, by which the pang of  contrition is \nintensified, and because He grieved at the one time for all sins, \naccording to Is. 53:4: \"Surely He hath carried our sorrows.\" But such was \nthe dignity of Christ's life in the body, especially on account of the \nGodhead united with it, that its loss, even for one hour, would be a \nmatter of greater grief than the loss of another man's life for howsoever \nlong a time. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii) that the man of \nvirtue loves his life all the more in proportion as he knows it to be \nbetter; and yet he exposes it for virtue's sake.

In another way a faculty suffers by \na passion in the subject on which it is based; as sight suffers when the \nsense of touch in the eye is affected, upon which the sense of sight \nrests, as, for instance, when the eye is pricked, or is disaffected by \nheat.\nSo, then, we say that if the soul be considered with respect to its \nessence, it is evident that Christ's whole soul suffered.

        "RP1": "Some hold that Christ did die on the fourteenth day of the \nmoon, when the Jews sacrificed the Pasch: hence it is stated (Jn. 18:28) \nthat the Jews \"went not into Pilate's hall\" on the day of the Passion, \n\"that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Pasch.\" Upon \nthis Chrysostom observes (Hom. lxxxii in Joan.): \"The Jews celebrated the \nPasch then; but He celebrated the Pasch on the previous day, reserving \nHis own slaying until the Friday, when the old Pasch was kept.\" And this \nappears to tally with the statement (Jn. 13:1-5) that \"before the \nfestival day of the Pasch . . . when supper was done\" . . . Christ washed \n\"the feet of the disciples.\"\nBut Matthew's account (26:17) seems opposed to this; that \"on the first \nday of the Azymes the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt Thou \nthat we prepare for Thee to eat the Pasch?\" From which, as Jerome says, \n\"since the fourteenth day of the first month is called the day of the \nAzymes, when the lamb was slain, and when it was full moon,\" it is quite \nclear that Christ kept the supper on the fourteenth and died on the \nfifteenth. And this comes out more clearly from Mk. 14:12: \"On the first \nday of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch,\" etc.; and \nfrom Lk. 22:7: \"The day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was \nnecessary that the Pasch should be killed.\"\nConsequently, then, others say that Christ ate the Pasch with His \ndisciples on the proper day---that is, on the fourteenth day of the \nmoon---\"showing thereby that up to the last day He was not opposed to the \nlaw,\" as Chrysostom says (Hom. lxxxi in Matth.): but that the Jews, being \nbusied in compassing Christ's death against the law, put off celebrating \nthe Pasch until the following day. And on this account it is said of them \nthat on the day of Christ's Passion they were unwilling to enter Pilate's \nhall, \"that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the \nPasch.\"\nBut even this solution does not tally with Mark, who says: \"On the first \nday of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch.\" \nConsequently Christ and the Jews celebrated the ancient Pasch at the one \ntime. And as Bede says on Lk. 22:7,8: \"Although Christ who is our Pasch \nwas slain on the following day---that is, on the fifteenth day of the \nmoon---nevertheless, on the night when the Lamb was sacrificed, \ndelivering to the disciples to be celebrated, the mysteries of His body \nand blood, and being held and bound by the Jews, He hallowed the opening \nof His own immolation---that is, of His Passion.\"\nBut the words (Jn. 13:1) \"Before the festival day of the Pasch\" are to \nbe understood to refer to the fourteenth day of the moon, which then fell \nupon the Thursday: for the fifteenth day of the moon was the most solemn \nday of the Pasch with the Jews: and so the same day which John calls \n\"before the festival day of the Pasch,\" on account of the natural \ndistinction of days, Matthew calls the first day of the unleavened bread, \nbecause, according to the rite of the Jewish festivity, the solemnity \nbegan from the evening of the preceding day. When it is said, then, that \nthey were going to eat the Pasch on the fifteenth day of the month, it is \nto be understood that the Pasch there is not called the Paschal lamb, \nwhich was sacrificed on the fourteenth day, but the Paschal food---that \nis, the unleavened bread---which had to be eaten by the clean. Hence \nChrysostom in the same passage gives another explanation, that the Pasch \ncan be taken as meaning the whole feast of the Jews, which lasted seven \ndays.",
        "RP2": "As Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. iii): \"'It was about \nthe sixth hour' when the Lord was delivered up by Pilate to be \ncrucified,\" as John relates. For it \"was not quite the sixth hour, but \nabout the sixth---that is, it was after the fifth, and when part of the \nsixth had been entered upon until the sixth hour was ended---that the \ndarkness began, when Christ hung upon the cross. It is understood to have \nbeen the third hour when the Jews clamored for the Lord to be crucified: \nand it is most clearly shown that they crucified Him when they clamored \nout. Therefore, lest anyone might divert the thought of so great a crime \nfrom the Jews to the soldiers, he says: 'It was the third hour, and they \ncrucified Him,' that they before all may be found to have crucified Him, \nwho at the third hour clamored for His crucifixion. Although there are \nnot wanting some persons who wish the Parasceve to be understood as the \nthird hour, which John recalls, saying: 'It was the Parasceve, about the \nsixth hour.' For 'Parasceve' is interpreted 'preparation.' But the true \nPasch, which was celebrated in the Lord's Passion, began to be prepared \nfrom the ninth hour of the night---namely, when the chief priests said: \n'He is deserving of death.'\" According to John, then, \"the sixth hour of \nthe Parasceve\" lasts from that hour of the night down to Christ's \ncrucifixion; while, according to Mark, it is the third hour of the day.\nStill, there are some who contend that this discrepancy is due  to the \nerror of a Greek transcriber: since the characters employed by them to \nrepresent 3 and 6 are somewhat alike.",
        "RP3": "According to the author of De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. \nlv, \"our Lord willed to redeem and reform the world by His Passion, at \nthe time of year at which He had created it---that is, at the equinox. It \nis then that day grows upon night; because by our Saviour's Passion we \nare brought from darkness to light.\" And since the perfect enlightening \nwill come about at Christ's second coming, therefore the season of His \nsecond coming is compared (Mt. 24:32,33) to the summer in these words: \n\"When the branch thereof is now tender, and the leaves come forth, you \nknow that summer is nigh: so you also, when you shall see all these \nthings, know ye that it is nigh even at the doors.\" And then also shall \nbe Christ's greatest exaltation.",
        "RP4": "Christ willed to suffer while yet young, for three reasons. \nFirst of all, to commend the more His love by giving up His life for us \nwhen He was in His most perfect state of life. Secondly, because it was \nnot becoming for Him to show any decay of nature nor to be subject to \ndisease, as stated above (Question [14], Article [4]). Thirdly, that by dying and rising \nat an early age Christ might exhibit beforehand in His own person the \nfuture condition of those who rise again. Hence it is written (Eph. 4:13): \"Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge \nof the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the \nfulness of Christ.\""

        "OB2": "Further, the reality ought to correspond with the figure. But \nChrist's Passion was prefigured by the sacrifices of the Old Law, and \nthese were offered up in the Temple. Therefore it seems that Christ ought \nto have suffered in the Temple, and not outside the city gate.",
        "OB3": "Further, the medicine should correspond with the disease. But \nChrist's Passion was the medicine against Adam's sin: and Adam was not \nburied in Jerusalem, but in Hebron; for it is written (Josue 14:15): \"The \nname of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: Adam the greatest in the \nland of [Vulg.: 'among'] the Enacims was laid there.\"",
        "CON": "It is written (Lk. 13:33): \"It cannot be that a prophet \nperish out of Jerusalem.\" Therefore it was fitting that He should die in \nJerusalem.",

        "RP1": "Christ died most appropriately in Jerusalem. First of all, \nbecause Jerusalem was God's chosen place for the offering of sacrifices \nto Himself: and these figurative sacrifices foreshadowed Christ's \nPassion, which is a true sacrifice, according to Eph. 5:2: \"He hath \ndelivered Himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odor \nof sweetness.\" Hence Bede says in a Homily (xxiii): \"When the Passion \ndrew nigh, our Lord willed to draw nigh to the place of the \nPassion\"---that is to say, to Jerusalem---whither He came five days \nbefore the Pasch; just as, according to the legal precept, the Paschal \nlamb was led to the place of immolation five days before the Pasch, which \nis the tenth day of the moon.\nSecondly, because the virtue of His Passion was to be spread over the \nwhole world, He wished to suffer in the center of the habitable \nworld---that is, in Jerusalem. Accordingly it is written (Ps. 73:12): \n\"But God is our King before ages: He hath wrought salvation in the midst \nof the earth\"---that is, in Jerusalem, which is called \"the navel of the \nearth\" [*Cf. Jerome's comment on Ezech. 5:5].\nThirdly, because it was specially in keeping with His humility: that, as \nHe chose the most shameful manner of death, so likewise it was part of \nHis humility that He did not refuse to suffer in so celebrated a place. \nHence Pope Leo says (Serm. I in Epiph.): \"He who had taken upon Himself \nthe form of a servant chose Bethlehem for His nativity and Jerusalem for \nHis Passion.\"\nFourthly, He willed to suffer in Jerusalem, where the chief priests \ndwelt, to show that the wickedness of His slayers arose from the chiefs \nof the Jewish people. Hence it is written (Acts 4:27): \"There assembled \ntogether in this city against Thy holy child Jesus whom Thou hast \nanointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of \nIsrael.\"",
        "RP2": "For three reasons Christ suffered outside the gate, and not \nin the Temple nor in the city. First of all, that the truth might \ncorrespond with the figure. For the calf and the goat which were offered \nin most solemn sacrifice for expiation on behalf of the entire multitude \nwere burnt outside the camp, as commanded in Lev. 16:27. Hence it is \nwritten (Heb. 13:27): \"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is \nbrought into the holies by the high-priest for sin, are burned without \nthe camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people by His \nown blood, suffered without the gate.\"\nSecondly, to set us the example of shunning worldly conversation. \nAccordingly the passage continues: \"Let us go forth  therefore to Him \nwithout the camp, bearing His reproach.\"\nThirdly, as Chrysostom says in a sermon on the Passion (Hom. i De Cruce \net Latrone): \"The Lord was not willing to suffer under a roof, nor in the \nJewish Temple, lest the Jews might take away the saving sacrifice, and \nlest you might think He was offered for that people only. Consequently, \nit was beyond the city and outside the walls, that you may learn it was a \nuniversal sacrifice, an oblation for the whole world, a cleansing for \nall.\"",
        "RP3": "According to Jerome, in his commentary on Mt. 27:33, \n\"someone explained 'the place of Calvary' as being the place where Adam \nwas buried; and that it was so called because the skull of the first man \nwas buried there. A pleasing interpretation indeed, and one suited to \ncatch the ear of the people, but, still, not the true one. For the spots \nwhere the condemned are beheaded are outside the city and beyond the \ngates, deriving thence the name of Calvary---that is, of the beheaded. \nJesus, accordingly, was crucified there, that the standards of martyrdom \nmight be uplifted over what was formerly the place of the condemned. But \nAdam was buried close by Hebron and Arbe, as we read in the book of Jesus \nBen Nave.\" But Jesus was to be crucified in the common spot of the \ncondemned rather than beside Adam's sepulchre, to make it manifest that \nChrist's cross was the remedy, not only for Adam's personal sin, but also \nfor the sin of the entire world."

But it did not happen \nso; because mention is never made of them; whereas His cross is honored \neverywhere.

And \ntherefore, as stated above (Question [16], Article [4]), the Passion is to be attributed \nto the suppositum of the Divine Nature, not because of the Divine Nature, \nwhich is impassible, but by reason of the human nature.

Ephes., P. i, cap. 26] we read: \"If \nany man does not confess that the Word of God suffered in the flesh and \nwas crucified in the flesh, let him be anathema.\" Therefore Christ's \nPassion belongs to the \"suppositum\" of the Divine Nature by reason of the \npassible nature assumed, but not on account of the impassible Divine \nNature.",

In another \nway someone causes an effect indirectly---that is, by not preventing it \nwhen he can do so; just as one person is said to drench another by not \nclosing the window through which the shower is entering: and in this way \nChrist was the cause of His own Passion and death. For He could have \nprevented His Passion and death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in \ncheck, so that they would not have been eager to slay Him, or would have \nbeen powerless to do so. Secondly, because His spirit had the power of \npreserving His fleshly nature from the infliction of any injury; and \nChrist's soul had this power, because it was united in unity of person \nwith the Divine Word, as Augustine says (De Trin. iv).

Accordingly it is written (Mk. 15:39): \"And the centurion who \nstood over against Him, seeing that crying out in this manner, He had \ngiven up the ghost, said: Indeed, this man was the Son of God.\" It was \nalso a subject of wonder in Christ's death that He died sooner than the \nothers who were tormented with the same suffering.

Secondly, it was suitable for reconciling man with God: \nhence it is written (Rm. 5:10): \"We are reconciled to God by the death of \nHis Son,\" in so far as Christ's death was a most acceptable sacrifice to \nGod, according to Eph. 5:2: \"He delivered Himself for us an oblation and \na sacrifice to God for an odor of sweetness.\" Now obedience is preferred \nto all sacrifices. according to 1 Kgs. 15:22: \"Obedience is better than \nsacrifices.\" Therefore it was fitting that the sacrifice of Christ's \nPassion and death should proceed from obedience.

Yet because the Old Law \nwas ended by Christ's death, according to His dying words, \"It is \nconsummated\" (Jn. 19:30), it may be understood that by His suffering He \nfulfilled all the precepts of the Old Law. He fulfilled those of the \nmoral order which are founded on the precepts of charity, inasmuch as He \nsuffered both out of love of the Father, according to Jn. 14:31: \"That \nthe world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given \nMe commandment, so do I: arise, let us go hence\"---namely, to the place \nof His Passion: and out of love of His neighbor, according to Gal. 2:20: \n\"He loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.\" Christ likewise by His \nPassion fulfilled the ceremonial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly \nordained for sacrifices and oblations, in so far as all the ancient \nsacrifices were figures of that true sacrifice which the dying Christ \noffered  for us. Hence it is written (Col. 2:16,17): \"Let no man judge \nyou in meat or drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new \nmoon, or of the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the \nbody is Christ's,\" for the reason that Christ is compared to them as a \nbody is to a shadow. Christ also by His Passion fulfilled the judicial \nprecepts of the Law, which are chiefly ordained for making compensation \nto them who have suffered wrong, since, as is written Ps. 68:5: He \"paid \nthat which\" He \"took not away,\" suffering Himself to be fastened to a \ntree on account of the apple which man had plucked from the tree against \nGod's command.",

Moreover, if it were to be said that \nChrist's dead body did continue \"totally\" the same, it would follow that \nit was not corrupted---I mean, by the corruption of death: which is the \nheresy of the Gaianites, as Isidore says (Etym. viii), and is to be found \nin the Decretals (xxiv, qu. iii). And Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii) \nthat \"the term 'corruption' denotes two things: in one way it is the \nseparation of the soul from the body and other things of the sort; in \nanother way, the complete dissolving into elements. Consequently it is \nimpious to say with Julian and Gaian that the Lord's body was \nincorruptible after the first manner of corruption before the \nresurrection: because Christ's body would not be consubstantial with us, \nnor truly dead, nor would we have been saved in very truth.

Hence \nDamascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): \"As He evangelized them who are upon \nthe earth, so did He those who were in hell\"; not in order to convert \nunbelievers unto belief, but to put them to shame for their unbelief, \nsince preaching cannot be understood otherwise than as the open \nmanifesting of His Godhead. which was laid bare before them in the lower \nregions by His descending in power into hell.\nAugustine, however, furnishes a better exposition of the text in his \nEpistle to Evodius quoted above, namely, that the preaching is not to be \nreferred to Christ's descent into hell, but to the operation of His \nGodhead, to which He gave effect from the beginning of the world. \nConsequently, the sense is, that \"to those (spirits) that were in \nprison\"---that is, living in the mortal body, which is, as it were, the \nsoul's prison-house---\"by the spirit\" of His Godhead \"He came and \npreached\" by internal inspirations, and from without by the admonitions \nspoken by the righteous: to those, I say, He preached \"which had been \nsome time incredulous,\" i.e. not believing in the preaching of Noe, \"when \nthey waited for the patience of God,\" whereby the chastisement of the \nDeluge was put off: accordingly (Peter) adds: \"In the days of Noe, when \nthe Ark was being built.\"",

First \nof all; for the commendation of Divine Justice, to which it belongs to \nexalt them who humble themselves for God's sake, according to Lk. 1:52: \n\"He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the \nhumble.\" Consequently, because Christ humbled Himself even to the death \nof the Cross, from love and obedience to God, it behooved Him to be \nuplifted by God to a glorious resurrection; hence it is said in His \nPerson (Ps. 138:2): \"Thou hast known,\" i.e. approved, \"my sitting down,\" \ni.e. My humiliation and Passion, \"and my rising up,\" i.e. My \nglorification in the resurrection; as the gloss expounds.\nSecondly, for our instruction in the faith, since our belief in Christ's \nGodhead is confirmed by His rising again, because, according to 2 Cor. \n13:4, \"although He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the \npower of God.\" And therefore it is written (1 Cor. 15:14): \"If Christ be \nnot risen again, then is our preaching vain, and our [Vulg.: 'your'] \nfaith is also vain\": and (Ps. 29:10): \"What profit is there in my blood?\" \nthat is, in the shedding of My blood, \"while I go down,\" as by various \ndegrees of evils, \"into corruption?\" As though He were to answer: \"None. \n'For if I do not at once rise again but My body be corrupted, I shall \npreach to no one, I shall gain no one,'\" as the gloss expounds.\nThirdly, for the raising of our hope, since through seeing Christ, who \nis our head, rise again, we hope that we likewise shall rise again. Hence \nit is written (1 Cor. 15:12): \"Now if Christ be preached that He rose \nfrom the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection \nof the dead?\" And (Job 19:25,27): \"I know,\" that is with certainty of \nfaith, \"that my Redeemer,\" i.e. Christ, \"liveth,\" having risen from the \ndead; \"and\" therefore \"in the last day I shall rise out of the earth . . \n. this my hope is laid up in my bosom.\"\nFourthly, to set in order the lives of the faithful: according to Rm. \n6:4: \"As Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we \nalso may walk in newness of life\": and further on; \"Christ rising from \nthe dead dieth now no more; so do you also reckon that you are dead to \nsin, but alive to God.\"\nFifthly, in order to complete the work of our salvation: because, just \nas for this reason did He endure evil things in dying that He might \ndeliver us from evil, so was He glorified in rising again in order to \nadvance us towards good things; according to Rm. 4:25: \"He was delivered \nup for our sins, and rose again for our justification.\"",

SS, Question [2], Articles [7],8). Consequently, in order that our faith in the \ntruth of His Godhead might be confirmed it was necessary that He should \nrise speedily, and that His Resurrection should not be deferred until the \nend of the world. But to confirm our faith regarding the truth of His \nhumanity and death, it was needful that there should be some interval \nbetween His death and rising. For if He had risen directly after death, \nit might seem that His death was not genuine and consequently neither \nwould His Resurrection be true. But to establish the truth of Christ's \ndeath, it was enough for His rising to be deferred until the third day, \nfor within that time some signs of life always appear in one who appears \nto be dead whereas he is alive.\nFurthermore, by His rising on the third day, the perfection of the \nnumber \"three\" is commended, which is \"the number of everything,\" as \nhaving \"beginning, middle, and end,\" as is said in De Coelo i.

Moreover the third state of the saints began \nwith the Resurrection of Christ: for, the first was under figures of the \nLaw; the second under the truth of faith; while the third will be in the \neternity of glory, which Christ inaugurated by rising again.",

And a task is said to be done \"at once\" which is performed within \na short space of time.",
        "RP3": "As stated above (Question [51], Article [4], ad 1,2), Christ rose early \nwhen the day was beginning to dawn, to denote that by His Resurrection He \nbrought us to the light of glory; just as He died when the day was \ndrawing to its close, and nearing to darkness, in order to signify that \nby His death He would destroy the darkness of sin and its punishment. \nNevertheless He is said to have risen on the third day, taking day as a \nnatural day which contains twenty-four hours. And as Augustine says (De \nTrin. iv): \"The night until the dawn, when the Lord's Resurrection was \nproclaimed, belongs to the third day. Because God, who made the light to \nshine forth from darkness, in order that by the grace of the New \nTestament and partaking of Christ's rising we might hear this---'once ye \nwere darkness, but now light in the Lord'---insinuates in a measure to us \nthat day draws its origin from night: for, as the first days are computed \nfrom light to darkness on account of man's coming fall, so these days are \nreckoned from darkness to light owing to man's restoration.\" And so it is \nevident that even if He had risen at midnight, He could be said to have \nrisen on the third day, taking it as a natural day. But now that He rose \nearly, it can be affirmed that He rose on the third day, even taking the \nartificial day which is caused by the sun's presence, because the sun had \nalready begun to brighten the sky. Hence it is written (Mk. 16:2) that \n\"the women come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen\"; which is not \ncontrary to John's statement \"when it was yet dark,\" as Augustine says \n(De Cons. Evang. iii), \"because, as the day advances the more the light \nrises, the more are the remaining shadows dispelled.\" But when Mark says \n\"'the sun being now risen,' it is not to be taken as if the sun were \nalready apparent over the horizon, but as coming presently into those \nparts.\""

Now a man \nis snatched from death in two ways: first of all, from actual death, so \nthat he begins in any way to live anew after being actually dead: in \nanother way, so that he is not only rescued from death, but from the \nnecessity, nay more, from the possibility of dying again. Such is a true \nand perfect resurrection, because so long as a man lives, subject to the \nnecessity of dying, death has dominion over him in a measure, according \nto Rm. 8:10: \"The body indeed is dead because of sin.\" Furthermore, what \nhas the possibility of existence, is said to exist in some respect, that \nis, in potentiality. Thus it is evident that the resurrection, whereby \none is rescued from actual death only, is but an imperfect one.\nConsequently, speaking of perfect resurrection, Christ is the first of \nthem who rise, because by rising He was the first to attain life utterly \nimmortal, according to Rm. 6:9: \"Christ rising from the dead dieth now no \nmore.\" But by an imperfect resurrection, some others have risen before \nChrist, so as to be a kind of figure of His Resurrection.\nAnd thus the answer to the first objection is clear: because both those \nraised from the dead in the old Testament, and those raised by Christ, so \nreturned to life that they had to die again.",
        "RP2": "There are two opinions regarding them who rose with Christ. \nSome hold that they rose to life so as to die no more, because it would \nbe a greater torment for them to die a second time than not to rise at \nall. According to this view, as Jerome observes on Mt. 27:52,53, we must \nunderstand that \"they had not risen before our Lord rose.\" Hence the \nEvangelist says that \"coming out of the tombs after His Resurrection, \nthey came into the holy city, and appeared to many.\" But Augustine (Ep. \nad Evod. clxiv) while giving this opinion, says: \"I know that it appears \nsome, that by the death of Christ the Lord the same resurrection was \nbestowed upon the righteous as is promised to us in the end; and if they \nslept not  again by laying aside their bodies, it remains to be seen how \nChrist can be understood to be 'the first-born of the dead,' if so many \npreceded Him unto that resurrection. Now if reply be made that this is \nsaid by anticipation, so that the monuments be understood to have been \nopened by the earthquake while Christ was still hanging on the cross, but \nthat the bodies of the just did not rise then but after He had risen, the \ndifficulty still arises---how is it that Peter asserts that it was \npredicted not of David but of Christ, that His body would not see \ncorruption, since David's tomb was in their midst; and thus he did not \nconvince them, if David's body was no longer there; for even if he had \nrisen soon after his death, and his flesh had not seen corruption, his \ntomb might nevertheless remain. Now it seems hard that David from whose \nseed Christ is descended, was not in that rising of the just, if an \neternal rising was conferred upon them. Also that saying in the Epistle \nto the Hebrews (11:40) regarding the ancient just would be hard to \nexplain, 'that they should not be perfected without us,' if they were \nalready established in that incorruption of the resurrection which is \npromised at the end when we shall be made perfect\": so that Augustine \nwould seem to think that they rose to die again. In this sense Jerome \nalso in commenting on Matthew (27:52,53) says: \"As Lazarus rose, so also \nmany of the bodies of the saints rose, that they might bear witness to \nthe risen Christ.\" Nevertheless in a sermon for the Assumption [*Ep. ix \nad Paul. et Eustoch.; among the supposititious works ascribed to St. \nJerome] he seems to leave the matter doubtful.

Moreover \nChrist had this not only from the condition of His glorified body, but \nalso from the power of His Godhead, by which power it may happen that \neven bodies not glorified are miraculously unseen: as was by a miracle \nbestowed on the blessed Bartholomew, that \"if he wished he could be seen, \nand not be seen if he did not wish it\" [*Apocryphal Historia Apost. viii, \n2].

But in the resurrection the saints will have glorified \nbodies, as is written in the same place: \"It is sown in dishonor, it \nshall rise in glory.\" Hence, since the cause is mightier than the effect, \nand the exemplar than the exemplate; much more glorious, then, was the \nbody of Christ in His Resurrection. Secondly, because He merited the \nglory of His Resurrection by the lowliness of His Passion. Hence He said \n(Jn. 12:27): \"Now is My soul troubled,\" which refers to the Passion; and \nlater He adds: \"Father, glorify Thy name,\" whereby He asks for the glory \nof the Resurrection. Thirdly, because as stated above (Question [34], Article [4]), \nChrist's soul was glorified from the instant of His conception by perfect \nfruition of the Godhead. But, as stated above (Question [14], Article [1], ad 2), it was \nowing to the Divine economy that the glory did not pass from His soul to \nHis body, in order that by the Passion He might accomplish the mystery of \nour redemption. Consequently, when this mystery of Christ's Passion and \ndeath was finished, straightway the soul communicated its glory to the \nrisen body in the Resurrection; and so that body was made glorious.",
        "RP1": "Whatever is received within a subject is received according \nto the subject's capacity. Therefore, since glory flows from the soul \ninto the body, it follows that, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor. \ncxviii), the brightness or splendor of a glorified body is after the \nmanner of natural color in the human body; just as variously colored \nglass derives its splendor from the sun's radiance, according to the mode \nof the color. But as it lies within the power of a glorified man whether \nhis body be seen or not, as stated above (Article [1], ad 2), so is it in his \npower whether its splendor  be seen or not. Accordingly it can be seen in \nits color without its brightness. And it was in this way that Christ's \nbody appeared to the disciples after the Resurrection.",

But from rarity and \ndensity follow weight and lightness, heat and cold, and similar \ncontraries, which are the principles of corruption in elementary bodies. \nConsequently, a body that can be handled by human touch is naturally \ncorruptible. But if there be a body that resists touch, and yet is not \ndisposed according to the qualities mentioned, which are the proper \nobjects of human touch, such as a heavenly body, then such body cannot be \nsaid to be handled. But Christ's body after the Resurrection was truly \nmade up of elements, and had tangible qualities such as the nature of a \nhuman body requires, and therefore it could naturally be handled; and if \nit had nothing beyond the nature of a human body, it would likewise be \ncorruptible. But it had something else which made it incorruptible, and \nthis was not the nature of a heavenly body, as some maintain, and into \nwhich we shall make fuller inquiry later (XP, Question [82], Article [1]), but it was \nglory flowing from a beatified soul: because, as Augustine says (Ep. ad \nDioscor. cxviii): \"God made the soul of such powerful nature, that from \nits fullest beatitude the fulness of health overflows into the body, that \nis, the vigor of incorruption.\" And therefore Gregory says (Hom. in \nEvang. xxvi): \"Christ's body is shown to be of the same nature, but of \ndifferent glory, after the Resurrection.\"",

Now it is clear that flesh, bones, blood, and other \nsuch things, are of the very nature of the human body. Consequently, all \nthese things were in Christ's body when He rose again; and this also \nintegrally, without any diminution; otherwise it would not have been a \ncomplete resurrection, if whatever was lost by death had not been \nrestored. Hence our Lord assured His faithful ones by saying (Mt. 10:30): \n\"The very hairs of your head are all numbered\": and (Lk. 21:18): \"A hair \nof your head shall not perish.\"\nBut to say that Christ's body had neither flesh, nor bones, nor the \nother natural parts of a human body, belongs to the error of Eutyches, \nBishop of Constantinople, who maintained that \"our body in that glory of \nthe resurrection will be impalpable, and more subtle than wind and air: \nand that our Lord, after the hearts of the disciples who handled Him were \nconfirmed, brought back to subtlety whatever could be handled in Him\" \n[*St. Gregory, Moral. in Job 14:56]. Now Gregory condemns this in the \nsame book, because Christ's body was not changed after the Resurrection, \naccording to Rm. 6:9: \"Christ rising from the dead, dieth now no more.\" \nAccordingly, the very man who had said these things, himself retracted \nthem at his death. For, if it be unbecoming for Christ to take a body of \nanother nature in His conception, a heavenly one for instance, as \nValentine asserted, it is much more unbecoming for Him at His \nResurrection to resume a body of another nature, because in His \nResurrection He resumed unto an everlasting life, the body which in His \nconception He had assumed to a mortal life.",

Therefore it seems that when \nthe disciples were assured of the Resurrection, He bore the scars no \nlonger.

For Bede says on Lk. 24:40 that He kept His scars not from \ninability to heal them, \"but to wear them as an everlasting trophy of His \nvictory.\" Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii): \"Perhaps in that \nkingdom we shall see on the bodies of the Martyrs the traces of the \nwounds which they bore for Christ's name: because it will not be a \ndeformity, but a dignity in them; and a certain kind of beauty will shine \nin them, in the body, though not of the body.\" Secondly, to confirm the \nhearts of the disciples as to \"the faith in His Resurrection\" (Bede, on \nLk. 24:40). Thirdly, \"that when He pleads for us with the Father, He may \nalways show the manner of death He endured for us\" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). \nFourthly, \"that He may convince those redeemed in His blood, how \nmercifully they have been helped, as He exposes before them the traces of \nthe same death\" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). Lastly, \"that in the Judgment-day \nHe may upbraid them with their just condemnation\" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). \nHence, as Augustine says (De Symb. ii): \"Christ knew why He kept the \nscars in His body. For, as He showed them to Thomas who would not believe \nexcept he handled and saw them, so will He show His wounds to His \nenemies, so that He who is the Truth may convict them, saying: 'Behold \nthe man whom you crucified; see the wounds you inflicted; recognize the \nside you pierced, since it was opened by you and for you, yet you would \nnot enter.'\"",
        "RP1": "The scars that remained in Christ's body belong neither to \ncorruption nor defect, but to the greater increase of glory, inasmuch as \nthey are the trophies of His power; and a special comeliness will appear \nin the places scarred by the wounds.",
        "RP2": "Although those openings of the wounds break the continuity \nof the tissue, still the greater beauty of glory compensates for all \nthis, so that the body is not less entire, but more perfected. Thomas, \nhowever, not only saw, but handled the wounds, because as Pope Leo [*Cf. \nAppend. Opp. August., Serm. clxii] says: \"It sufficed for his personal \nfaith for him to have seen what he saw; but it was on our behalf that he \ntouched what he beheld.\"",
        "RP3": "Christ willed the scars of His wounds to remain on His \nbody, not only to confirm the faith of His disciples, but for other \nreasons also. From these it seems that those scars will always remain on \nHis body; because, as Augustine says (Ad Consent., De Resurr. Carn.): \"I \nbelieve our Lord's body to be in heaven, such as it was when He ascended \ninto heaven.\" And Gregory (Moral. xiv) says that \"if aught could be \nchanged in Christ's body after His Resurrection, contrary to Paul's \ntruthful teaching, then the Lord after His Resurrection returned to \ndeath; and what fool would dare to say this, save he that denies the true \nresurrection of the flesh?\" Accordingly, it is evident that the scars \nwhich Christ showed on His body after His Resurrection, have never since \nbeen removed from His body."

Or as Augustine writes (De \nConsens. Evang. iii): \"What was said by the angel and by our Lord---that \nHe would 'go before them into Galilee,' must be taken prophetically. For \nif we take Galilee as meaning 'a passing,' we must understand that they \nwere going to pass from the people of Israel to the Gentiles, who would \nnot believe in the preaching of the apostles unless He prepared the way \nfor them in men's hearts: and this is signified by the words 'He shall go \nbefore you into Galilee.' But if by Galilee we understand 'revelation,' \nwe are to understand this as applying to Him not in the form of a \nservant, but in that form wherein He is equal to the Father, and which He \nhas promised to them that love Him.

Prior. Anal. ii; Rhetor. \ni]. Taking \"proof\" in the first sense, Christ did not demonstrate His \nResurrection to the disciples by proofs, because such argumentative proof \nwould have to be grounded on some principles: and if these were not known \nto the disciples, nothing would thereby be demonstrated to them, because \nnothing can be known from the unknown. And if such principles were known \nto them, they would not go beyond human reason, and consequently would \nnot be efficacious for establishing faith in the  Resurrection, which is \nbeyond human reason, since principles must be assumed which are of the \nsame order, according to 1 Poster. But it was from the authority of the \nSacred Scriptures that He proved to them the truth of His Resurrection, \nwhich authority is the basis of faith, when He said: \"All things must \nneeds be fulfilled which are written in the Law, and in the prophets, and \nin the Psalms, concerning Me\": as is set forth Lk. 24:44.\nBut if the term \"proof\" be taken in the second sense, then Christ is \nsaid to have demonstrated His Resurrection by proofs, inasmuch as by most \nevident signs He showed that He was truly risen. Hence where our version \nhas \"by many proofs,\" the Greek text, instead of proof has {tekmerion}, \ni.e. \"an evident sign affording positive proof\" [*Cf. Prior. Anal. ii]. \nNow Christ showed these signs of the Resurrection to His disciples, for \ntwo reasons.

Hence He says Himself (Lk. 24:25): \"O foolish and slow of heart to believe\": and (Mk. 16:14): \"He \nupbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart.\" Secondly, \nthat their testimony might be rendered more efficacious through the signs \nshown them, according to 1 Jn. 1:1,3: \"That which we have seen, and have \nheard, and our hands have handled . . . we declare.\"",

        "RP3": "As stated already (ad 2), the merit of beatitude, which \ncomes of faith, is not entirely excluded except a man refuse to believe \nonly such things as he can see.

For in order to manifest His Resurrection He made use \nof a double testimony, neither of which  can be rebutted. The first of \nthese was the angels' testimony, who announced the Resurrection to the \nwomen, as is seen in all the Evangelists: the other was the testimony of \nthe Scriptures, which He set before them to show the truth of the \nResurrection, as is narrated in the last chapter of Luke.\nAgain, the proofs were sufficient for showing that the Resurrection was \nboth true and glorious. That it was a true Resurrection He shows first on \nthe part of the body; and this He shows in three respects; first of all, \nthat it was a true and solid body, and not phantastic or rarefied, like \nthe air. And He establishes this by offering His body to be handled; \nhence He says in the last chapter of Luke (39): \"Handle and see; for a \nspirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have.\" Secondly, He \nshows that it was a human body, by presenting His true features for them \nto behold. Thirdly, He shows that it was identically the same body which \nHe had before, by showing them the scars of the wounds; hence, as we read \nin the last chapter of Luke (39) he said to them: \"See My hands and feet, \nthat it is I Myself.\"\nSecondly, He showed them the truth of His Resurrection on the part of \nHis soul reunited with His body: and He showed this by the works of the \nthreefold life. First of all, in the operations of the nutritive life, by \neating and drinking with His disciples, as we read in the last chapter of \nLuke. Secondly, in the works of the sensitive life, by replying to His \ndisciples' questions, and by greeting them when they were in His \npresence, showing thereby that He both saw and heard; thirdly, in the \nworks of the intellective life by their conversing with Him, and \ndiscoursing on the Scriptures. And, in order that nothing might be \nwanting to make the manifestation complete, He also showed that He had \nthe Divine Nature, by working the miracle of the draught of fishes, and \nfurther by ascending into heaven while they were beholding Him: because, \naccording to Jn. 3:13: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that \ndescended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.\"\nHe also showed His disciples the glory of His Resurrection by entering \nin among them when the doors were closed: as Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in \nEvang.): \"Our Lord allowed them to handle His flesh which He had brought \nthrough closed doors, to show that His body was of the same nature but of \ndifferent glory.\" It likewise was part of the property of glory that \"He \nvanished suddenly from their eyes,\" as related in the last chapter of \nLuke; because thereby it was shown that it lay in His power to be seen or \nnot seen; and this belongs to a glorified body, as stated above (Question [54], Article [1], ad 2, Article [2], ad 1).",

As to the angels who appeared, they did not say \nthey were men, as Christ asserted that  He was truly a man. Moreover, the \nmanner of eating was different in Christ and the angels: for since the \nbodies assumed by the angels were neither living nor animated, there was \nno true eating, although the food was really masticated and passed into \nthe interior of the assumed body: hence the angels said to Tobias \n(12:18,19): \"When I was with you . . . I seemed indeed to eat and drink \nwith you; but I use an invisible meat.\" But since Christ's body was truly \nanimated, His eating was genuine. For, as Augustine observes (De Civ.

For to that man's innermost \nperceptions He is, in some sort, ascended unto the Father, who has become \nso far proficient in Him, as to recognize in Him the equal with the \nFather . . . whereas she as yet believed in Him but carnally, since she \nwept for Him as for a man.\" But when one reads elsewhere of Mary having \ntouched Him, when with the other women, she \"'came up and took hold of \nHis feet,' that matters little,\" as Severianus says [*Chrysologus, Serm. \nlxxvi], \"for, the first act relates to figure, the other to sex; the \nformer is of Divine grace, the latter of human nature.\" Or as Chrysostom \nsays (Hom. lxxxvi in Joan.): \"This woman wanted to converse with Christ \njust as before the Passion, and out of joy was thinking of nothing great, \nalthough Christ's flesh had become much nobler by rising again.\" And \ntherefore He said: \"I have not yet ascended to My Father\"; as if to say: \n\"Do not suppose I am leading an earthly life; for if you see Me upon \nearth, it is because I have not yet ascended to My Father, but I am going \nto ascend shortly.\" Hence He goes on to say: \"I ascend to My Father, and \nto your Father.\"",

For if before He died for us and rose again \nthe disciples could not look upon Him when He was transfigured upon the \nmountain, how much less were they able to gaze upon Him when our Lord's \nflesh was glorified.\" It must also be borne in mind that after His \nResurrection our Lord wished especially to show that He was the same as \nhad died; which the manifestation of His brightness would have hindered \nconsiderably: because change of features shows more than anything else \nthe difference in the person seen: and this is because sight specially \njudges of the common sensibles, among which is one and many, or the same \nand different. But before the Passion, lest His disciples might despise \nits weakness, Christ meant to show them the glory of His majesty; and \nthis the brightness of the body specially indicates.

Fourthly, our reverence for Him \nis thereby increased, since we no longer deem Him an earthly man, but the \nGod of heaven; thus the Apostle says (2 Cor. 5:16): \"If we have known \nChrist according to the flesh---'that is, as mortal, whereby we reputed \nHim as a mere man,'\" as the gloss interprets the words---\"but now we know \nHim so no longer.\"\nOn His part, in regard to those things which, in ascending, He did for \nour salvation.

Now it was said before (Question [8], Articles [1],4) that Christ even in His \nhuman nature is Head of the entire Church, and that God has \"put all \nthings under His feet.\" Consequently, it belongs to Him, even according \nto His human nature, to exercise judiciary power. on this account. it \nseems that the authority of Scripture quoted above must be interpreted \nthus: \"He gave Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of Man\"; \nnot on account of the condition of His nature, for thus all men would \nhave this kind of power, as Chrysostom objects (Hom. xxxix in Joan.); but \nbecause this belongs to the grace of the Head, which Christ received in \nHis human nature.\nNow judiciary power belongs to Christ in this way according to His human \nnature on three accounts. First, because of His likeness and kinship with \nmen; for, as God works through intermediary causes, as being closer to \nthe effects, so He judges men through the Man Christ, that His judgment \nmay be sweeter to men. Hence (Heb. 4:15) the Apostle says: \"For we have \nnot a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities; but one \ntempted in all  things like as we are, without sin. Let us go therefore \nwith confidence to the throne of His grace.\" Secondly, because at the \nlast judgment, as Augustine says (Tract. xix in Joan.), \"there will be a \nresurrection of dead bodies, which God will raise up through the Son of \nMan\"; just as by \"the same Christ He raises souls,\" inasmuch as \"He is \nthe Son of God.\" Thirdly, because, as Augustine observes (De Verb. Dom., \nSerm. cxxvii): \"It was but right that those who were to be judged should \nsee their judge. But those to be judged were the good and the bad. It \nfollows that the form of a servant should be shown in the judgment to \nboth good and wicked, while the form of God should be kept for the good \nalone.\"",
        "RP1": "Judgment belongs to truth as its standard, while it belongs \nto the man imbued with truth, according as he is as it were one with \ntruth, as a kind of law and \"living justice\" [*Aristotle, Ethic. v]. \nHence Augustine quotes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii) the saying of 1 Cor. \n2:15: \"The spiritual man judgeth all things.\" But beyond all creatures \nChrist's soul was more closely united with truth, and more full of truth; \naccording to Jn. 1:14: \"We saw Him . . . full of grace and truth.\" And \naccording to this it belongs principally to the soul of Christ to judge \nall things.",
        "RP2": "It belongs to God alone to bestow beatitude upon souls by a \nparticipation with Himself; but it is Christ's prerogative to bring them \nto such beatitude, inasmuch as He is their Head and the author of their \nsalvation, according to Heb. 2:10: \"Who had brought many children into \nglory, to perfect the author of their salvation by His Passion.\"",
        "RP3": "To know and judge the secrets of hearts, of itself belongs \nto God alone; but from the overflow of the Godhead into Christ's soul it \nbelongs to Him also to know and to judge the secrets of hearts, as we \nstated above (Question [10], Article [2]), when dealing with the knowledge of Christ. \nHence it is written (Rm. 2:16): \"In the day when God shall judge the \nsecrets of men by Jesus Christ.\""

For judiciary power flows from the royal dignity: according \nto Prov. 20:8: \"The king that sitteth on the throne of judgment, \nscattereth away all evil with his look.\" But it was without merits that \nChrist acquired royal power, for it is His due as God's Only-begotten \nSon: thus it is written (Lk. 1:32): \"The Lord God shall give unto Him the \nthrone of David His father, and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for \never.\" Therefore Christ did not obtain judiciary power by His merits.",
        "OB2": "Further, as stated above (Article [2]), judiciary power is Christ's due \ninasmuch as He is our Head.

Consequently, it seems that Christ did not have judiciary power \nfrom merits.",

Augustine, Tract. civ in Joan.]. And in the same way it must be \nsaid that judiciary power belongs to the Man Christ on account of both \nHis Divine personality, and the dignity of His headship, and the fulness \nof His habitual grace: and yet He obtained it from merit, so that, in \naccordance with the Divine justice, He should be judge who fought for \nGod's justice, and conquered, and was unjustly condemned. Hence He \nHimself says (Apoc. 3:21): \"I have overcome and am set down in My \nFather's throne [Vulg.: 'with My Father in His throne'].\" Now judiciary \npower is understood by \"throne,\" according to Ps. 9:5: \"Thou hast sat on \nthe throne, who judgest justice.\"",

        "OB2": "Further, no one exercises judgment except over his own subjects. \nBut, according to Heb. 2:8, \"we see not as yet all things subject to\" \nChrist. Therefore it seems that Christ has not judgment over all human \naffairs.",

Dei xx) that it is part of \nDivine judgment for the good to be afflicted sometimes in this world, and \nsometimes to prosper, and in like manner the wicked. But the same was the \ncase also before the Incarnation. Consequently, not all God's judgments \nregarding human affairs are included in Christ's judiciary power.",
        "CON": "It is said (Jn. 5:22): \"The Father hath given all \njudgment to the Son.\"",
        "ANS": "If we speak of Christ according to His Divine Nature, it \nis evident that every judgment of the Father belongs to the Son; for, as \nthe Father does all things through His Word, so He judges all things \nthrough His Word.\nBut if we speak of Christ in His human nature, thus again is it evident \nthat all things are subject to His judgment. This is made clear if we \nconsider first of all the relationship subsisting between Christ's soul \nand the Word of God; for, if \"the spiritual man judgeth all things,\" as \nis said in 1 Cor. 2:15, inasmuch as his soul clings to the Word of God, \nhow much more Christ's soul, which is filled with the truth of the Word \nof God, passes judgment upon all things.\nSecondly, the same appears from the merit of His death; because, \naccording to Rm. 14:9: \"To this end Christ died and rose again; that He \nmight be Lord both of the dead and of the living.\" And therefore He has \njudgment over all men; and on this account the Apostle adds (Rm. 14:10): \n\"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ\": and (Dan. 7:14) \nit is written that \"He gave Him power, and glory, and a kingdom; and all \npeoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him.\"\nThirdly, the same thing is evident from comparison of human affairs with \nthe end of human salvation. For, to whomsoever the substance is \nentrusted, the accessory is likewise committed. Now all human affairs are \nordered for the end of beatitude, which is everlasting salvation, to \nwhich men are admitted, or from which they are excluded by Christ's \njudgment, as is evident from Mt. 25:31,40. Consequently, it is manifest \nthat all human affairs are included in Christ's judiciary power.",

Now Christ, although established king by God, did not wish \nwhile living on earth to govern temporarily an  earthly kingdom; \nconsequently He said (Jn. 18:36): \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" In \nlike fashion He did not wish to exercise judiciary power over temporal \nconcerns, since He came to raise men to Divine things. Hence Ambrose \nobserves on this passage in Luke: \"It is well that He who came down with \na Divine purpose should hold Himself aloof from temporal concerns; nor \ndoes He deign to be a judge of quarrels and an arbiter of property, since \nHe is judge of the quick and the dead, and the arbitrator of merits.\"",

And in the same way perfect \njudgment cannot be passed upon any man before the close of his life, \nsince he can be changed in many respects from good to evil, or \nconversely, or from good to better, or from evil to worse. Hence the \nApostle says (Heb. 9:27): \"It is appointed unto men once to die, and \nafter this the Judgment.\"\nBut it must be observed that although man's temporal life in itself ends \nwith death, still it continues dependent in a measure on what comes after \nit in the future. In one way, as it still lives on in men's memories, in \nwhich sometimes, contrary to the truth, good or evil reputations linger \non. In another way in a man's children, who are so to speak something of \ntheir parent, according to Ecclus. 30:4: \"His father is dead, and he is \nas if he were not dead, for he hath left one behind him that is like \nhimself.\" And yet many good men have wicked sons, and conversely. \nThirdly, as to the result of his actions: just as from the deceit of \nArius and other false leaders unbelief continues to flourish down to the \nclose of the world; and even until then faith will continue to derive its \nprogress from the preaching of the apostles. In a fourth way, as to the \nbody, which is sometimes buried with honor and sometimes left unburied, \nand finally falls to dust utterly. In a fifth way, as to the things upon \nwhich a man's heart is set, such as temporal concerns, for example, some \nof which quickly lapse, while others endure longer.\nNow all these things are submitted to the verdict of the Divine \nJudgment; and consequently, a perfect and public Judgment cannot be made \nof all these things during the course of this present time. Wherefore, \nthere must be a final Judgment at the last day, in which everything \nconcerning every man in every respect shall be perfectly and publicly \njudged.",
        "RP1": "Some men have held the opinion that the souls of the saints \nshall not be rewarded in heaven, nor the souls of the lost punished in \nhell, until the Judgment-day.

But this is to see God in His Essence, wherein \nconsists \"eternal life,\" as is clear from Jn. 17:3. Hence it is manifest \nthat the souls separated from bodies are in eternal life.\nConsequently, it must be maintained that after death man enters into an \nunchangeable state as to all that concerns the soul: and therefore there \nis no need for postponing judgment as to the reward of the soul. But \nsince there are some other things  pertaining to a man which go on \nthrough the whole course of time, and which are not foreign to the Divine \njudgment, all these things must be brought to judgment at the end of \ntime.

First of all, from the closeness of His assumed nature to \nGod; because, according to Heb. 2:16: \"For  nowhere doth He take hold of \nthe angels, but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold.\" Consequently, \nChrist's soul is more filled with the truth of the Word of God than any \nangel: for which reason He also enlightens the angels, as Dionysius says \n(Coel. Hier. vii), and so He has power to judge them. Secondly, because \nby the lowliness of His Passion, human nature in Christ merited to be \nexalted above the angels; so that, as is said in Phil. 2:10: \"In the name \nof Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, \nand under the earth.\" And therefore Christ has judiciary power even over \nthe good and wicked angels: in token whereof it is said in the Apocalypse \n(7:11) that \"all the angels stood round about the throne.\" Thirdly, on \naccount of what they do for men, of whom Christ is the Head in a special \nmanner. Hence it is written (Heb. 1:14): \"They are [Vulg.: 'Are they \nnot'] all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall \nreceive the inheritance of salvation (?).\" But they are submitted to \nChrist's judgment, first, as regards the dispensing of those things which \nare done through them; which dispensing is likewise done by the Man \nChrist, to whom the angels ministered, as related (Mt. 4:11), and from \nwhom the devils besought that they might be sent into the swine, \naccording to Mt. 8:31. Secondly, as to other accidental rewards of the \ngood angels, such as the joy which they have at the salvation of men, \naccording to Lk. 15:10: \"There shall be joy before the angels of God upon \none sinner doing penance\": and furthermore as to the accidental \npunishments of the devils wherewith they are either tormented here, or \nare shut up in hell; and this also belongs to the Man Christ: hence it is \nwritten (Mk. 1:24) that the devil cried out: \"What have we to do with \nthee, Jesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us?\" Thirdly, as to the \nessential reward of the good angels, which is everlasting bliss; and as \nto the essential punishment of the wicked angels, which is everlasting \ndamnation. But this was done by Christ from the beginning of the world, \ninasmuch as He is the Word of God.",
        "RP1": "This argument considers judgment as to the essential reward \nand chief punishment.",
        "RP2": "As Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): \"Although the \nspiritual man judgeth all things, still he is judged by Truth Itself.\" \nConsequently, although the angels judge, as being spiritual creatures, \nstill they are judged by Christ, inasmuch as He is the Truth.",
        "RP3": "Christ judges not only the angels, but also the \nadministration of all creatures. For if, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii) \nthe lower things are ruled by God through the higher, in a certain order, \nit must be said that all things are ruled by Christ's soul, which is \nabove every creature. Hence the Apostle says (Heb. 2:5): \"For God hath \nnot subjected unto angels the world to come\"---subject namely to \nChrist---\"of whom we speak\" [Douay: 'whereof we speak'] [*The words \n\"subject namely to Christ\" are from a gloss].

        "ANS": "The sacraments, as stated above (Articles [2],3), are employed \nas signs for man's sanctification. Consequently they can be considered in \nthree ways: and in each way it is fitting for words to be added to the \nsensible signs. For in the first place they can be considered in regard \nto the cause of sanctification, which is the Word incarnate: to Whom the \nsacraments have a certain conformity, in that the word is joined to the \nsensible sign, just as in the mystery of the Incarnation the Word of God \nis united to sensible flesh.\nSecondly, sacraments may be considered on the part of man who is \nsanctified, and who is composed of soul and body: to whom the sacramental \nremedy is adjusted, since it touches the body through the sensible \nelement, and the soul through faith in the words. Hence Augustine says \n(Tract. lxxx in Joan.) on Jn. 15:3, \"Now you are clean by reason of the \nword,\" etc.: \"Whence hath water this so great virtue, to touch the body \nand wash the heart, but by the word doing it, not because it is spoken, \nbut because it is believed?\"\nThirdly, a sacrament may be considered on the part of the sacramental \nsignification. Now Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that \"words are \nthe principal signs used by men\"; because words can be formed in various \nways for the purpose of signifying various mental concepts, so that we \nare able to express our thoughts with  greater distinctness by means of \nwords. And therefore in order to insure the perfection of sacramental \nsignification it was necessary to determine the signification of the \nsensible things by means of certain words. For water may signify both a \ncleansing by reason of its humidity, and refreshment by reason of its \nbeing cool: but when we say, \"I baptize thee,\" it is clear that we use \nwater in baptism in order to signify a spiritual cleansing.",

And so, although the sensible sound is changed, \nyet the sense remains the same.\nWhat has been said about the various mispronunciations of words, either \nat the beginning or at the end, holds forasmuch as with us a change at \nthe beginning of a word changes the meaning, whereas a change at the end \ngenerally speaking does not effect such a change: whereas with the Greeks \nthe sense is changed also in the beginning of words in the conjugation of \nverbs.\nNevertheless the principle point to observe is the extent of the \ncorruption entailed by mispronunciation: for in either case it may be so \nlittle that it does not alter the sense of the words; or so great that it \ndestroys it.

Wherefore if he intends by such addition or suppression to perform a \nrite other from that which is recognized by the Church, it seems that the \nsacrament is invalid: because he seems not to intend to do what the \nChurch does.\nThe other point to be considered is the meaning of the words. For since \nin the sacraments, the words produce an effect according to the sense \nwhich they convey, as stated above (Article [7], ad 1), we must see whether the \nchange of words destroys the essential sense of the words: because then \nthe sacrament is clearly rendered invalid. Now it is clear, if any \nsubstantial part of the sacramental form be suppressed, that the \nessential sense of the words is destroyed; and consequently the sacrament \nis invalid. Wherefore Didymus says (De Spir. Sanct. ii): \"If anyone \nattempt to baptize in such a way as to omit one of the aforesaid names,\" \ni.e. of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, \"his baptism will be invalid.\" \nBut if that which is omitted be not a substantial part of the form, such \nan omission does not destroy the essential sense of the words, nor \nconsequently the validity of the sacrament. Thus in the form of the \nEucharist---\"For this is My Body,\" the omission of the word \"for\" does \nnot destroy the essential sense of the words, nor consequently cause the \nsacrament to be invalid; although perhaps he who makes the omission may \nsin from negligence or contempt.\nAgain, it is possible to add something that destroys the essential sense \nof the words: for instance, if one were to say: \"I baptize thee in the \nname of the Father Who is greater, and of the Son Who is less,\" with \nwhich form the Arians baptized: and consequently such an addition makes \nthe sacrament invalid. But if the addition be such as not to destroy the \nessential sense, the sacrament is not rendered invalid. Nor does it \nmatter whether this addition be made at the beginning, in the middle, or \nat the end: For instance, if one were to say, \"I baptize thee in the name \nof the Father Almighty, and of the only Begotten Son, and of the Holy \nGhost, the Paraclete,\" the baptism would be valid; and in like manner if \none were to say, \"I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the \nSon, and of the Holy Ghost\"; and may the Blessed Virgin succour thee, the \nbaptism would be valid.\nPerhaps, however, if one were to say, \"I baptize thee in the  name of \nthe Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and of the Blessed \nVirgin Mary,\" the baptism would be void; because it is written (1 Cor. 1:13): \"Was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of \nPaul?\" But this is true if the intention be to baptize in the name of the \nBlessed Virgin as in the name of the Trinity, by which baptism is \nconsecrated: for such a sense would be contrary to faith, and would \ntherefore render the sacrament invalid: whereas if the addition, \"and in \nthe name of the Blessed Virgin\" be understood, not as if the name of the \nBlessed Virgin effected anything in baptism, but as intimating that her \nintercession may help the person baptized to preserve the baptismal \ngrace, then the sacrament is not rendered void.",

Divine wisdom, \ntherefore, fittingly provides man with means of salvation, in the shape \nof corporeal and sensible signs that are called sacraments.\nThe second reason is taken from the state of man who in sinning \nsubjected himself by his affections to corporeal things. Now the healing \nremedy should be given to a man so as to reach the part affected by \ndisease. Consequently it was fitting that God should provide man with a \nspiritual medicine by means of certain corporeal signs; for if man were \noffered spiritual things without a veil, his mind being taken up with the \nmaterial world would be unable to apply itself to them.\nThe third reason is taken from the fact that man is prone to direct his \nactivity chiefly towards material things. Lest, therefore, it should be \ntoo hard for man to be drawn away entirely from bodily actions, bodily \nexercise was offered to him in the sacraments, by which he might be \ntrained to avoid superstitious practices, consisting in the worship of \ndemons, and all manner of harmful action, consisting in sinful deeds.\nIt follows, therefore, that through the institution of the  sacraments \nman, consistently with his nature, is instructed through sensible things; \nhe is humbled, through confessing that he is subject to corporeal things, \nseeing that he receives assistance through them: and he is even preserved \nfrom bodily hurt, by the healthy exercise of the sacraments.",

        "ANS": "We must needs say that in some way the sacraments of the \nNew Law cause grace. For it is evident that through the sacraments of the \nNew Law man is incorporated with Christ: thus the Apostle says of Baptism \n(Gal. 3:27): \"As many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on \nChrist.\" And man is made a member of Christ through grace alone.\nSome, however, say that they are the cause of grace not by their own \noperation, but in so far as God causes grace in the soul when the \nsacraments are employed. And they give as an example a man who on \npresenting a leaden coin, receives, by the king's command, a hundred \npounds: not as though the leaden coin, by any operation of its own, \ncaused him to be given that sum of money; this being the effect of the \nmere will of the king. Hence Bernard says in a sermon on the Lord's \nSupper: \"Just as a canon is invested by means of a book, an abbot by \nmeans of a crozier, a bishop by means of a ring, so by the various \nsacraments various kinds of grace are conferred.\" But if we examine the \nquestion properly, we shall see that according to the above mode the \nsacraments are mere signs. For the leaden coin is nothing but a sign of \nthe king's command that this man should receive money. In like manner the \nbook is a sign of the conferring of a canonry. Hence, according to this \nopinion the sacraments of the New Law would be mere signs of grace; \nwhereas we have it on the authority of many saints that the sacraments of \nthe New Law not only signify, but also cause grace.\nWe must therefore say otherwise, that an efficient cause is twofold, \nprincipal and instrumental. The principal cause works by the power of its \nform, to which form the effect is likened; just as fire by its own heat \nmakes something hot. In this way none but God can cause grace: since \ngrace is nothing else than a participated likeness of the Divine Nature, \naccording to 2 Pt. 1:4: \"He hath given us most great and precious \npromises; that we may be [Vulg.: 'you may be made'] partakers of the \nDivine Nature.\" But the instrumental cause works not by the power of its \nform, but only by the motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent: \nso that the effect is not likened to the instrument but to the principal \nagent: for instance, the couch is not like the axe, but like the art \nwhich is in the craftsman's mind. And it is thus that the sacraments of \nthe New Law cause grace: for they are instituted by God to be employed \nfor the purpose of conferring grace. Hence Augustine says (Contra Faust. \nxix): \"All these things,\" viz. pertaining to the sacraments, \"are done \nand pass away, but the power,\" viz. of God, \"which works by them, remains \never.\" Now that is, properly speaking, an instrument by which someone \nworks: wherefore it is written (Titus 3:5): \"He saved us by the laver of \nregeneration.\"",
        "RP1": "The principal cause cannot properly be called a sign of its \neffect, even though the latter be hidden and the cause itself sensible \nand manifest. But an instrumental cause, if manifest, can be called a \nsign of a hidden effect, for this reason, that it is not merely a cause \nbut also in a measure an effect in so  far as it is moved by the \nprincipal agent. And in this sense the sacraments of the New Law are both \ncause and signs. Hence, too, is it that, to use the common expression, \n\"they effect what they signify.\" From this it is clear that they \nperfectly fulfil the conditions of a sacrament; being ordained to \nsomething sacred, not only as a sign, but also as a cause.",
        "RP2": "An instrument has a twofold action; one is instrumental, in \nrespect of which it works not by its own power but by the power of the \nprincipal agent: the other is its proper action, which belongs to it in \nrespect of its proper form: thus it belongs to an axe to cut asunder by \nreason of its sharpness, but to make a couch, in so far as it is the \ninstrument of an art. But it does not accomplish the instrumental action \nsave by exercising its proper action: for it is by cutting that it makes \na couch. In like manner the corporeal sacraments by their operation, \nwhich they exercise on the body that they touch, accomplish through the \nDivine institution an instrumental operation on the soul; for example, \nthe water of baptism, in respect of its proper power, cleanses the body, \nand thereby, inasmuch as it is the instrument of the Divine power, \ncleanses the soul: since from soul and body one thing is made.

Now an instrument is twofold. the one, \nseparate, as a stick, for instance; the other, united, as a hand. \nMoreover, the separate instrument is moved by means of the united \ninstrument, as a stick by the hand. Now the principal efficient cause of \ngrace is God Himself, in comparison with Whom Christ's humanity is as a \nunited instrument, whereas the sacrament is as a separate instrument. \nConsequently, the saving power must needs be derived by the sacraments \nfrom Christ's Godhead through His humanity.\nNow sacramental grace seems to be ordained principally to two things: \nnamely, to take away the defects consequent on past sins, in so far as \nthey are transitory in act, but endure in guilt; and, further, to perfect \nthe soul in things pertaining to Divine Worship in regard to the \nChristian Religion. But it is manifest from what has been stated above \n(Question [48], Articles [1],2,6; Question [49], Articles [1],3) that Christ delivered us from our sins \nprincipally through His Passion, not only by way of efficiency and merit, \nbut also by way of satisfaction.

For as it was stated above (Article [5]), the power of Christ's Passion is united to us by faith and the \nsacraments, but in different ways; because the link that comes from faith \nis produced by an act of the soul; whereas the link that comes from the \nsacraments, is produced by making use of exterior things. Now nothing \nhinders that which is subsequent in  point of time, from causing \nmovement, even before it exists in reality, in so far as it pre-exists in \nan act of the soul: thus the end, which is subsequent in point of time, \nmoves the agent in so far as it is apprehended and desired by him. On the \nother hand, what does not yet actually exist, does not cause movement if \nwe consider the use of exterior things. Consequently, the efficient cause \ncannot in point of time come into existence after causing movement, as \ndoes the final cause. It is therefore clear that the sacraments of the \nNew Law do reasonably derive the power of justification from Christ's \nPassion, which is the cause of man's righteousness; whereas the \nsacraments of the Old Law did not.\nNevertheless the Fathers of old were justified by faith in Christ's \nPassion, just as we are. And the sacraments of the old Law were a kind of \nprotestation of that faith, inasmuch as they signified Christ's Passion \nand its effects. It is therefore manifest that the sacraments of the Old \nLaw were not endowed with any power by which they conduced to the \nbestowal of justifying grace: and they merely signified faith by which \nmen were justified.",

But this is impossible; because man is not justified from sin save \nby grace, according to Rm. 3:24: \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"\nWherefore others said that by Circumcision grace is conferred, as to the \nprivative effects of sin, but not as to its positive effects. But this \nalso appears to be false, because by Circumcision, children received the \nfaculty of obtaining glory, which is the ultimate positive effect of \ngrace. Moreover, as regards the order of the formal cause, positive \neffects are naturally prior to privative effects, though according to the \norder of the material cause, the reverse is the case: for a form does not \nexclude privation save by informing the subject.\nHence others say that Circumcision conferred grace also as regards a \ncertain positive effect, i.e. by making man worthy of eternal life, but \nnot so as to repress concupiscence which makes man prone to sin. And so \nat one time it seemed to me. But if the matter be considered carefully, \nthis too appears to be untrue; because the very least grace is sufficient \nto resist any degree of concupiscence, and to merit eternal life.\nAnd therefore it seems better to say that Circumcision was a sign of \njustifying faith: wherefore the Apostle says (Rm. 4:11) that Abraham \n\"received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the justice of faith.\" \nConsequently grace was conferred in Circumcision in so far as it was a \nsign of Christ's future Passion, as will be made clear further on (Question [70], Article [4])."

And in either way it is becoming that there \nshould be seven sacraments.\nFor spiritual life has a certain conformity with the life of the body: \njust as other corporeal things have a certain likeness to things \nspiritual. Now a man attains perfection in the corporeal life in two \nways: first, in regard to his own person; secondly, in regard to the \nwhole community of the society in which he lives, for man is by nature a \nsocial animal. With regard to himself man is perfected in the life of the \nbody, in two ways; first, directly [per se], i.e. by acquiring some vital \nperfection; secondly, indirectly [per accidens], i.e. by the removal of \nhindrances to life, such as ailments, or the like. Now the life of the \nbody is perfected \"directly,\" in three ways. First, by generation whereby \na man begins to be and to live: and corresponding to this in the \nspiritual life there is Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, \naccording to Titus 3:5: \"By the laver of regeneration,\" etc. Secondly, by \ngrowth whereby a man is brought to perfect size and strength: and \ncorresponding to this in the spiritual life there is Confirmation, in \nwhich the Holy Ghost is given to strengthen us. Wherefore the disciples \nwho were already baptized were bidden thus: \"Stay you in the city till \nyou be endued with power from on high\" (Lk. 24:49). Thirdly, by \nnourishment, whereby life and strength are preserved to man; and \ncorresponding to this in the spiritual life there is the Eucharist. \nWherefore it is said (Jn. 6:54): \"Except you eat of the flesh of the Son \nof Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you.\"\nAnd this would be enough for man if he had an impassible life, both \ncorporally and spiritually; but since man is liable at times to both \ncorporal and spiritual infirmity, i.e. sin, hence man needs a cure from \nhis infirmity; which cure is twofold. one is the healing, that restores \nhealth: and corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is Penance, \naccording to Ps. 40:5: \"Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\" \nThe other is the restoration of former vigor by means of suitable diet \nand exercise: and corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is \nExtreme Unction, which removes the remainder of sin, and prepares man for \nfinal glory. Wherefore it is written (James 5:15): \"And if he be in sins \nthey shall be forgiven him.\"\nIn regard to the whole community, man is perfected in two ways. First, \nby receiving power to rule the community and to exercise public acts: and \ncorresponding to this in the spiritual life there is the sacrament of \norder, according to the saying of Heb. 7:27, that priests offer \nsacrifices not for themselves only, but also for the people. Secondly in \nregard to natural propagation. This is accomplished by Matrimony both in \nthe corporal and in the spiritual life: since it is not only a sacrament \nbut also a function of nature.\nWe may likewise gather the number of the sacraments from their being \ninstituted as a remedy against the defect caused by sin. For Baptism is \nintended as a remedy against the absence of spiritual life; Confirmation, \nagainst the infirmity of soul found in those of recent birth; the \nEucharist, against the soul's proneness to sin; Penance, against actual \nsin committed after baptism; Extreme Unction, against the remainders of \nsins---of those sins, namely, which are not sufficiently removed by \nPenance, whether through negligence or through ignorance; order, against \ndivisions in the community; Matrimony, as a remedy against concupiscence \nin the individual, and against the decrease in numbers that results from \ndeath.\nSome, again, gather the number of sacraments from a certain adaptation \nto the virtues and to the defects and penal effects resulting from sin. \nThey say that Baptism corresponds to Faith, and is ordained as a remedy \nagainst original sin; Extreme Unction, to Hope, being ordained against \nvenial sin; the Eucharist, to Charity, being ordained against the penal \neffect which is malice. order, to Prudence, being ordained against \nignorance; Penance to Justice, being ordained against mortal sin; \nMatrimony, to Temperance, being ordained against concupiscence; \nConfirmation, to Fortitude, being ordained against infirmity.",

But cleansing coupled with enlightening, according to \nDionysius, belongs to Baptism; and, for him who falls back into sin, they \nbelong secondarily to Penance and Extreme Unction.

Now that which is essentially such is always of more account than that \nwhich is such by participation.\nSecondly, this is made clear by considering the relation of the \nsacraments to one another. For all the other sacraments seem to be \nordained to this one as to their end. For it is manifest that the \nsacrament of order is ordained to the consecration of the Eucharist: and \nthe sacrament of Baptism to the reception of the Eucharist: while a man \nis perfected by Confirmation, so as not to fear to abstain from this \nsacrament. By Penance and Extreme Unction man is prepared to receive the \nBody of Christ worthily. And Matrimony at least in its signification, \ntouches this sacrament; in so far as it signifies the union of Christ \nwith the Church, of which union the Eucharist is a figure: hence the \nApostle says (Eph. 5:32): \"This is a great sacrament: but I speak in \nChrist and in the Church.\"\nThirdly, this is made clear by considering the rites of the sacraments. \nFor nearly all the sacraments terminate in the Eucharist, as Dionysius \nsays (Eccl.

        "question": "Whether Baptism is the mere washing?",
        "OB1": "It seems that Baptism is not the mere washing. For the washing of \nthe body is something transitory: but Baptism is something permanent. \nTherefore Baptism is not the mere washing; but rather is it \"the \nregeneration, the seal, the safeguarding, the enlightenment,\" as \nDamascene says (De Fide Orth. iv).",
        "OB2": "Further, Hugh of St. Victor says (De Sacram. ii) that \"Baptism is \nwater sanctified by God's word for the blotting out of sins.\" But the \nwashing itself is not water, but a certain use of water.",
        "OB3": "Further, Augustine says (Tract. lxxx super Joan.): \"The word is \nadded to the element, and this becomes a sacrament.\" Now, the element is \nthe water. Therefore Baptism is the water and not the washing.",
        "CON": "It is written (Ecclus. 34:30): \"He that washeth himself \n[baptizatur] after touching the dead, if he touch him again, what does \nhis washing avail?\" It seems, therefore, that Baptism is the washing or \nbathing.",
        "ANS": "In the sacrament of Baptism, three things may be \nconsidered: namely, that which is \"sacrament only\"; that which is \n\"reality and sacrament\"; and that which is \"reality only.\" That which is \nsacrament only, is something visible and outward; the sign, namely, of \nthe inward effect: for such is the very nature of a sacrament. And this \noutward something that can be perceived by the sense is both the water \nitself and its use, which is the washing. Hence some have thought that \nthe water itself is the sacrament: which seems to be the meaning of the \npassage quoted from Hugh of St. Victor. For in the general definition of \na sacrament he says that it is \"a material element\": and in defining \nBaptism he says it is \"water.\"\nBut this is not true. For since the sacraments of the New Law effect a \ncertain sanctification, there the sacrament is completed where the \nsanctification is completed. Now, the sanctification is  not completed in \nwater; but a certain sanctifying instrumental virtue, not permanent but \ntransient, passes from the water, in which it is, into man who is the \nsubject of true sanctification. Consequently the sacrament is not \ncompleted in the very water, but in applying the water to man, i.e. in \nthe washing. Hence the Master (iv, 3) says that \"Baptism is the outward \nwashing of the body done together with the prescribed form of words.\"\nThe Baptismal character is both reality and sacrament: because it is \nsomething real signified by the outward washing; and a sacramental sign \nof the inward justification: and this last is the reality only, in this \nsacrament---namely, the reality signified and not signifying.",
        "RP1": "That which is both sacrament and reality---i.e. the \ncharacter---and that which is reality only---i.e. the inward \njustification---remain: the character remains and is indelible, as stated \nabove (Question [63], Article [5]); the justification remains, but can be lost. \nConsequently Damascene defined Baptism, not as to that which is done \noutwardly, and is the sacrament only; but as to that which is inward. \nHence he sets down two things as pertaining to the character---namely, \n\"seal\" and \"safeguarding\"; inasmuch as the character which is called a \nseal, so far as itself is concerned, safeguards the soul in good. He also \nsets down two things as pertaining to the ultimate reality of the \nsacrament---namely, \"regeneration\" which refers to the fact that man by \nbeing baptized begins the new life of righteousness; and \"enlightenment,\" \nwhich refers especially to faith, by which man receives spiritual life, \naccording to Habac 2 (Heb. 10:38; cf. Habac 2:4): \"But (My) just man \nliveth by faith\"; and Baptism is a sort of protestation of faith; whence \nit is called the \"Sacrament of Faith.\" Likewise Dionysius defined Baptism \nby its relation to the other sacraments, saying (Eccl. Hier. ii) that it \nis \"the principle that forms the habits of the soul for the reception of \nthose most holy words and sacraments\"; and again by its relation to \nheavenly glory, which is the universal end of all the sacraments, when he \nadds, \"preparing the way for us, whereby we mount to the repose of the \nheavenly kingdom\"; and again as to the beginning of spiritual life, when \nhe adds, \"the conferring of our most sacred and Godlike regeneration.\"",

        "RP3": "When the words are added, the element becomes a sacrament, \nnot in the element itself, but in man, to whom the element is applied, by \nbeing used in washing him. Indeed, this is signified by those very words \nwhich are added to the element, when we say: \"I baptize thee,\" etc."

But the obligation of receiving this sacrament was proclaimed \nto mankind after the Passion and Resurrection. First, because Christ's \nPassion put an end to the figurative sacraments, which were supplanted by \nBaptism and the other sacraments of the New Law. Secondly, because by \nBaptism man is \"made conformable\" to Christ's Passion and Resurrection, \nin so far as he dies to sin and begins to live anew unto righteousness. \nConsequently it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise again, before \nproclaiming to man his obligation of conforming himself to Christ's Death \nand Resurrection.",

If these were baptized \nin the name of the Trinity, they must not be rebaptized.\" But if the form \nof the Church be not observed, the sacrament of Baptism is not conferred. \nAnd thus is to be explained what Gregory II [*Gregory III] writes to \nBishop Boniface: \"Those whom you assert to have been baptized by pagans,\" \nnamely, with a form not recognized by the Church, \"we command you to \nrebaptize in the name of the Trinity.\" And the reason of this is that, \njust as on the part of the matter, as far as the essentials of the \nsacrament are concerned, any water will suffice, so, on the part of the \nminister, any man is competent. Consequently, an unbaptized person can \nbaptize in a case of urgency. So that two unbaptized persons may baptize \none another, one baptizing the other and being afterwards baptized by \nhim: and each would receive not only the sacrament but also the reality \nof the sacrament.

For were they to say: \"We baptize thee \nin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,\" some \nmaintain that the sacrament of Baptism would not be conferred, because \nthe form of the Church would not be observed, i.e. \"I baptize thee in the \nname of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\" But this \nreasoning is disproved by the form observed in the Greek Church. For they \nmight say: \"The servant of God, N . . ., is baptized in the name of the \nFather and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,\" under which form the Greeks \nreceive the sacrament of Baptism: and yet this form differs far more from \nthe form that we use, than does this: \"We baptize thee.\"\nThe point to be observed, however, is this, that by this form, \"We \nbaptize thee,\" the intention expressed is that several concur in \nconferring one Baptism: and this seems contrary to the notion of a \nminister; for a man does not baptize save as a minister of Christ, and as \nstanding in His place; wherefore just as there is one Christ, so should \nthere be one minister to represent Christ. Hence the Apostle says \npointedly (Eph. 4:5): \"one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism.\" Consequently, \nan intention which is in opposition to this seems to annul the sacrament \nof Baptism.\nOn the other hand, if each were to say: \"I baptize thee in the name of \nthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,\" each would signify his \nintention as though he were conferring Baptism independently of the \nother. This might occur in the case where both were striving to baptize \nsomeone; and then it is clear that whichever pronounced the words first \nwould confer the sacrament of Baptism; while the other, however great his \nright to baptize, if he presume to utter the words, would be liable to be \npunished as a rebaptizer. If, however, they were to pronounce the words \nabsolutely at the same time, and dipped or sprinkled the man together, \nthey should be punished for baptizing in an improper  manner, but not for \nrebaptizing: because each would intend to baptize an unbaptized person, \nand each, so far as he is concerned, would baptize.

Nor \nwould this cause a change in the Church's form, since the plural is \nnothing but the singular doubled: especially as we find the plural \nexpressed in Mt. 28:19: \"Baptizing them,\" etc. Nor is there parity \nbetween the baptizer and the baptized; since Christ, the baptizer in \nchief, is one: while many are made one in Christ by Baptism.",

First, when \nthose who are to be baptized appear to be perfectly instructed in the \nfaith and ready for Baptism; thus, Philip baptized the Eunuch at once \n(Acts 8); and Peter, Cornelius and those who were with him (Acts 10). \nSecondly, by reason of sickness or some kind of danger of death. \nWherefore Pope Leo says (Epist. xvi): \"Those who are threatened by death, \nsickness, siege, persecution, or shipwreck, should be baptized at any \ntime.\" Yet if a man is forestalled by death, so as to have no time to \nreceive the sacrament, while he awaits the season appointed by the \nChurch, he is saved, yet \"so as by fire,\" as stated above (Article [2], ad 2). \nNevertheless he sins if he defer being baptized beyond the time appointed \nby the Church, except this be for an unavoidable cause and with the \npermission of the authorities of the Church. But even this sin, with his \nother sins, can be washed away by his subsequent contrition, which takes \nthe place of Baptism, as stated above (Question [66], Article [11]).",
        "RP1": "This decree of Pope Leo, concerning the celebration of \nBaptism at two seasons, is to be understood \"with the exception of the \ndanger of death\" (which is always to be feared in children) as stated \nabove.",
        "RP2": "This decree concerning the Jews was for a safeguard to the \nChurch, lest they corrupt the faith of simple  people, if they be not \nfully converted. Nevertheless, as the same passage reads further on, \"if \nwithin the appointed time they are threatened with danger of sickness, \nthey should be baptized.\"",
        "RP3": "Baptism, by the grace which it bestows, removes not only \npast sins, but hinders the commission of future sins. Now this is the \npoint to be considered---that men may not sin: it is a secondary \nconsideration that their sins be less grievous, or that their sins be \nwashed away, according to 1 Jn. 2:1,2: \"My little children, these things \nI write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an \nadvocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just; and He is the \npropitiation for our sins.\""

        "ANS": "A man may be said to be a sinner in two ways. First, on \naccount of the stain and the debt of punishment incurred in the past: and \non sinners in this sense the sacrament of Baptism should be conferred, \nsince it is instituted specially for this purpose, that by it the \nuncleanness of sin may be washed away, according to Eph. 5:26: \"Cleansing \nit by the laver of water in the word of life.\"\nSecondly, a man may be called a sinner because he wills to sin and \npurposes to remain in sin: and on sinners in this sense the sacrament of \nBaptism should not be conferred. First, indeed, because by Baptism men \nare incorporated in Christ, according to Gal. 3:27: \"As many of you as \nhave been baptized in Christ, have  put on Christ.\" Now so long as a man \nwills to sin, he cannot be united to Christ, according to 2 Cor. 6:14: \n\"What participation hath justice with injustice?\" Wherefore Augustine \nsays in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli) that \"no man who has the use of \nfree-will can begin the new life, except he repent of his former life.\" \nSecondly, because there should be nothing useless in the works of Christ \nand of the Church. Now that is useless which does not reach the end to \nwhich it is ordained; and, on the other hand, no one having the will to \nsin can, at the same time, be cleansed from sin, which is the purpose of \nBaptism; for this would be to combine two contradictory things. Thirdly, \nbecause there should be no falsehood in the sacramental signs. Now a sign \nis false if it does not correspond with the thing signified. But the very \nfact that a man presents himself to be cleansed by Baptism, signifies \nthat he prepares himself for the inward cleansing: while this cannot be \nthe case with one who purposes to remain in sin. Therefore it is manifest \nthat on such a man the sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred.",

Neither, therefore, can the sacrament of Baptism give salvation \nto a man whose will is set on sinning, and hence expels the form of \nfaith. Moreover, the impression of the baptismal character cannot dispose \na man for grace as long as he retains the will to sin; for \"God compels \nno man to be virtuous,\" as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii)."

The other is the \noutward confession of sins, which is made to a priest; and such \nconfession is not required before Baptism. First, because this \nconfession, since it is directed to the person of the minister, belongs \nto the sacrament of Penance, which is not required before Baptism, which \nis the door of all the sacraments. Secondly, because the reason why a man \nmakes outward confession to a priest, is that the priest may absolve him \nfrom his sins, and bind him to works of satisfaction, which should not be \nenjoined on the baptized, as stated above (Article [5]). Moreover those who are \nbeing baptized do not need to be released from their sins by the keys of \nthe Church, since all are forgiven them in Baptism.

But \nthis is impossible: both because the child's soul, to the sanctification \nof which Baptism is ordained, is distinct from the soul of the mother; \nand because the body of the animated infant is already formed, and \nconsequently distinct from the body of the mother.

Now, from the very beginning of His conception \nChrist was \"full of grace and truth,\" yet He had a passible body, which \nthrough His Passion and death was raised up to a life of glory.  \nWherefore a Christian receives grace in Baptism, as to his soul; but he \nretains a passible body, so that he may suffer for Christ therein: yet at \nlength he will be raised up to a life of impassibility.

Therefore it is not justified \nby grace and virtues.",

But this is evidently false, \nfor two reasons. First, because children, like adults, are made members \nof Christ in Baptism; hence they must, of necessity, receive an influx of \ngrace and virtues from the Head. Secondly, because, if this were true, \nchildren that die after Baptism, would not come to eternal life; since \naccording to Rm. 6:23, \"the grace of God is life everlasting.\" And \nconsequently Baptism would not have profited them unto salvation.\nNow the source of their error was that they did not recognize the \ndistinction between habit and act. And so, seeing children to be \nincapable of acts of virtue, they thought that they had no virtues at all \nafter Baptism. But this inability of children to act is not due to the \nabsence of habits, but to an impediment on the part of the body: thus \nalso when a man is asleep, though he may have the habits of virtue, yet \nis he hindered from virtuous acts through being asleep.",

Secondly, on account of the tenderness of the infant \nbefore the eighth day.

But this cannot be proved either from the \nauthority of Scripture or from the custom of the Jews. Wherefore it is \nbetter to say with Hugh of St. Victor (De Sacram. i) that the eighth day \nwas never anticipated for any motive, however urgent.

But circumcision was an obligation imposed \nby the Law, according to Gal. 5:3: \"I testify . . . to every man \ncircumcising himself, that ne is a debtor to do the whole law.\" \nTherefore, if justice be by circumcision, \"Christ died in vain,\" i.e. \nwithout cause. But this cannot be allowed. Therefore circumcision did not \nconfer grace whereby the sinner is made righteous.",

Therefore faith alone justified little ones, \nand not circumcision.",

And \nthe same argument avails in regard to those who died before the eighth \nday, which was that of circumcision, which day could nol be anticipated, \nas stated above (Article [3], ad 3).",
        "OB4": "Further, nothing but sin closes the entrance to the heavenly \nkingdom. But before the Passion the entrance to the heavenly kingdom was \nclosed to the circumcised. Therefore men were not justified from sin by \ncircumcision.",
        "OB5": "Further, original sin is not remitted without actual sin being \nremitted also: because \"it is wicked to hope for half forgiveness from \nGod,\" as Augustine says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. ix). But we read \nnowhere of circumcision as remitting actual sin. Therefore neither did it \nremit original sin.\nReply to  When adults were circumcised, they received remission not \nonly of original, but also of actual sin: yet not so as to be delivered \nfrom all debt of punishment, as in Baptism, in which grace is conferred \nmore copiously.",
        "CON": "Augustine says, writing to Valerius in answer to Julian \n(De Nup. et Concup. ii): \"From the time that circumcision was instituted \namong God's people, as 'a seal of the justice of the faith,' it availed \nlittle children unto sanctification by cleansing them from the original \nand bygone sin; just as Baptism also from the time of its institution \nbegan to avail unto the renewal of man.\"",
        "ANS": "All are agreed in saying that original sin was remitted \nin circumcision. But some said that no grace was conferred, and that the \nonly effect was to remit sin. The Master holds this opinion (Sent. iv, D, \n1), and in a gloss on Rm. 4:11. But this is impossible, since guilt is \nnot remitted except by grace, according to Rm. 3:2: \"Being justified \nfreely by His grace,\" etc.\nWherefore others said that grace was bestowed by circumcision, as to \nthat effect which is the remission of guilt, but not as to  its positive \neffects; lest they should be compelled to say that the grace bestowed in \ncircumcision sufficed for the fulfilling of the precepts of the Law, and \nthat, consequently, the coming of Christ was unnecessary. But neither can \nthis opinion stand. First, because by circumcision children. received the \npower of obtaining glory at the allotted time, which is the last positive \neffect of grace. Secondly, because, in the order of the formal cause, \npositive effects naturally precede those that denote privation, although \nit is the reverse in the order of the material cause: since a form does \nnot remove a privation save by informing the subject.\nConsequently, others said that grace was conferred in circumcision, also \nas a particular positive effect consisting in being made worthy of \neternal life; but not as to all its effects, for it did not suffice for \nthe repression of the concupiscence of the fomes, nor again for the \nfulfilment of the precepts of the Law. And this was my opinion at one \ntime (Sent. iv, D, 1; Question [2], Article [4]). But if one consider the matter \ncarefully, it is clear that this is not true. Because the least grace can \nresist any degree of concupiscence, and avoid every mortal sin, that is \ncommitted in transgressing the precepts of the Law; for the smallest \ndegree of charity loves God more than cupidity loves \"thousands of gold \nand silver\" (Ps. 118:72).\nWe must say, therefore, that grace was bestowed in circumcision as to \nall the effects of grace, but not as in Baptism. Because in Baptism grace \nis bestowed by the very power of Baptism itself, which power Baptism has \nas the instrument of Christ's Passion already consummated. Whereas \ncircumcision bestowed grace, inasmuch as it was a sign of faith in \nChrist's future Passion: so that the man who was circumcised, professed \nto embrace that faith; whether, being an adult, he made profession for \nhimself, or, being a child, someone else made profession for him. Hence, \ntoo, the Apostle says (Rm. 4:11), that Abraham \"received the sign of \ncircumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith\": because, to wit, \njustice was of faith signified: not of circumcision signifying. And since \nBaptism operates instrumentally by the power of Christ's Passion, whereas \ncircumcision does not, therefore Baptism imprints a character that \nincorporates man in Christ, and bestows grace more copiously than does \ncircumcision; since greater is the effect of a thing already present, \nthan of the hope thereof.",

But before, there was no need of a sign expressive of this \nfaith; because as yet believers had not begun to be united together apart \nfrom unbelievers for the worship of one God. It is probable, however, \nthat parents who were believers offered up some prayers to God for their \nchildren, especially if these were in any danger. Or bestowed some \nblessing on them, as a \"seal of faith\"; just as the adults offered \nprayers and sacrifices  for themselves.",

But this \ncannot be admitted; since the institution of a new sacrament belongs to \nthe power of excellence, which belongs to Christ alone.\nAnd therefore we must say that Christ instituted this sacrament not by \nbestowing, but by promising it, according to Jn. 16:7: \"If I go not, the \nParaclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you.\" And \nthis was because in this sacrament the fulness of the Holy Ghost is \nbestowed, which was not to be given before Christ's Resurrection and \nAscension; according to Jn.  7:39: \"As yet the Spirit was not given, \nbecause Jesus was not yet glorified.\"",

Hence (Lk. 4:1) \nit is written that \"Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the \nJordan.\" Nor was it fitting to Christ's dignity, that He, Who is the \nAuthor of the sacraments, should receive the fulness of grace from a \nsacrament."

Moreover, the \napostles themselves bestowed this sacrament without chrism, by the mere \nimposition of hands: for it is written (Acts 8:17) that the apostles \n\"laid their hands upon\" those who were baptized, \"and they received the \nHoly Ghost.\" Therefore chrism is not the matter of this sacrament: since \nthe matter is essential to the sacrament.",

For, as \nstated above (Article [1]), in this sacrament the fulness of the Holy Ghost is \ngiven for the spiritual strength which belongs to the perfect age. Now \nwhen man comes to perfect age he begins at once to have intercourse with \nothers; whereas until then he lives an individual life, as it were, \nconfined to himself. Now the grace of the Holy Ghost is signified by oil; \nhence Christ is said to be \"anointed with the oil of gladness\" (Ps. 44:8), by reason of His being gifted with the fulness of the Holy Ghost. \nConsequently oil is a suitable matter of this sacrament. And balm is \nmixed with the oil, by reason of its fragrant odor, which spreads about: \nhence the Apostle says (2 Cor. 2:15): \"We are the good odor of Christ,\" \netc. And though many other things be fragrant, yet preference is given to \nbalm, because it has a special odor of its own, and because it confers \nincorruptibility: hence it is written (Ecclus. 24:21): \"My odor is as the \npurest balm.\"",

Nevertheless, \nsomething of keeping with the matter of this sacrament was displayed to \nthe apostles in a sensible manner when they received the Holy Ghost. For \nthat the Holy Ghost came down upon them in a sensible manner under the \nform of fire, refers to the same signification as oil: except in so far \nas fire has an active power, while oil has a passive power, as being the \nmatter and incentive of fire. And this was quite fitting: for it was \nthrough the apostles that the grace of the Holy Ghost was to flow forth \nto others. Again, the Holy Ghost came down on the apostles in the shape \nof a tongue. Which refers to the same signification as balm: except in so \nfar as the tongue communicates with others by speech, but balm, by its \nodor. because, to wit, the apostles were filled with the Holy Ghost, as \nteachers of the Faith; but the rest of the believers, as doing that which \ngives edification to the faithful.\nIn like manner, too, when the apostles imposed their hands, and when \nthey preached, the fulness of the Holy Ghost came down under visible \nsigns on the faithful, just as, at the beginning, He came down on the \napostles: hence Peter said (Acts 11:15): \"When I had begun to speak, the \nHoly Ghost fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning.\" \nConsequently there was no need for sacramental sensible matter, where God \nsent sensible signs miraculously.\nHowever, the apostles commonly made use of chrism in bestowing the \nsacrament, when such like visible signs were lacking.

And whatever other liquid is so called, derives \nits name from its likeness to this oil: nor are the latter commonly used, \nunless it be to supply the want of olive oil.

First \nof all, because of what is contained in the sacrament: for Christ is \nHimself contained in the Eucharist sacramentally. Consequently, when \nChrist was going to leave His disciples in His proper species, He left \nHimself with them under the sacramental species; as the Emperor's image \nis set up to be reverenced in his absence. Hence Eusebius says: \"Since He \nwas going to withdraw His assumed body from their eyes, and bear it away \nto the stars, it was needful that on the day of the supper He should \nconsecrate the sacrament of His body and blood for our sakes, in order \nthat what was once offered up for our ransom should be fittingly \nworshiped in a mystery.\"\nSecondly, because without faith in the Passion there could never be any \nsalvation, according to Rm. 3:25: \"Whom God hath proposed to be a \npropitiation, through faith in His blood.\" It was necessary accordingly \nthat there should be at all times among men something to show forth our \nLord's Passion; the chief sacrament of which in the old Law was the \nPaschal Lamb. Hence the Apostle says (1 Cor. 5:7): \"Christ our Pasch is \nsacrificed.\" But its successor under the New Testament is the sacrament \nof the Eucharist, which is a remembrance of the Passion now past, just as \nthe other was figurative of the Passion to come. And so it was fitting \nthat when the hour of the Passion was come, Christ should institute a new \nSacrament after celebrating the old, as Pope Leo I says (Serm. lviii).\nThirdly, because last words, chiefly such as are spoken by departing \nfriends, are committed most deeply to memory; since then especially \naffection for friends is more enkindled, and the things which affect us \nmost are impressed the deepest in the soul. Consequently, since, as Pope \nAlexander I says, \"among sacrifices there can be none greater than the \nbody and blood of Christ, nor any more powerful oblation\"; our Lord \ninstituted this sacrament at His last parting with His disciples, in \norder that it might be held in the greater veneration. And this is what \nAugustine says (Respons. ad Januar. i): \"In order to commend more \nearnestly the death of this mystery, our Saviour willed this last act to \nbe fixed in the hearts and memories of the disciples whom He was about to \nquit for the Passion.\"",

Secondly, because bread is properly the sacrament \nof Christ's body, which was conceived without corruption, rather than of \nHis Godhead, as will be seen later (Question [76], Article [1], ad 1). Thirdly, because \nthis is more in keeping with the sincerity of the faithful, which is \nrequired in the use of this sacrament, according to 1 Cor. 5:7: \"Christ \nour Pasch is sacrificed: therefore let us feast . . . with the unleavened \nbread of sincerity and truth.\"\nHowever, this custom of the Greeks is not unreasonable both on account \nof its signification, to which Gregory refers, and in detestation of the \nheresy of the Nazarenes, who mixed up legal observances with the Gospel.",
        "RP1": "As we read in Ex. 12, the paschal solemnity began on the \nevening of the fourteenth day of the moon. So, then, after immolating the \nPaschal Lamb, Christ instituted this sacrament: hence this day is said by \nJohn to precede the day of the Pasch, while the other three Evangelists \ncall it \"the first day of the Azymes,\" when fermented bread was not found \nin the houses of the Jews, as stated above. Fuller mention was made of \nthis in the treatise on our Lord's Passion (Question [46], Article [9], ad 1).",
        "RP2": "Those who celebrate the sacrament with unleavened bread do \nnot intend to follow the ceremonial of the Law, but to conform to \nChrist's institution; so they are not Judaizing; otherwise those \ncelebrating in fermented bread would be Judaizing, because the Jews \noffered up fermented bread for the first-fruits.",
        "RP3": "Leaven denotes charity on account of one single effect, \nbecause it makes the bread more savory and larger; but it also signifies \ncorruption from its very nature.",
        "RP4": "Since whatever is fermented partakes of corruption, this \nsacrament may not be made from corrupt bread, as stated above (Article [3], ad 4); consequently, there is a wider difference between unleavened and \nleavened bread than between warm and cold baptismal water: because there \nmight be such corruption of  fermented bread that it could not be validly \nused for the sacrament."

For, the \nsacrifices of the Old Law contained only in figure that true sacrifice of \nChrist's Passion, according to Heb. 10:1: \"For the law having a shadow of \nthe good things to come, not the very image of the things.\" And therefore \nit was necessary that the sacrifice of the New Law instituted by Christ \nshould have something more, namely, that it should contain Christ Himself \ncrucified, not merely in signification or figure, but also in very truth. \nAnd therefore this sacrament which contains Christ Himself, as Dionysius \nsays (Eccl.

For dissolution cannot be made into primary matter, so \nthat a subject can exist without a form, since matter cannot exist \nwithout a form. But since after the consecration nothing remains under \nthe sacramental species except the body and the blood of Christ, it will \nbe necessary to say that the elements into which the substance of the \nbread and wine is dissolved, depart from thence by local motion, which \nwould be perceived by the senses. In like manner also the substance of \nthe bread or wine remains until the last instant of the consecration; but \nin the last instant of the consecration there is already present there \nthe substance of the body or blood of Christ, just as the form is already \npresent in the last instant of generation. Hence no instant can be \nassigned in which the original matter can be there. For it cannot be said \nthat the substance of the bread or wine is dissolved gradually into the \noriginal matter, or that it successively quits the species, for if this \nbegan to be done in the last instant of its consecration, then at the one \ntime under part of the host there would be the body of Christ together \nwith the substance of bread, which is contrary to what has been said \nabove (Article [2]). But if this begin to come to pass before the consecration, \nthere will then be a time in which under one part of the host there will \nbe neither the substance of bread nor the body of Christ, which is not \nfitting. They seem indeed to have taken this into careful consideration, \nwherefore they formulated their proposition  with an alternative viz. \nthat (the substance) may be annihilated.

Thirdly on the part of the agent, which possesses \ninfinite power: wherefore it can instantly dispose the matter for the \nform.

Hence between the instant that marks the close of rest, \nand another which marks the beginning of movement, there is no mid-time. \nBut in this they are mistaken, because the unity of time and of instant, \nor even their plurality, is not taken according to movements of any sort, \nbut according to the first movement of the heavens, which is the measure \nof all movement and rest.\nAccordingly others grant this of the time which measures movement \ndepending on the movement of the heavens. But there are some movements \nwhich are not dependent on the movement of the heavens, nor measured by \nit, as was said in the FP, Question [53], Article [3] concerning the movements of the \nangels. Hence between two instants responding to those movements there is \nno mid-time. But this is not to the point, because although the change in \nquestion has no relation of itself to the movement of the heavens, still \nit follows the pronouncing of the words, which (pronouncing) must \nnecessarily be measured by the movement of the heavens. And therefore \nthere must of necessity be a mid-time between every two signate instants \nin connection with that change.\nSome say therefore that the instant in which the bread was last, and the \ninstant in which the body of Christ is first, are indeed two in \ncomparison with the things measured, but are one comparatively to the \ntime measuring; as when two lines touch, there are two points on the part \nof the two lines, but one point on the part of the place containing them. \nBut here there is no likeness, because instant and time is not the \nintrinsic measure of particular movements, as a line and point are of a \nbody, but only the extrinsic measure, as place is to bodies.\nHence others say that it is the same instant in fact, but another \naccording to reason. But according to this it would follow that things \nreally opposite would exist together; for diversity of  reason does not \nchange a thing objectively.\nAnd therefore it must be said that this change, as stated above, is \nwrought by Christ's words which are spoken by the priest, so that the \nlast instant of pronouncing the words is the first instant in which \nChrist's body is in the sacrament; and that the substance of the bread is \nthere during the whole preceding time. Of this time no instant is to be \ntaken as proximately preceding the last one, because time is not made up \nof successive instants, as is proved in Phys. vi.

        "ANS": "This conversion of bread into the body of Christ has \nsomething in common with creation, and with natural transmutation, and in \nsome respect differs from both. For the order of the terms is common to \nthese three; that is, that after one thing there is another (for, in \ncreation there is being after non-being; in this sacrament, Christ's body \nafter the substance of bread; in natural transmutation white after black, \nor fire after air); and that the aforesaid terms are not coexistent.\nNow the conversion, of which we are speaking, has this in common with \ncreation, that in neither of them is there any common subject belonging \nto either of the extremes; the contrary of which appears in every natural \ntransmutation.\nAgain, this conversion has something in common with natural \ntransmutation in two respects, although not in the same fashion. First of \nall because in both, one of the extremes passes into the other, as bread \ninto Christ's body, and air into fire; whereas non-being is not converted \ninto being. But this comes to pass differently on the one side and on the \nother; for in this sacrament the whole substance of the bread passes into \nthe whole body of Christ; whereas in natural transmutation the matter of \nthe one receives the form of the other, the previous form being laid \naside. Secondly, they have this in common, that on both sides something \nremains the same; whereas this does not happen in creation: yet \ndifferently; for the same matter or subject remains in natural \ntransmutation; whereas in this sacrament the same accidents remain.\nFrom these observations we can gather the various ways of speaking in \nsuch matters. For, because in no one of the aforesaid three things are \nthe extremes coexistent, therefore in none of them can one extreme be \npredicated of the other by the substantive verb of the present tense: for \nwe do not say, \"Non-being is being\" or, \"Bread is the body of Christ,\" \nor, \"Air is fire,\" or, \"White is black.\" Yet because of the relationship \nof the extremes in all of them we can use the preposition \"ex\" [out of], \nwhich denotes order; for we can truly and properly say that \"being is \nmade out of non-being,\" and \"out of bread, the body of Christ,\" and \"out \nof air, fire,\" and \"out of white, black.\" But because in creation one of \nthe extremes does not pass into the other, we cannot use the  word \n\"conversion\" in creation, so as to say that \"non-being is converted into \nbeing\": we can, however, use the word in this sacrament, just as in \nnatural transmutation. But since in this sacrament the whole substance is \nconverted into the whole substance, on that account this conversion is \nproperly termed transubstantiation.\nAgain, since there is no subject of this conversion, the things which \nare true in natural conversion by reason of the subject, are not to be \ngranted in this conversion. And in the first place indeed it is evident \nthat potentiality to the opposite follows a subject, by reason whereof we \nsay that \"a white thing can be black,\" or that \"air can be fire\"; \nalthough the latter is not so proper as the former: for the subject of \nwhiteness, in which there is potentiality to blackness, is the whole \nsubstance of the white thing; since whiteness is not a part thereof; \nwhereas the subject of the form of air is part thereof: hence when it is \nsaid, \"Air can be fire,\" it is verified by synecdoche by reason of the \npart. But in this conversion, and similarly in creation, because there is \nno subject, it is not said that one extreme can be the other, as that \n\"non-being can be being,\" or that \"bread can be the body of Christ\": and \nfor the same reason it cannot be properly said that \"being is made of \n[de] non-being,\" or that \"the body of Christ is made of bread,\" because \nthis preposition \"of\" [de] denotes a consubstantial cause, which \nconsubstantiality of the extremes in natural transmutations is considered \naccording to something common in the subject. And for the same reason it \nis not granted that \"bread will be the body of Christ,\" or that it \"may \nbecome the body of Christ,\" just as it is not granted in creation that \n\"non-being will be being,\" or that \"non-being may become being,\" because \nthis manner of speaking is verified in natural transmutations by reason \nof the subject: for instance, when we say that \"a white thing becomes \nblack,\" or \"a white thing will be black.\"\nNevertheless, since in this sacrament, after the change, something \nremains the same, namely, the accidents of the bread, as stated above \n(Article [5]), some of these expressions may be admitted by way of similitude, \nnamely, that \"bread is the body of Christ,\" or, \"bread will be the body \nof Christ,\" or \"the body of Christ is made of bread\"; provided that by \nthe word \"bread\" is not understood the substance of bread, but in general \n\"that which is contained under the species of bread,\" under which species \nthere is first contained the substance of bread, and afterwards the body \nof Christ.",

But in this conversion \nnot only is it difficult for this whole to be changed into that whole, so \nthat nothing of the former may remain (which does not belong to the \ncommon mode of production of a cause), but furthermore it has this \ndifficulty that the accidents remain while the substance is destroyed, \nand many other difficulties of which we shall treat hereafter (Question [77]). \nNevertheless the word \"conversion\" is admitted in this sacrament, but not \nin creation, as stated above.",

But \nChrist's body as it is in this sacrament cannot be  seen by any bodily \neye. First of all, because a body which is visible brings about an \nalteration in the medium, through its accidents. Now the accidents of \nChrist's body are in this sacrament by means of the substance; so that \nthe accidents of Christ's body have no immediate relationship either to \nthis sacrament or to adjacent bodies; consequently they do not act on the \nmedium so as to be seen by any corporeal eye. Secondly, because, as \nstated above (Article [1], ad 3; Article [3]), Christ's body is substantially present \nin this sacrament. But substance, as such, is not visible to the bodily \neye, nor does it come under any one of the senses, nor under the \nimagination, but solely under the intellect, whose object is \"what a \nthing is\" (De Anima iii). And therefore, properly speaking, Christ's \nbody, according to the mode of being which it has in this sacrament, is \nperceptible neither by the sense nor by the imagination, but only by the \nintellect, which is called the spiritual eye.\nMoreover it is perceived differently by different intellects. For since \nthe way in which Christ is in this sacrament is entirely supernatural, it \nis visible in itself to a supernatural, i.e. the Divine, intellect, and \nconsequently to a beatified intellect, of angel or of man, which, through \nthe participated glory of the Divine intellect, sees all supernatural \nthings in the vision of the Divine Essence. But it can be seen by a \nwayfarer through faith alone, like other supernatural things. And not \neven the angelic intellect of its own natural power is capable of \nbeholding it; consequently the devils cannot by their intellect perceive \nChrist in this sacrament, except through faith, to which they do not pay \nwilling assent; yet they are convinced of it from the evidence of signs, \naccording to James 2:19: \"The devils believe, and tremble.\"",

        "ANS": "Such apparition comes about in two ways, when \noccasionally in this sacrament flesh, or blood, or a child, is seen. \nSometimes it happens on the part of the beholders, whose eyes are so \naffected as if they outwardly saw flesh, or blood, or a child, while no \nchange takes place in the sacrament. And this seems to happen when to one \nperson it is seen under the species of flesh or of a child, while to \nothers it is seen as before under the species of bread; or when to the \nsame individual it appears for an hour under the appearance of flesh or a \nchild, and afterwards under the appearance of bread. Nor is there any \ndeception there, as occurs in the feats of magicians, because such \nspecies is divinely formed in the eye in order to represent some truth, \nnamely, for the purpose of showing that Christ's body is truly under this \nsacrament; just as Christ without deception appeared to the disciples who \nwere going to Emmaus. For Augustine says (De Qq. Evang. ii) that \"when \nour pretense is referred to some significance, it is not a lie, but a \nfigure of the truth.\" And since in this way no change is made in the \nsacrament, it is manifest that, when such apparition occurs, Christ does \nnot cease to be under this sacrament.\nBut it sometimes happens that such apparition comes about not merely by \na change wrought in the beholders, but by an appearance which really \nexists outwardly. And this indeed is seen to happen  when it is beheld by \neveryone under such an appearance, and it remains so not for an hour, but \nfor a considerable time; and, in this case some think that it is the \nproper species of Christ's body. Nor does it matter that sometimes \nChrist's entire body is not seen there, but part of His flesh, or else \nthat it is not seen in youthful guise. but in the semblance of a child, \nbecause it lies within the power of a glorified body for it to be seen by \na non-glorified eye either entirely or in part, and under its own \nsemblance or in strange guise, as will be said later (XP, Question [85], Articles [2],3).\nBut this seems unlikely. First of all, because Christ's body under its \nproper species can be seen only in one place, wherein it is definitively \ncontained. Hence since it is seen in its proper species, and is adored in \nheaven, it is not seen under its proper species in this sacrament. \nSecondly, because a glorified body, which appears at will, disappears \nwhen it wills after the apparition; thus it is related (Lk. 24:31) that \nour Lord \"vanished out of sight\" of the disciples. But that which appears \nunder the likeness of flesh in this sacrament, continues for a long time; \nindeed, one reads of its being sometimes enclosed, and, by order of many \nbishops, preserved in a pyx, which it would be wicked to think of Christ \nunder His proper semblance.\nConsequently, it remains to be said, that, while the dimensions remain \nthe same as before, there is a miraculous change wrought in the other \naccidents, such as shape, color, and the rest, so that flesh, or blood, \nor a child, is seen. And, as was said already, this is not deception, \nbecause it is done \"to represent the truth,\" namely, to show by this \nmiraculous apparition that Christ's body and blood are truly in this \nsacrament. And thus it is clear that as the dimensions remain, which are \nthe foundation of the other accidents, as we shall see later on (Question [77], Article [2]), the body of Christ truly remains in this sacrament.",

Furthermore it is \nmanifest that these accidents are not subjected in the substance of \nChrist's body and blood, because the substance of the human body cannot \nin any way be affected by such accidents; nor is it possible for Christ's \nglorious and impassible body to be altered so as to receive these \nqualities.\nNow there are some who say that they are in the surrounding atmosphere \nas in a subject. But even this cannot be: in the first place, because \natmosphere is not susceptive of such accidents. Secondly, because these \naccidents are not where the atmosphere is, nay more, the atmosphere is \ndisplaced by the motion of these species. Thirdly, because accidents do \nnot pass from subject to subject, so that the same identical accident \nwhich was first in one subject be afterwards in another; because an \naccident is individuated by the subject; hence it cannot come to pass for \nan accident remaining identically the same to be at one time in one \nsubject, and at another time in another.

This can be done by Divine power: for since an effect \ndepends more upon the first cause than on the second, God Who is the \nfirst cause both of substance and accident, can by His unlimited power \npreserve an accident in existence when the substance is withdrawn whereby \nit was preserved in existence as by its proper cause, just as without \nnatural causes He can produce other effects of natural causes, even as He \nformed a human body in the Virgin's womb, \"without the seed of man\" (Hymn \nfor Christmas, First Vespers).",

Secondly, because the first \ndisposition of matter is dimensive quantity, hence Plato also assigned \n\"great\" and \"small\" as the first differences of matter (Aristotle, \nMetaph. iv). And because the first subject is matter, the consequence is \nthat all other accidents are related to their subject through the medium \nof dimensive quantity; just as the first subject of color is said to be \nthe surface, on which account some have maintained that dimensions are \nthe substances of bodies, as is said in Metaph. iii. And since, when the \nsubject is withdrawn, the accidents remain according to the being which \nthey had before, it follows that all accidents remain founded upon \ndimensive quantity.\nThirdly, because, since the subject is the principle of individuation of \nthe accidents, it is necessary for what is admitted as the subject of \nsome accidents to be somehow the principle of individuation: for it is of \nthe very notion of an individual that it cannot be in several; and this \nhappens in two ways. First, because it is not natural to it to be in any \none; and in this way immaterial separated forms, subsisting of \nthemselves, are also individuals of themselves. Secondly, because a form, \nbe it substantial or accidental, is naturally in someone indeed, not in \nseveral, as this whiteness, which is in this body. As to the first, \nmatter is the principle of individuation of all inherent forms, because, \nsince these forms, considered in themselves, are naturally in something \nas in a subject, from the very fact that one of them is received in \nmatter, which is not in another, it follows that neither can the form \nitself thus existing be in another. As to the second, it must be \nmaintained that the principle of individuation is dimensive quantity. For \nthat something is naturally in another one solely, is due to the fact \nthat that other is undivided in itself, and distinct from all others. But \nit is on account of quantity that substance can be divided, as is said in \nPhys. i. And therefore dimensive quantity itself is a particular \nprinciple of individuation in forms of this kind, namely, inasmuch as \nforms numerically distinct are in different parts of the matter. Hence \nalso dimensive quantity has of itself a kind of individuation, so that we \ncan imagine several lines of the same species, differing in  position, \nwhich is included in the notion of this quantity; for it belongs to \ndimension for it to be \"quantity having position\" (Aristotle, Categor. \niv), and therefore dimensive quantity can be the subject of the other \naccidents, rather than the other way about.",

And therefore such being can be corrupted by a \ncontrary agent, as the substance of the bread or wine was subject to \ncorruption, and, moreover, was not corrupted except by a preceding \nalteration regarding the  accidents.\nNevertheless, a distinction must be made between each of the aforesaid \ncorruptions; because, when the body and the blood of Christ succeed in \nthis sacrament to the substance of the bread and wine, if there be such \nchange on the part of the accidents as would not have sufficed for the \ncorruption of the bread and wine, then the body and blood of Christ do \nnot cease to be under this sacrament on account of such change, whether \nthe change be on the part of the quality, as for instance, when the color \nor the savor of the bread or wine is slightly modified; or on the part of \nthe quantity, as when the bread or the wine is divided into such parts as \nto keep in them the nature of bread or of wine. But if the change be so \ngreat that the substance of the bread or wine would have been corrupted, \nthen Christ's body and blood do not remain under this sacrament; and this \neither on the part of the qualities, as when the color, savor, and other \nqualities of the bread and wine are so altered as to be incompatible with \nthe nature of bread or of wine; or else on the part of the quantity, as, \nfor instance, if the bread be reduced to fine particles, or the wine \ndivided into such tiny drops that the species of bread or wine no longer \nremain.",

But there is no matter underlying the sacramental \nspecies except that of Christ's body, and that body is incorruptible. \nTherefore it seems that nothing can be generated from the sacramental \nspecies.",
        "OB2": "Further, things which are not of the same genus cannot spring \nfrom one another: thus a line is not made of whiteness. But accident and \nsubstance differ generically.

        "OB3": "Further, if any corporeal substance be generated from them, such \nsubstance will not be without accident. Therefore, if any corporeal \nsubstance be generated from the sacramental species, then substance and \naccident would be generated from accident, namely, two things from one, \nwhich is impossible. Consequently, it is impossible for any corporeal \nsubstance to be generated out of the sacramental species.",
        "CON": "The senses are witness that something is generated out \nof the sacramental species, either ashes, if they be burned, worms if \nthey putrefy, or dust if they be crushed.",
        "ANS": "Since \"the corruption of one thing is the generation of \nanother\" (De Gener. i), something must be generated necessarily from the \nsacramental species if they be corrupted, as stated above (Article [4]); for \nthey are not corrupted in such a way that they disappear altogether, as \nif reduced to nothing; on the contrary, something sensible manifestly \nsucceeds to them.\nNevertheless, it is difficult to see how anything can be generated from \nthem. For it is quite evident that nothing is generated out of the body \nand blood of Christ which are truly there, because these are \nincorruptible. But if the substance, or even the matter, of the bread and \nwine were to remain in this sacrament, then, as some have maintained, it \nwould be easy to account for this sensible object which succeeds to them. \nBut that supposition is false, as was stated above (Question [75], Articles [2],4,8).\nHence it is that others have said that the things generated have not \nsprung from the sacramental species, but from the surrounding atmosphere. \nBut this can be shown in many ways to be impossible. In the first place, \nbecause when a thing is generated from another, the latter at first \nappears changed and corrupted; whereas no alteration or corruption \nappeared previously in the adjacent atmosphere; hence the worms or ashes \nare not generated therefrom. Secondly, because the nature of the \natmosphere is not such as to permit of such things being generated by \nsuch alterations. Thirdly, because it is possible for many consecrated \nhosts to be burned or putrefied; nor would it be possible for an earthen \nbody, large enough to be generated from the atmosphere, unless a great \nand, in fact, exceedingly sensible condensation of the atmosphere took \nplace. Fourthly, because the same thing can happen to the solid bodies \nsurrounding them, such as iron or stone, which remain entire after the \ngeneration of the aforesaid things. Hence this opinion cannot stand, \nbecause it is opposed to what is manifest to our senses.\nAnd therefore others have said that the substance of the bread and wine \nreturns during the corruption of the species, and so from the returning \nsubstance of the bread and wine, ashes or worms or something of the kind \nare generated. But this explanation seems an impossible one. First of \nall, because if the substance of the bread  and wine be converted into \nthe body and blood of Christ, as was shown above (Question [75], Articles [2],4), the \nsubstance of the bread and wine cannot return, except the body and blood \nof Christ be again changed back into the substance of bread and wine, \nwhich is impossible: thus if air be turned into fire, the air cannot \nreturn without the fire being again changed into air. But if the \nsubstance of bread or wine be annihilated, it cannot return again, \nbecause what lapses into nothing does not return numerically the same. \nUnless perchance it be said that the said substance returns, because God \ncreates anew another new substance to replace the first. Secondly, this \nseems to be impossible, because no time can be assigned when the \nsubstance of the bread returns. For, from what was said above (Article [4]; Question [76], Article [6], ad 3), it is evident that while the species of the bread and \nwine remain, there remain also the body and blood of Christ, which are \nnot present together with the substance of the bread and wine in this \nsacrament, according to what was stated above (Question [75], Article [2]). Hence the \nsubstance of the bread and wine cannot return while the sacramental \nspecies remain; nor, again, when these species pass away; because then \nthe substance of the bread and wine would be without their proper \naccidents, which is impossible. Unless perchance it be said that in the \nlast instant of the corruption of the species there returns (not, indeed, \nthe substance of bread and wine, because it is in that very instant that \nthey have the being of the substance generated from the species, but) the \nmatter of the bread and wine; which, matter, properly speaking, would be \nmore correctly described as created anew, than as returning. And in this \nsense the aforesaid position might be held.\nHowever, since it does not seem reasonable to say that anything takes \nplace miraculously in this sacrament, except in virtue of the \nconsecration itself, which does not imply either creation or return of \nmatter, it seems better to say that in the actual consecration it is \nmiraculously bestowed on the dimensive quantity of the bread and wine to \nbe the subject of subsequent forms. Now this is proper to matter; and \ntherefore as a consequence everything which goes with matter is bestowed \non dimensive quantity; and therefore everything which could be generated \nfrom the matter of bread or wine, if it were present, can be generated \nfrom the aforesaid dimensive quantity of the bread or wine, not, indeed, \nby a new miracle, but by virtue of the miracle which has already taken \nplace.",

But \nit is evident that if the substance of wine were there present, then some \nother liquid could be mingled with it.\nNevertheless there would be a different effect of such mixing both \naccording to the form and according to the quantity of the liquid. For if \nsufficient liquid were mixed so as to spread itself all through the wine, \nthen the whole would be a mixed substance. Now what is made up of things \nmixed is neither of them, but each passes into a third resulting from \nboth: hence it would result that the former wine would remain no longer. \nBut if the liquid added were of another species, for instance, if water \nwere mixed, the species of the wine would be dissolved, and there would \nbe a liquid of another species. But if liquid of the same species were \nadded,  of instance, wine with wine, the same species would remain, but \nthe wine would not be the same numerically, as the diversity of the \naccidents shows: for instance, if one wine were white and the other red.\nBut if the liquid added were of such minute quantity that it could not \npermeate the whole, the entire wine would not be mixed, but only part of \nit, which would not remain the same numerically owing to the blending of \nextraneous matter: still it would remain the same specifically, not only \nif a little liquid of the same species were mixed with it, but even if it \nwere of another species, since a drop of water blended with much wine \npasses into the species of wine (De Gener. i).\nNow it is evident that the body and blood of Christ abide in this \nsacrament so long as the species remain numerically the same, as stated \nabove (Article [4]; Question [76], Article [6], ad 3); because it is this bread and this wine \nwhich is consecrated. Hence, if the liquid of any kind whatsoever added \nbe so much in quantity as to permeate the whole of the consecrated wine, \nand be mixed with it throughout, the result would be something \nnumerically distinct, and the blood of Christ will remain there no \nlonger. But if the quantity of the liquid added be so slight as not to \npermeate throughout, but to reach only a part of the species, Christ's \nblood will cease to be under that part of the consecrated wine, yet will \nremain under the rest.",

Some have said that \nChrist, Who had power of excellence in the sacraments, performed this \nsacrament without using any form of words, and that afterwards He \npronounced the words under which others were to consecrate thereafter. \nAnd the words of Pope Innocent III seem to convey the same sense (De \nSacr.

But even this will not hold good, because the priest in \nconsecrating uses these words, not as spoken in secret, but as openly \npronounced. Accordingly, since these words have no power except from \nChrist pronouncing them, it seems that Christ also consecrated by \npronouncing them openly.\nAnd therefore others said that the Evangelists did not always follow the \nprecise order in their narrative as that in which things actually \nhappened, as is seen from Augustine (De Consens. Evang. ii). Hence it is \nto be understood that the order of what took place can be expressed thus: \n\"Taking the bread He blessed it, saying: This is My body, and then He \nbroke it, and gave it to His disciples.\" But the same sense can be had \neven without changing the words of the Gospel; because the participle \n\"saying\" implies sequence of the words uttered with what goes before. And \nit is not necessary for the sequence to be understood only with respect \nto the last word spoken, as if Christ had just then pronounced those \nwords, when He gave it to His disciples; but the sequence can be \nunderstood with regard to all that had gone before; so that the sense is: \n\"While He was blessing, and breaking, and giving it to His disciples, He \nspoke the words, 'Take ye,'\" etc.",
        "RP2": "In these words, \"Take ye and eat,\" the use of the \nconsecrated, matter is indicated, which is not of the necessity of  this \nsacrament, as stated above (Question [74], Article [7]). And therefore not even these \nwords belong to the substance of the form. Nevertheless, because the use \nof the consecrated matter belongs to a certain perfection of the \nsacrament, in the same way as operation is not the first but the second \nperfection of a thing, consequently, the whole perfection of this \nsacrament is expressed by all those words: and it was in this way that \nEusebius understood that the sacrament was accomplished by those words, \nas to its first and second perfection.",
        "RP3": "In the sacrament of Baptism the minister exercises an act \nregarding the use of the matter, which is of the essence of the \nsacrament: such is not the case in this sacrament; hence there is no \nparallel.",
        "RP4": "Some have contended that this sacrament cannot be \naccomplished by uttering the aforesaid words, while leaving out the rest, \nespecially the words in the Canon of the Mass. But that this is false can \nbe seen both from Ambrose's words quoted above, as well as from the fact \nthat the Canon of the Mass is not the same in all places or times, but \nvarious portions have been introduced by various people.\nAccordingly it must be held that if the priest were to pronounce only \nthe aforesaid words with the intention of consecrating this sacrament, \nthis sacrament would be valid because the intention would cause these \nwords to be understood as spoken in the person of Christ, even though the \nwords were pronounced without those that precede. The priest, however, \nwould sin gravely in consecrating the sacrament thus, as he would not be \nobserving the rite of the Church. Nor does the comparison with Baptism \nprove anything; for it is a sacrament of necessity: whereas the lack of \nthis sacrament can be supplied by the spiritual partaking thereof, as \nAugustine says (cf. Question [73], Article [3], ad 1)."

For it was said (Article [1]) that this consecration consists in changing \nthe substance of bread into the body of Christ. Now the form of a \nsacrament ought to denote what is done in the sacrament. Consequently the \nform for the consecration of the bread ought to signify the actual \nconversion of the bread into the body of Christ. And herein are three \nthings to be considered: namely, the actual conversion, the term \n\"whence,\" and the term \"whereunto.\"\nNow the conversion can be considered in two ways: first, in \"becoming,\" \nsecondly, in \"being.\" But the conversion ought not to be signified in \nthis form as in \"becoming,\" but as in \"being.\" First, because such \nconversion is not successive, as was said above (Question [75], Article [7]), but \ninstantaneous; and in such changes the \"becoming\" is nothing else than \nthe \"being.\" Secondly, because the sacramental forms bear the same \nrelation to the signification of the sacramental effect as artificial \nforms to the representation of the effect of art. Now an artificial form \nis the likeness of the ultimate effect, on which the artist's intention \nis fixed ;. just as the art-form in the builder's mind is principally the \nform of the house constructed, and secondarily of the constructing. \nAccordingly, in this form also the conversion ought to be expressed as in \n\"being,\" to which the intention is referred.\nAnd since the conversion is expressed in this form as in \"being,\" it is \nnecessary for the extremes of the conversion to be signified as they \nexist in the fact of conversion. But then the term \"whereunto\" has the \nproper nature of its own substance; whereas the term \"whence\" does not \nremain in its own substance, but only as to the accidents whereby it \ncomes under the senses, and can be determined in relation to the senses. \nHence the term \"whence\" of  the conversion is conveniently expressed by \nthe demonstrative pronoun, relative to the sensible accidents which \ncontinue; but the term \"whereunto\" is expressed by the noun signifying \nthe nature of the thing which terminates the conversion, and this is \nChrist's entire body, and not merely His flesh; as was said above (Question [76], Article [1], ad 2).

This is called the \"Sacrament of Charity,\" as being figurative and \neffective thereof.\nReply to Objection 7: As stated above (ad 2), the blood consecrated apart \nrepresents Christ's blood more expressively; and therefore mention is \nmade of Christ's Passion and its fruits, in the consecration of the blood \nrather than in that of the body.\nReply to Objection 8: The blood of Christ's Passion has its efficacy not merely \nin the elect among the Jews, to whom the blood of the Old Testament was \nexhibited, but also in the Gentiles; nor only in priests who consecrate \nthis sacrament, and in those others who partake of it; but likewise in \nthose for whom it is offered. And therefore He says expressly, \"for you,\" \nthe Jews, \"and for many,\" namely the Gentiles; or, \"for you\" who eat of \nit, and \"for many,\" for whom it is offered.\nReply to Objection 9: The Evangelists did not intend to hand down the forms of \nthe sacraments, which in the primitive Church had to be kept concealed, \nas Dionysius observes at the close of his book on the ecclesiastical \nhierarchy; their object was to write the story of Christ.

Some have \nsaid that in this expression, \"This is My body,\" the word \"this\" implies \ndemonstration as conceived, and not as exercised, because the whole \nphrase is taken materially, since it is uttered by a way of narration: \nfor the priest relates that Christ said: \"This is My body.\"\nBut such a view cannot hold good, because then these words would not be \napplied to the corporeal matter present, and consequently the sacrament \nwould not be valid: for Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): \"The word \nis added to the element, and this becomes a sacrament.\" Moreover this \nsolution ignores entirely the difficulty which this question presents: \nfor there is still the objection in regard to the first uttering of these \nwords by Christ; since it is evident that then they were employed, not \nmaterially, but significatively. And therefore it must be said that even \nwhen spoken by the priest they are taken significatively, and not merely \nmaterially. Nor does it matter that the priest pronounces them by way of \nrecital, as though they were spoken by Christ, because owing to Christ's \ninfinite power, just as through contact with His flesh the regenerative \npower entered not only into the waters which came into contact with \nChrist, but into all waters throughout the whole world and during all \nfuture ages, so likewise from Christ's uttering these words they derived \ntheir consecrating power, by whatever priest they be uttered, as if \nChrist present were saying them.\nAnd therefore others have said that in this phrase the word \"this\" \nappeals, not to the senses, but to the intellect; so that the meaning is, \n\"This is My body\"---i.e. \"The thing signified by 'this' is My body.\" But \nneither can this stand, because, since in the sacraments the effect is \nthat which is signified, from such a form it would not result that \nChrist's body was in very truth in this sacrament, but merely as in a \nsign, which is heretical, as stated above (Question [85], Article [1]).\nConsequently, others have said that the word \"this\" appeals to the \nsenses; not at the precise instant of its being uttered, but merely at \nthe last instant thereof; as when a man says, \"Now I am silent,\" this \nadverb \"now\" points to the instant immediately following the speech: \nbecause the sense is: \"Directly these words are spoken I am silent.\" But \nneither can this hold good, because in that case the meaning of the \nsentence would be: \"My body is My body,\" which the above phrase does not \neffect, because this was so even before the utterance of the words: hence \nneither does the aforesaid sentence mean this.\nConsequently, then, it remains to be said, as stated above (Article [4]), that \nthis sentence possesses the power of effecting the conversion of the \nbread into the body of Christ. And therefore it is compared to other \nsentences, which have power only of signifying and not of producing, as \nthe concept of the practical intellect, which is productive of the thing, \nis compared to the concept of our speculative intellect which is drawn \nfrom things. because \"words are signs of concepts,\" as the Philosopher \nsays (Peri Herm. i).

And therefore the thing signified must be present \ninstantaneously, and such is the effect of this sacrament; otherwise it \nwould not be a true speech. Moreover, this opinion is against the rite of \nthe Church, which forthwith adores the body of Christ after the words are \nuttered.\nHence it must be said that the first form does not await the second in \nits action, but has its effect on the instant.",

Therefore \ngrace is not bestowed through this sacrament, at least so far as the body \nis concerned.",
        "CON": "Our Lord says (Jn. 6:52): \"The bread which I will give, \nis My flesh for the life of the world.\" But the spiritual life is the \neffect of grace. Therefore grace is bestowed through this sacrament.",
        "ANS": "The effect of this sacrament ought to be considered, \nfirst of all and principally, from what is contained in this sacrament, \nwhich is Christ; Who, just as by coming into the world, He visibly \nbestowed the life of grace upon the world, according to Jn. 1:17: \"Grace \nand truth came by Jesus Christ,\" so also, by coming sacramentally into \nman causes the life of grace, according to Jn. 6:58: \"He that eateth Me, \nthe same also shall live by Me.\" Hence Cyril says on Lk. 22:19: \"God's \nlife-giving Word by uniting Himself with His own flesh, made it to be \nproductive of life. For it was becoming that He should be united somehow \nwith bodies through His sacred flesh and precious blood, which we receive \nin a life-giving blessing in the bread and wine.\"\nSecondly, it is considered on the part of what is represented by this \nsacrament, which is Christ's Passion, as stated above (Question [74], Article [1]; Question [76], Article [2], ad 1). And therefore this sacrament works in man the effect which \nChrist's Passion wrought in the world. Hence, Chrysostom says on the \nwords, \"Immediately there came out blood and water\" (Jn. 19:34): \"Since \nthe sacred mysteries derive their origin from thence, when you draw nigh \nto the awe-inspiring chalice, so approach as if you were going to drink \nfrom Christ's own side.\"  Hence our Lord Himself says (Mt. 26:28): \"This \nis My blood . . . which shall be shed for many unto the remission of \nsins.\"\nThirdly, the effect of this sacrament is considered from the way in \nwhich this sacrament is given; for it is given by way of food and drink. \nAnd therefore this sacrament does for the spiritual life all that \nmaterial food does for the bodily life, namely, by sustaining, giving \nincrease, restoring, and giving delight. Accordingly, Ambrose says (De \nSacram. v): \"This is the bread of everlasting life, which supports the \nsubstance of our soul.\" And Chrysostom says (Hom. xlvi in Joan.): \"When \nwe desire it, He lets us feel Him, and eat Him, and embrace Him.\" And \nhence our Lord says (Jn. 6:56): \"My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is \ndrink indeed.\"\nFourthly, the effect of this sacrament is considered from the species \nunder which it is given. Hence Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): \n\"Our Lord betokened His body and blood in things which out of many units \nare made into some one whole: for out of many grains is one thing made,\" \nviz. bread; \"and many grapes flow into one thing,\" viz. wine. And \ntherefore he observes elsewhere (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): \"O sacrament of \npiety, O sign of unity, O bond of charity!\"\nAnd since Christ and His Passion are the cause of grace. and since \nspiritual refreshment, and charity cannot be without grace, it is clear \nfrom all that has been set forth that this sacrament bestows grace.",
        "RP1": "This sacrament has of itself the power of bestowing grace; \nnor does anyone possess grace before receiving this sacrament except from \nsome desire thereof; from his own desire, as in the case of the adult. or \nfrom the Church's desire in the case of children, as stated above (Question [73], Article [3]). Hence it is due to the efficacy of its power, that even from \ndesire thereof a man procures grace whereby he is enabled to lead the \nspiritual life. It remains, then, that when the sacrament itself is \nreally received, grace is increased, and the spiritual life perfected: \nyet in different fashion from the sacrament of Confirmation, in which \ngrace is increased and perfected for resisting the outward assaults of \nChrist's enemies. But by this sacrament grace receives increase, and the \nspiritual life is perfected, so that man may stand perfect in himself by \nunion with God.",
        "RP2": "This sacrament confers grace spiritually together with the \nvirtue of charity. Hence Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv) compares this \nsacrament to the burning coal which Isaias saw (Is. 6:6): \"For a live \nember is not simply wood, but wood united to fire; so also the bread of \ncommunion is not simple bread but bread united with the Godhead.\" But as \nGregory observes in a Homily for Pentecost, \"God's love is never idle; \nfor, wherever it is it does great works.\" And consequently through this \nsacrament, as far as its power is concerned, not only is the habit of \ngrace and of virtue bestowed, but it is furthermore aroused to act, \naccording to  2 Cor. 5:14: \"The charity of Christ presseth us.\" Hence it \nis that the soul is spiritually nourished through the power of this \nsacrament, by being spiritually gladdened, and as it were inebriated with \nthe sweetness of the Divine goodness, according to Cant 5:1: \"Eat, O \nfriends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.\"",

And although the body is not the immediate subject of \ngrace, still the effect of grace flows into the body while in the present \nlife we present \"our [Vulg.: 'your'] members\" as \"instruments of justice \nunto God\" (Rm. 6:13), and in the life to come our body will share in the \nincorruption and the glory of the soul."

Because it was by His Passion that  Christ \nopened to us the approach to eternal life, according to Heb. 9:15: \"He is \nthe Mediator of the New Testament; that by means of His death . . . they \nthat are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.\" \nAccordingly in the form of this sacrament it is said: \"This is the \nchalice of My blood, of the New and Eternal Testament.\"\nIn like manner the refreshment of spiritual food and the unity denoted \nby the species of the bread and wine are to be had in the present life, \nalthough imperfectly. but perfectly in the state of glory. Hence \nAugustine says on the words, \"My flesh is meat indeed\" (Jn. 6:56): \n\"Seeing that in meat and drink, men aim at this, that they hunger not nor \nthirst, this verily nought doth afford save only this meat and drink \nwhich maketh them who partake thereof to be immortal and incorruptible, \nin the fellowship of the saints, where shall be peace, and unity, full \nand perfect.\"",

And therefore it is called \n\"Viaticum,\" a figure whereof we read in 3 Kgs. 19:8: \"Elias ate and \ndrank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty \nnights unto the mount of God, Horeb.\"",

Now whoever is conscious of mortal \nsin, has within him an obstacle to receiving the effect of this \nsacrament; since he is not a proper recipient of this sacrament, both \nbecause he is not alive spiritually, and so he ought not to eat the \nspiritual nourishment, since nourishment is confined to the living; and \nbecause he cannot be united with Christ, which is the effect of this \nsacrament, as long as he retains an attachment towards mortal sin. \nConsequently, as is said in the book De Eccles.

Secondly, when received by one in \nmortal sin of which he is not conscious, and for which he has no \nattachment; since possibly he was not sufficiently contrite at first, but \nby approaching this sacrament devoutly and reverently he obtains the \ngrace of charity, which will perfect his contrition and bring forgiveness \nof sin.",

Essentially, in regard to its \nspecies, which is taken from its object: and so a sin is greater \naccording as that against which it is committed is greater. And since \nChrist's Godhead is greater than His humanity, and His humanity greater \nthan the sacraments of His humanity, hence it is that those are the \ngravest sins which are committed against the Godhead, such as unbelief \nand blasphemy. The second degree of gravity is held by those sins which \nare committed against His humanity: hence it is written (Mt. 12:32): \n\"Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be \nforgiven him; but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall \nnot be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.\" In \nthe third place come sins committed against the sacraments, which belong \nto Christ's humanity; and after these are the other sins committed \nagainst mere creatures.\nAccidentally, one sin can be graver than another on the sinner's part. \nfor example, the sin which is the result of ignorance or of weakness is \nlighter than one arising from contempt, or from sure knowledge; and the \nsame reason holds good of other circumstances. And according to this, the \nabove sin can be graver in some, as happens in them who from actual \ncontempt and with consciousness of sin approach this sacrament: but in \nothers it is less grave; for instance, in those who from fear of their \nsin being discovered, approach this sacrament with consciousness of sin.\nSo, then, it is evident that this sin is specifically graver than many \nothers, yet it is not the greatest of all.",

And this resemblance \nin crime applies no less to other sinners than to fornicators: because by \nother mortal sins, sinners act against the charity of Christ, of which \nthis sacrament is the sign, and all the more according as their sins are \ngraver. But in a measure the sin of fornication makes one more unfit for \nreceiving this sacrament, because thereby especially the spirit becomes \nenslaved by the flesh, which is a hindrance to the fervor of love \nrequired for this sacrament.\nHowever, the hindrance to charity itself weighs more than the hindrance \nto its fervor. Hence the sin of unbelief, which fundamentally severs a \nman from the unity of the Church, simply speaking, makes him to be \nutterly unfit for receiving this sacrament; because it is the sacrament \nof the Church's unity, as stated above (Question [61], Article [2]). Hence the \nunbeliever who receives this sacrament sins more grievously than the \nbeliever who is in sin; and shows greater contempt towards Christ Who is \nin the sacrament, especially if he does not believe Christ to be truly in \nthis sacrament; because, so far as lies in him, he lessens the holiness \nof the sacrament, and the power of Christ acting in it, and this is to \ndespise the sacrament in itself. But the believer who receives the \nsacrament with consciousness of sin, by receiving it unworthily despises \nthe sacrament, not in itself, but in its use. Hence the Apostle (1 Cor. 11:29) in assigning the cause of this sin, says, \"not discerning the body \nof the Lord,\" that is, not distinguishing it from other food: and this is \nwhat he does who disbelieves Christ's presence in this sacrament.",

Therefore Holy Communion ought not to \nbe given to open sinners when they ask for it. Hence Cyprian writes to \nsomeone (Ep. lxi): \"You were so kind as to consider that I ought to be \nconsulted regarding actors, end that magician who continues to practice \nhis disgraceful arts among you; as to whether I thought that Holy \nCommunion ought to be given to such with the other Christians. I think \nthat it is beseeming neither the Divine majesty, nor Christian \ndiscipline, for the Church's modesty and honor to be defiled by such \nshameful and infamous contagion.\"\nBut if they be not open sinners, but occult, the Holy Communion should \nnot be denied them if they ask for it. For since every Christian, from \nthe fact that he is baptized, is admitted to the Lord's table, he may not \nbe robbed of his right, except from some open cause. Hence on 1 Cor. \n5:11, \"If he who is called a brother among you,\" etc., Augustine's gloss \nremarks: \"We cannot  inhibit any person from Communion, except he has \nopenly confessed, or has been named and convicted by some ecclesiastical \nor lay tribunal.\" Nevertheless a priest who has knowledge of the crime \ncan privately warn the secret sinner, or warn all openly in public, from \napproaching the Lord's table, until they have repented of their sins and \nhave been reconciled to the Church; because after repentance and \nreconciliation, Communion must not be refused even to public sinners, \nespecially in the hour of death. Hence in the (3rd) Council of Carthage \n(Can. xxxv) we read: \"Reconciliation is not to be denied to stage-players \nor actors, or others of the sort, or to apostates, after their conversion \nto God.\"",

Hence Augustine says (Quaest. super Gen. 42): \n\"It is a most dangerous exchange, for us to do evil lest another \nperpetrate a greater evil.\" But the secret sinner ought rather to prefer \ninfamy than approach the Lord's table unworthily.\nYet by no means should an unconsecrated host be given in place of a \nconsecrated one; because the priest by so doing, so far as he is \nconcerned, makes others, either the bystanders or the communicant, commit \nidolatry by believing that it is a consecrated host; because, as \nAugustine says on Ps. 98:5: \"Let no one eat Christ's flesh, except he \nfirst adore it.\" Hence in the Decretals (Extra, De Celeb. Miss., Ch.

Ex \ntuarum). Because in all such practices there seems to be a tempting of \nGod; hence such things cannot be done without sin. And it would seem \ngraver still if anyone were to incur judgment of death through this \nsacrament, which was instituted as a means of salvation.

Sometimes they are due to an external spiritual cause, viz. \nthe deception of the demons, who can stir up phantasms, as was stated in \nthe FP, Question [111], Article [3], through the apparition of which, these movements \noccasionally follow. Sometimes they are due to an internal spiritual \ncause, such as previous thoughts. At other times they arise from some \ninternal corporeal cause, as from abundance or weakness of nature, or \neven from surfeit of meat or drink. Now every one of these three causes \ncan be without sin at all, or else with venial sin, or with mortal sin. \nIf it be without sin, or with venial sin, it does not necessarily prevent \nthe receiving of this sacrament, so as to make a man guilty of the body \nand blood of the Lord: but should it be with mortal sin, it prevents it \nof necessity.\nFor such illusions on the part of demons sometimes come from one's not \nstriving to receive fervently; and this can be either a mortal or a \nvenial sin. At other times it is due to malice alone on the part of the \ndemons who wish to keep men from receiving this sacrament. So we read in \nthe Conferences of the Fathers (Cassian, Collat. xxii) that when a \ncertain one always suffered thus on those feast-days on which he had to \nreceive Communion, his superiors, discovering that there was no fault on \nhis part, ruled that he was not to refrain from communicating on that \naccount, and the demoniacal illusion ceased.\nIn like fashion previous evil thoughts can sometimes be without any sin \nwhatever, as when one has to think of such things on account of lecturing \nor debating; and if it be done without concupiscence and delectation, the \nthoughts will not be unclean but honest; and yet defilement can come of \nsuch thoughts, as is clear from the authority of Augustine (Objection [1]). At \nother times such thoughts come of concupiscence and delectation, and \nshould there be consent, it will be a mortal sin: otherwise it will be a \nvenial sin.\nIn the same way too the corporeal cause can be without sin, as when it \narises from bodily debility, and hence some individuals suffer seminal \nloss without sin even in their wakeful hours; or it  can come from the \nabundance of nature: for, just as blood can flow without sin, so also can \nthe semen which is superfluity of the blood, according to the Philosopher \n(De Gener. Animal. i). But occasionally it is with sin, as when it is due \nto excess of food or drink. And this also can be either venial or mortal \nsin; although more frequently the sin is mortal in the case of evil \nthoughts on account of the proneness to consent, rather than in the case \nof consumption of food and drink. Hence Gregory, writing to Augustine, \nBishop of the English (Regist. xi), says that one ought to refrain from \nCommunion when this arises from evil thoughts, but not when it arises \nfrom excess of food or drink, especially if necessity call for Communion. \nSo, then, one must judge from its cause whether such bodily defilement of \nnecessity hinders the receiving of this sacrament.\nAt the same time a sense of decency forbids Communion on two accounts. \nThe first of these is always verified, viz. the bodily defilement, with \nwhich, out of reverence for the sacrament, it is unbecoming to approach \nthe altar (and hence those who wish to touch any sacred object, wash \ntheir hands): except perchance such uncleanness be perpetual or of long \nstanding, such as leprosy or issue of blood, or anything else of the \nkind. The other reason is the mental distraction which follows after the \naforesaid movements, especially when they take place with unclean \nimaginings. Now this obstacle, which arises from a sense of decency, can \nbe set aside owing to any necessity, as Gregory says (Regist. xi): \"As \nwhen perchance either a festival day calls for it, or necessity compels \none to exercise the ministry because there is no other priest at hand.\"",
        "RP1": "A person is hindered necessarily, only by mortal sin, from \nreceiving this sacrament: but from a sense of decency one may be hindered \nthrough other causes, as stated above.",
        "RP2": "Conjugal intercourse, if it be without sin, (for instance, \nif it be done for the sake of begetting offspring, or of paying the \nmarriage debt), does not prevent the receiving of this sacrament for any \nother reason than do those movements in question which happen without \nsin, as stated above; namely, on account of the defilement to the body \nand distraction to the mind. On this account Jerome expresses himself in \nthe following terms in his commentary on Matthew (Epist. xxviii, among \nSt. Jerome's works): \"If the loaves of Proposition might not be eaten by \nthem who had known their wives carnally, how much less may this bread \nwhich has come down from heaven be defiled and touched by them who \nshortly before have been in conjugal embraces? It is not that we condemn \nmarriages, but that at the time when we are going to eat the flesh of the \nLamb, we ought not to indulge in carnal acts.\" But since this is to be \nunderstood in the sense of decency, and not of necessity, Gregory says \nthat such a person \"is to be left to his own judgment.\" \"But if,\" as \nGregory says (Regist. xi), \"it be not desire of begetting offspring, but \nlust that prevails,\" then such a one should be forbidden to approach this \nsacrament.",

But one may take food and drink after \nreceiving the sacrament. Therefore one may do so before receiving it.\nReply to  That this sacrament ought to enter into the mouth of a \nChristian before any other food must not be understood absolutely of all \ntime, otherwise he who had once eaten or drunk could never afterwards \ntake this sacrament: but it must be understood of the same day; and \nalthough the beginning of the day varies according to different systems \nof reckoning (for some begin their day at noon, some at sunset, others at \nmidnight, and others at sunrise), the Roman Church begins it at midnight. \nConsequently, if any person takes anything by way of food or drink after \nmidnight, he may not receive this sacrament on that day; but he can do so \nif the food was taken before midnight. Nor does it matter, so far as the \nprecept is concerned, whether he has slept after taking food or drink, or \nwhether he has digested it; but it does matter as to the mental \ndisturbance which one suffers from want of sleep or from indigestion, \nfor, if the mind be much disturbed, one becomes unfit for receiving this \nsacrament.\nReply to Objection 6: The greatest devotion is called for at the moment of \nreceiving this sacrament, because it is then that the effect of the \nsacrament is bestowed, and such devotion is hindered more by what goes \nbefore it than by what comes after it. And therefore it was ordained that \nmen should fast before receiving the sacrament  rather than after. \nNevertheless there ought to be some interval between receiving this \nsacrament and taking other food. Consequently, both the Postcommunion \nprayer of thanksgiving is said in the Mass, and the communicants say \ntheir own private prayers.\nHowever, according to the ancient Canons, the following ordination was \nmade by Pope Clement I, (Ep. ii), \"If the Lord's portion be eaten in the \nmorning, the ministers who have taken it shall fast until the sixth hour, \nand if they take it at the third or fourth hour, they shall fast until \nevening.\" For in olden times, the priest celebrated Mass less frequently, \nand with greater preparation: but now, because the sacred mysteries have \nto be celebrated oftener, the same could not be easily observed, and so \nit has been abrogated by contrary custom.",

Nor does \nit matter whether it nourishes or not, whether it be taken by itself or \nwith other things, provided it be taken by way of food or drink.

Consequently, if anyone finds that he has these \ndispositions every day, he will do well to receive it daily. Hence, \nAugustine after saying, \"Receive daily, that it may profit thee daily,\" \nadds: \"So live, as to deserve to receive it daily.\" But because many \npersons are lacking in this devotion, on account of the many drawbacks \nboth spiritual and corporal from which they suffer, it is not expedient \nfor all to approach this sacrament every day; but they should do so as \noften as they find themselves properly disposed.

Hence it is written (Heb. 10:14): \"By one \noblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\" \nConsequently, since man has daily need of Christ's health-giving virtue, \nhe may commendably receive this sacrament every day.\nAnd since Baptism is above all a spiritual regeneration, therefore, as a \nman is born naturally but once, so ought he by Baptism to be reborn \nspiritually but once, as Augustine says (Tract. xi in Joan.), commenting \non Jn. 3:4, \"How can a man be born again, when he is grown old?\" But this \nsacrament is spiritual food; hence, just as bodily food is taken every \nday, so is it a good thing to receive this sacrament every day. Hence it \nis that our Lord (Lk. 11:3), teaches us to pray, \"Give us this day our \ndaily bread\": in explaining which words Augustine observes (De Verb. \nDom., Serm. xxviii): \"If you receive it,\" i.e. this sacrament, every day, \n\"every day is today for thee, and Christ rises again every day in thee, \nfor when Christ riseth it is today.\"",

Nevertheless, lest the Church be deprived on that day of the \nfruit of the Passion offered to us by this sacrament, the body of Christ \nconsecrated the day before is reserved to be consumed on that day; but \nthe blood is not reserved, on account of danger, and because the blood is \nmore specially the image of our Lord's Passion, as stated above (Question [78], Article [3], ad 2). Nor is it true, as some affirm, that the wine is changed \ninto blood when the particle of Christ's body is dropped into it. Because \nthis cannot be done otherwise than by consecration under the due form of \nwords.\nOn Christmas Day, however, several masses are said on account of \nChrist's threefold nativity. Of these the first is His eternal birth, \nwhich is hidden in our regard. and therefore one mass is sung in the \nnight, in the \"Introit\" of which we say: \"The Lord said unto Me: Thou art \nMy Son, this day have I begotten Thee.\" The second is His nativity in \ntime, and the spiritual birth, whereby Christ rises \"as the day-star in \nour [Vulg.: 'your'] hearts\" (2 Pt. 1:19), and on this account the mass is \nsung at dawn, and in the \"Introit\" we say: \"The light will shine on us \ntoday.\" The third is Christ's temporal and bodily birth, according as He \nwent forth from the virginal womb, becoming visible to us through being \nclothed with flesh: and on that account the third mass is sung in broad \ndaylight, in the \"Introit\" of which we say: \"A child is born to us.\" \nNevertheless, on the other hand, it can be said that His eternal \ngeneration, of itself, is in the full light, and on this account in the \ngospel of the third mass mention is made of His eternal birth. But \nregarding His birth in the body, He was literally born during the night, \nas a sign that He came to the darknesses of our infirmity; hence also in \nthe midnight mass we say the gospel of Christ's nativity in the flesh.\nLikewise on other days upon which many of God's benefits have to be \nrecalled or besought, several masses are celebrated on one day, as for \ninstance, one for the feast, and another for a fast or for the dead.",

But we celebrate at the hour when our Lord suffered, \ni.e. either, as on feast-days, at the hour of Terce, when He was \ncrucified by the tongues of the Jews (Mk. 15:25), and when the Holy Ghost \ndescended upon the disciples (Acts 2:15); or, as when no feast is kept, \nat the hour of Sext, when He was crucified at the hands of the soldiers \n(Jn. 19:14), or, as on fasting days, at None, when crying out with a loud \nvoice He gave up the ghost (Mt. 27:46,50).\nNevertheless the mass can be postponed, especially when Holy  orders \nhave to be conferred, and still more on Holy Saturday; both on account of \nthe length of the office, and also because orders belong to the Sunday, \nas is set forth in the Decretals (dist. 75).\nMasses, however, can be celebrated \"in the first part of the day,\" owing \nto any necessity; as is stated De Consecr., dist. 1.",

Accordingly it is written (Mk. 16:1) \nthat \"the women came to the tomb, the sun being now risen\"; though, as \nJohn relates (Jn. 20:1), \"while it was yet dark they came to the tomb.\" \nIt is in this way that Augustine explains this difference (De Consens. \nEvang. iii).\nException is made on the night of Christmas eve, when mass is \ncelebrated, because our Lord was born in the night (De Consecr., dist. \n1). And in like manner it is celebrated on Holy Saturday towards the \nbeginning of the night, since our Lord rose in the night, that is, \"when \nit was yet dark, before the sun's rising was manifest.\""

        "question": "Whether this sacrament ought to be celebrated in a house and with sacred vessels?",
        "OB1": "It seems that this sacrament ought not to be celebrated in a \nhouse and with sacred vessels. For this sacrament is a representation of \nour Lord's Passion. But Christ did not suffer in a house, but outside the \ncity gate, according to Heb. 1:12: \"Jesus, that He might sanctify the \npeople by His own blood, suffered without the gate.\" Therefore, it seems \nthat this sacrament ought not to be celebrated in a house, but rather in \nthe open air.",
        "OB2": "Further, in the celebration of this sacrament the Church ought to \nimitate the custom of Christ and the apostles. But the house wherein \nChrist first wrought this sacrament was not consecrated, but merely an \nordinary supper-room prepared by the master of the house, as related in \nLk. 22:11,12. Moreover, we read (Acts 2:46) that \"the apostles were \ncontinuing daily with one accord in the temple; and, breaking bread from \nhouse to house, they took their meat with gladness.\" Consequently, there \nis no need for houses, in which this sacrament is celebrated, to be \nconsecrated.",
        "OB3": "Further, nothing that is to no purpose ought to be done in the \nChurch, which is governed by the Holy Ghost. But it seems useless to \nconsecrate a church, or an altar, or such like inanimate things, since \nthey are not capable of receiving grace or spiritual virtue. Therefore it \nis unbecoming for such consecrations to be performed in the Church.",
        "OB4": "Further, only Divine works ought to be recalled with solemnity, \naccording to Ps. 91:5: \"I shall rejoice in the works of Thy hands.\" Now \nthe consecration of a church or altar, is the work of a man; as is also \nthe consecration of the chalice, and of the ministers, and of other such \nthings. But these latter consecrations are not commemorated in the \nChurch. Therefore neither ought the consecration of a church or of an \naltar to be commemorated with solemnity.",
        "OB5": "Further, the truth ought to correspond with the figure. But in \nthe Old Testament, which was a figure of the New, the altar was not made \nof hewn stones: for, it is written (Ex. 20:24): \"You shall make an altar \nof earth unto Me . . . and if thou make an altar of stone unto Me, thou \nshalt not build it of hewn stones.\" Again, the altar is commanded to be \nmade of \"setim-wood,\" covered \"with brass\" (Ex. 27:1,2), or \"with gold\" \n(Ex. 25). Consequently, it seems unfitting for the Church to make \nexclusive use of altars made of stone.\nObjection 6: Further, the chalice with the paten represents Christ's tomb, \nwhich was \"hewn in a rock,\" as is narrated in the Gospels. Consequently, \nthe chalice ought to be of stone, and not of gold or of silver or tin.\nObjection 7: Further, just as gold is the most precious among the materials of \nthe altar vessels, so are cloths of silk the most precious among other \ncloths. Consequently, since the chalice is of gold, the altar cloths \nought to be made of silk and not of linen.\nObjection 8: Further, the dispensing and ordering of the sacraments belong to \nthe Church's ministers, just as the ordering of temporal affairs is \nsubject to the ruling of secular princes; hence the Apostle says (1 Cor. 4:1): \"Let a man so esteem us as the ministers of Christ end the \ndispensers of the mysteries of God.\" But if anything be done against the \nordinances of princes it is deemed void. Therefore, if the various items \nmentioned above are suitably commanded by the Church's prelates, it seems \nthat the body of  Christ could not be consecrated unless they be \nobserved; and so it appears to follow that Christ's words are not \nsufficient of themselves for consecrating this sacrament: which is \ncontrary to the fact. Consequently, it does not seem fitting for such \nordinances to be made touching the celebration of this sacrament.\nReply to  As we read in De Consecr., dist. 1, \"altars, if not of \nstone, are not to be consecrated with the anointing of chrism.\" And this \nis in keeping with the signification of this sacrament; both because the \naltar signifies Christ, for in 1 Cor. 10:3, it is written, \"But the rock \nwas Christ\": and because Christ's body was laid in a stone sepulchre. \nThis is also in keeping with the use of the sacrament. Because stone is \nsolid, and may be found everywhere. which was not necessary in the old \nLaw, when the altar was made in one place. As to the commandment to make \nthe altar of earth, or of unhewn stones, this was given in order to \nremove idolatry.\nReply to Objection 6: As is laid down in the same distinction, \"formerly the \npriests did not use golden but wooden chalices; but Pope Zephyrinus \nordered the mass to be said with glass patens; and subsequently Pope \nUrban had everything made of silver.\" Afterwards it was decided that \"the \nLord's chalice with the paten should be made entirely of gold, or of \nsilver or at least of tin. But it is  not to be made of brass, or copper, \nbecause the action of the wine thereon produces verdigris, and provokes \nvomiting. But no one is to presume to sing mass with a chalice of wood or \nof glass,\" because as the wood is porous, the consecrated blood would \nremain in it; while glass is brittle and there might arise danger of \nbreakage; and the same applies to stone. Consequently, out of reverence \nfor the sacrament, it was enacted that the chalice should be made of the \naforesaid materials.\nReply to Objection 7: Where it could be done without danger, the Church gave \norder for that thing to be used which more expressively represents \nChrist's Passion. But there was not so much danger regarding the body \nwhich is placed on the corporal, as there is with the blood contained in \nthe chalice. And consequently, although the chalice is not made of stone, \nyet the corporal is made of linen, since Christ's body was wrapped \ntherein. Hence we read in an Epistle of Pope Silvester, quoted in the \nsame distinction: \"By a unanimous decree we command that no one shall \npresume to celebrate the sacrifice of the altar upon a cloth of silk, or \ndyed material, but upon linen consecrated by the bishop; as Christ's body \nwas buried in a clean linen winding-sheet.\" Moreover, linen material is \nbecoming, owing to its cleanness, to denote purity of conscience, and, \nowing to the manifold labor with which it is prepared, to denote Christ's \nPassion.\nReply to Objection 8: The dispensing of the sacraments belongs to the Church's \nministers; but their consecration is from God Himself. Consequently, the \nChurch's ministers can make no ordinances regarding the form of the \nconsecration, and the manner of celebrating. And therefore, if the priest \npronounces the words of consecration over the proper matter with the \nintention of consecrating, then, without every one of the things \nmentioned above---namely, without house, and altar, consecrated chalice \nand corporal, and the other things instituted by the Church---he \nconsecrates Christ's body in very truth; yet he is guilty of grave sin, \nin not following the rite of the Church.",
        "CON": "The Church's ordinances are Christ's own ordinances; \nsince He said (Mt. 18:20): \"Wherever two or three are gathered together \nin My name, there am I in the midst of them.\"",
        "ANS": "There are two things to be considered regarding the \nequipment of this sacrament: one of these belongs to the representation \nof the events connected with our Lord's Passion; while the other is \nconnected with the reverence due to the sacrament, in which Christ is \ncontained verily, and not in figure only.\nHence we consecrate those things which we make use of in this sacrament; \nboth that we may show our reverence for the sacrament, and in order to \nrepresent the holiness which is the effect of the Passion of Christ, \naccording to Heb. 13:12: \"Jesus, that He might sanctify the people by His \nown blood,\" etc.",
        "RP1": "This sacrament ought as a rule to be celebrated in a house, \nwhereby the Church is signified, according to 1 Tim. 3:15: \"That thou \nmayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, \nwhich is the Church of the living God.\" Because \"outside the Church there \nis no place for the true sacrifice,\" as Augustine says (Liber Sentent. \nProsp. xv). And because the Church was not to be confined within the \nterritories of the Jewish people, but was to be established throughout \nthe whole world, therefore Christ's Passion was not celebrated within the \ncity of the Jews, but in the open country, that so the whole world might \nserve as a house for Christ's Passion. Nevertheless, as is said in De \nConsecr., dist. 1, \"if a church be not to hand, we permit travelers to \ncelebrate mass in the open air, or in a tent, if there be a consecrated \naltar-table to hand, and the other requisites belonging to the sacred \nfunction.\"",
        "RP2": "The house in which this sacrament is celebrated denotes the \nChurch, and is termed a church; and so it is fittingly consecrated, both \nto represent the holiness which the Church acquired from the Passion, as \nwell as to denote the holiness required of them who have to receive this \nsacrament. By the altar Christ Himself is signified, of Whom the Apostle \nsays (Heb. 13:15): \"Through Him we offer a sacrifice of praise to God.\" \nHence the consecration of the altar signifies Christ's holiness, of which \nit was said (Lk. 1:35): \"The Holy one born of thee shall be called the \nSon of God.\" Hence we read in De Consecr., dist. 1: \"It has seemed \npleasing for the altars to be consecrated not merely with the anointing \nof chrism, but likewise with the priestly blessing.\"\nAnd therefore, as a rule, it is not lawful to celebrate this sacrament \nexcept in a consecrated house. Hence it is enacted (De  Consecr., dist. \n1): \"Let no priest presume to say mass except in places consecrated by \nthe bishop.\" And furthermore because pagans and other unbelievers are not \nmembers of the Church, therefore we read (De Consecr., dist. 1): \"It is \nnot lawful to bless a church in which the bodies of unbelievers are \nburied, but if it seem suitable for consecration, then, after removing \nthe corpses and tearing down the walls or beams, let it be rebuilt. If, \nhowever, it has been already consecrated, and the faithful lie in it, it \nis lawful to celebrate mass therein.\" Nevertheless in a case of necessity \nthis sacrament can be performed in houses which have not been \nconsecrated, or which have been profaned; but with the bishop's consent. \nHence we read in the same distinction: \"We deem that masses are not to be \ncelebrated everywhere, but in places consecrated by the bishop, or where \nhe gives permission.\" But not without a portable altar consecrated by the \nbishop: hence in the same distinction we read: \"We permit that, if the \nchurches be devastated or burned, masses may be celebrated in chapels, \nwith a consecrated altar.\" For because Christ's holiness is the fount of \nall the Church's holiness, therefore in necessity a consecrated altar \nsuffices for performing this sacrament. And on this account a church is \nnever consecrated without consecrating the altar. Yet sometimes an altar \nis consecrated apart from the church, with the relics of the saints, \n\"whose lives are hidden with Christ in God\" (Col. 3:3). Accordingly under \nthe same distinction we read: \"It is our pleasure that altars, in which \nno relics of saints are found enclosed, be thrown down, if possible, by \nthe bishops presiding over such places.\"",
        "RP3": "The church, altar, and other like inanimate things are \nconsecrated, not because they are capable of receiving grace, but because \nthey acquire special spiritual virtue from the consecration, whereby they \nare rendered fit for the Divine worship, so that man derives devotion \ntherefrom, making him more fitted for Divine functions, unless this be \nhindered by want of reverence. Hence it is written (2 Macc. 3:38): \"There \nis undoubtedly in that place a certain power of God; for He that hath His \ndwelling in the heavens is the visitor, and the protector of that place.\"\nHence it is that such places are cleansed and exorcised before being \nconsecrated, that the enemy's power may be driven forth. And for the same \nreason churches defiled by shedding of blood or seed are reconciled: \nbecause some machination of the enemy is apparent on account of the sin \ncommitted there. And for this reason we read in the same distinction: \n\"Wherever you find churches of the Arians, consecrate them as Catholic \nchurches without delay by means of devout prayers and rites.\" Hence, too, \nit is that some say with probability, that by entering a consecrated \nchurch one obtains forgiveness of venial sins, just as one does by the \nsprinkling of holy water; alleging the words of Ps. 84:2,3: \"Lord, Thou \nhast blessed Thy land . . . Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy \npeople.\" And therefore, in consequence of the virtue acquired by a \nchurch's consecration, the consecration is never repeated. Accordingly we \nfind in the same distinction the following words quoted from the Council \nof Nicaea: \"Churches which have once been  consecrated, must not be \nconsecrated again, except they be devastated by fire, or defiled by \nshedding of blood or of anyone's seed; because, just as a child once \nbaptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy \nGhost, ought not to be baptized again, so neither ought a place, once \ndedicated to God, to be consecrated again, except owing to the causes \nmentioned above; provided that the consecrators held faith in the Holy \nTrinity\": in fact, those outside the Church cannot consecrate. But, as we \nread in the same distinction: \"Churches or altars of doubtful \nconsecration are to be consecrated anew.\"\nAnd since they acquire special spiritual virtue from their consecration, \nwe find it laid down in the same distinction that \"the beams of a \ndedicated church ought not to be used for any other purpose, except it be \nfor some other church, or else they are to be burned, or put to the use \nof brethren in some monastery: but on no account are they to be discarded \nfor works of the laity.\" We read there, too, that \"the altar covering, \nchair, candlesticks, and veil, are to be burned when warn out; and their \nashes are to be placed in the baptistery, or in the walls, or else cast \ninto the trenches beneath the flag-stones, so as not to be defiled by the \nfeet of those that enter.\"",
        "RP4": "Since the consecration of the altar signifies Christ's \nholiness, and the consecration of a house the holiness of the entire \nChurch, therefore the consecration of a church or of an altar is more \nfittingly commemorated. And on this account the solemnity of a church \ndedication is observed for eight days, in order to signify the happy \nresurrection of Christ and of the Church's members. Nor is the \nconsecration of a church or altar man's doing only, since it has a \nspiritual virtue. Hence in the same distinction (De Consecr.) it is said: \n\"The solemnities of the dedication of churches are to be solemnly \ncelebrated each year: and that dedications are to be kept up for eight \ndays, you will find in the third book of Kings\" (8:66)."

        "OB2": "Further, Christ's words and deeds are made known to us through \nthe Gospel. But in consecrating this sacrament words are used which are \nnot set down in the Gospels: for we do not read in the Gospel, of Christ \nlifting up His eyes to heaven while consecrating this sacrament: and \nsimilarly it is said in the Gospel: \"Take ye and eat\" [comedite] without \nthe addition of the word \"all,\" whereas in celebrating this sacrament we \nsay: \"Lifting up His eyes to heaven,\" and again, \"Take ye and eat \n[manducate] of this.\" Therefore such words as these are out of place when \nspoken  in the celebration of this sacrament.",
        "OB3": "Further, all the other sacraments are ordained for the salvation \nof all the faithful. But in the celebration of the other sacraments there \nis no common prayer put up for the salvation of all the faithful and of \nthe departed. Consequently it is unbecoming in this sacrament.",
        "OB4": "Further, Baptism especially is called the sacrament of faith. \nConsequently, the truths which belong to instruction in the faith ought \nrather to be given regarding Baptism than regarding this sacrament, such \nas the doctrine of the apostles and of the Gospels.",

Consequently, the devotion of the faithful ought not to \nbe stirred up in this sacrament more than in the others by Divine praises \nand by admonitions, such as, \"Lift up your hearts.\"\nObjection 6: Further, the minister of this sacrament is the priest, as stated \nabove (Question [82], Article [1]). Consequently, all the words spoken in this sacrament \nought to be uttered by the priest, and not some by the ministers, and \nsome by the choir.\nObjection 7: Further, the Divine power works this sacrament unfailingly. \nTherefore it is to no purpose that the priest asks for the perfecting of \nthis sacrament, saying: \"Which oblation do thou, O God, in all,\" etc.\nObjection 8: Further, the sacrifice of the New Law is much more excellent than \nthe sacrifice of the fathers of old. Therefore, it is unfitting for the \npriest to pray that this sacrifice may be as acceptable as the sacrifice \nof Abel, Abraham, and Melchisedech.\nObjection 9: Further, just as Christ's body does not begin to be in this \nsacrament by change of place, as stated above (Question [75], Article [2]), so likewise \nneither does it cease to be there. Consequently, it is improper for the \npriest to ask: \"Bid these things be borne by the hands of thy holy angel \nunto Thine altar on high.\"\nReply to  Greater devotion is required in this sacrament than in the \nothers, for the reason that the entire Christ is contained therein. \nMoreover, this sacrament requires a more general devotion, i.e. on the \npart of the whole people, since for them it is offered; and not merely on \nthe part of the recipients, as in the other sacraments. Hence Cyprian \nobserves (De Orat. Domin. 31), \"The priest, in saying the Preface, \ndisposes the souls of the brethren  by saying, 'Lift up your hearts,' and \nwhen the people answer---'We have lifted them up to the Lord,' let them \nremember that they are to think of nothing else but God.\"\nReply to Objection 6: As was said above (ad 3), those things are mentioned in \nthis sacrament which belong to the entire Church; and consequently some \nthings which refer to the people are sung by the choir, and same of these \nwords are all sung by the choir, as though inspiring the entire people \nwith them; and there are other words which the priest begins and the \npeople take up, the priest then acting as in the person of God; to show \nthat the things they denote have come to the people through Divine \nrevelation, such as faith and heavenly glory; and therefore the priest \nintones the \"Creed\" and the \"Gloria in excelsis Deo.\" Other words are \nuttered by the ministers, such as the doctrine of the Old and New \nTestament, as a sign that this doctrine was announced to the peoples \nthrough ministers sent by God. And there are other words which the priest \nalone recites, namely, such as belong to his personal office, \"that he \nmay offer up gifts and prayers for the people\" (Heb. 5:1). Some of these, \nhowever, he says aloud, namely, such as are common to priest and people \nalike, such as the \"common prayers\"; other words, however, belong to the \npriest alone, such as the oblation and the consecration; consequently, \nthe prayers that are said in connection with these have to be said by the \npriest in secret. Nevertheless, in both he calls the people to attention \nby saying: \"The Lord be with you,\" and he waits for them to assent by \nsaying \"Amen.\" And therefore before the secret prayers he says aloud, \n\"The Lord be with you,\" and he concludes, \"For ever and ever.\" Or the \npriest secretly pronounces some of the words as a token that regarding \nChrist's Passion the disciples acknowledged Him only in secret.\nReply to Objection 7: The efficacy of the sacramental words can be hindered by \nthe priest's intention. Nor is there anything unbecoming in our asking of \nGod for what we know He will do, just as Christ (Jn. 17:1,5) asked for \nHis glorification.\nBut the priest does not seem to pray there for the consecration to be \nfulfilled, but that it may be fruitful in our regard, hence he says \nexpressively: \"That it may become 'to us' the body and the blood.\" Again, \nthe words preceding these have that meaning, when he says: \"Vouchsafe to \nmake this oblation blessed,\" i.e. according to Augustine (Paschasius, De \nCorp. et Sang. Dom. xii), \"that we may receive a blessing,\" namely, \nthrough grace; \"'enrolled,' i.e. that we may be enrolled in heaven; \n'ratified,' i.e. that we may be incorporated in Christ; 'reasonable,' \ni.e. that we may be stripped of our animal sense; 'acceptable,' i.e. that \nwe who in ourselves are displeasing, may, by its means, be made \nacceptable to His only Son.\"\nReply to Objection 8: Although this sacrament is of itself preferable to all \nancient sacrifices, yet the sacrifices of the men of old were most \nacceptable to God on account of their devotion. Consequently the priest \nasks that this sacrifice may be accepted by God through the devotion of \nthe offerers, just as the former  sacrifices were accepted by Him.\nReply to Objection 9: The priest does not pray that the sacramental species may \nbe borne up to heaven; nor that Christ's true body may be borne thither, \nfor it does not cease to be there; but he offers this prayer for Christ's \nmystical body, which is signified in this sacrament, that the angel \nstanding by at the Divine mysteries may present to God the prayers of \nboth priest and people, according to Apoc. 8:4: \"And the smoke of the \nincense of the prayers of the saints ascended up before God, from the \nhand of the angel.\" But God's \"altar on high\" means either the Church \ntriumphant, unto which we pray to be translated, or else God Himself, in \nWhom we ask to share; because it is said of this altar (Ex. 20:26): \"Thou \nshalt not go up by steps unto My altar, i.e. thou shalt make no steps \ntowards the Trinity.\" Or else by the angel we are to understand Christ \nHimself, Who is the \"Angel of great counsel\" (Is. 9:6: Septuagint), Who \nunites His mystical body with God the Father and the Church triumphant.\nAnd from this the mass derives its name [missa]; because the priest \nsends [mittit] his prayers up to God through the angel, as the people do \nthrough the priest. or else because Christ is the victim sent [missa] to \nus: accordingly the deacon on festival days \"dismisses\" the people at the \nend of the mass, by saying: \"Ite, missa est,\" that is, the victim has \nbeen sent [missa est] to God through the angel, so that it may be \naccepted by God.",
        "CON": "We find it stated in De Consecr., dist. 1, that \"James, \nthe brother of the Lord according to the flesh, and Basil, bishop of \nCaesarea, edited the rite of celebrating the mass\": and from their \nauthority it is manifest that whatever words are employed in this matter, \nare chosen becomingly.",
        "ANS": "Since the whole mystery of our salvation is comprised in \nthis sacrament, therefore is it performed with greater solemnity than the \nother sacraments. And since it is written (Eccles. 4:17): \"Keep thy foot \nwhen thou goest into the house of God\"; and (Ecclus. 18:23): \"Before \nprayer prepare thy soul,\" therefore the celebration of this mystery is \npreceded by a certain preparation in order that we may perform worthily \nthat which  follows after. The first part of this preparation is Divine \npraise, and consists in the \"Introit\": according to Ps. 49:23: \"The \nsacrifice of praise shall glorify me; and there is the way by which I \nwill show him the salvation of God\": and this is taken for the most part \nfrom the Psalms, or, at least, is sung with a Psalm, because, as \nDionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii): \"The Psalms comprise by way of praise \nwhatever is contained in Sacred Scripture.\"\nThe second part contains a reference to our present misery, by reason of \nwhich we pray for mercy, saying: \"Lord, have mercy on us,\" thrice for the \nPerson of the Father, and \"Christ, have mercy on us,\" thrice for the \nPerson of the Son, and \"Lord, have mercy on us,\" thrice for the Person of \nthe Holy Ghost; against the threefold misery of ignorance, sin, and \npunishment; or else to express the \"circuminsession\" of all the Divine \nPersons.\nThe third part commemorates the heavenly glory, to the possession of \nwhich, after this life of misery, we are tending, in the words, \"Glory be \nto God on high,\" which are sung on festival days, on which the heavenly \nglory is commemorated, but are omitted in those sorrowful offices which \ncommemorate our unhappy state.\nThe fourth part contains the prayer which the priest makes for the \npeople, that they may be made worthy of such great mysteries.\nThere precedes, in the second place, the instruction of the faithful, \nbecause this sacrament is \"a mystery of faith,\" as stated above (Question [78], Article [3], ad 5). Now this instruction is given \"dispositively,\" when the \nLectors and Sub-deacons read aloud in the church the teachings of the \nprophets and apostles: after this \"lesson,\" the choir sing the \"Gradual,\" \nwhich signifies progress in life; then the \"Alleluia\" is intoned, and \nthis denotes spiritual joy; or in mournful offices the \"Tract\", \nexpressive of spiritual sighing; for all these things ought to result \nfrom the aforesaid teaching. But the people are instructed \"perfectly\" by \nChrist's teaching contained in the Gospel, which is read by the higher \nministers, that is, by the Deacons. And because we believe Christ as the \nDivine truth, according to Jn. 8:46, \"If I tell you the truth, why do you \nnot believe Me?\" after the Gospel has been read, the \"Creed\" is sung in \nwhich the people show that they assent by faith to Christ's doctrine. And \nit is sung on those festivals of which mention is made therein, as on the \nfestivals of Christ, of the Blessed Virgin, and of the apostles, who laid \nthe foundations of this faith, and on other such days.\nSo then, after the people have been prepared and instructed, the next \nstep is to proceed to the celebration of the mystery, which is both \noffered as a sacrifice, and consecrated and received as a sacrament: \nsince first we have the oblation; then the consecration of the matter \noffered; and thirdly, its reception.\nIn regard to the oblation, two things are done, namely, the people's \npraise in singing the \"offertory,\" expressing the joy of the offerers, \nand the priest's prayer asking for the people's  oblation to be made \nacceptable to God. Hence David said (1 Para 29:17): \"In the simplicity of \nmy heart, I have . . . offered all these things: and I have seen with \ngreat joy Thy people which are here present, offer Thee their offerings\": \nand then he makes the following prayer: \"O Lord God . . . keep . . . this \nwill.\"\nThen, regarding the consecration, performed by supernatural power, the \npeople are first of all excited to devotion in the \"Preface,\" hence they \nare admonished \"to lift up their hearts to the Lord,\" and therefore when \nthe \"Preface\" is ended the people devoutly praise Christ's Godhead, \nsaying with the angels: \"Holy, Holy, Holy\"; and His humanity, saying with \nthe children: \"Blessed is he that cometh.\" In the next place the priest \nmakes a \"commemoration,\" first of those for whom this sacrifice is \noffered, namely, for the whole Church, and \"for those set in high places\" \n(1 Tim. 2:2), and, in a special manner, of them \"who offer, or for whom \nthe mass is offered.\" Secondly, he commemorates the saints, invoking \ntheir patronage for those mentioned above, when he says: \"Communicating \nwith, and honoring the memory,\" etc. Thirdly, he concludes the petition \nwhen he says: \"Wherefore that this oblation,\" etc., in order that the \noblation may be salutary to them for whom it is offered.\nThen he comes to the consecration itself. Here he asks first of all for \nthe effect of the consecration, when he says: \"Which oblation do Thou, O \nGod,\" etc. Secondly, he performs the consecration using our Saviour's \nwords, when he says: \"Who the day before,\" etc. Thirdly, he makes excuse \nfor his presumption in obeying Christ's command, saying: \"Wherefore, \ncalling to mind,\" etc. Fourthly, he asks that the sacrifice accomplished \nmay find favor with God, when he says: \"Look down upon them with a \npropitious,\" etc. Fifthly, he begs for the effect of this sacrifice and \nsacrament, first for the partakers, saying: \"We humbly beseech Thee\"; \nthen for the dead, who can no longer receive it, saying: \"Be mindful \nalso, O Lord,\" etc.; thirdly, for the priests themselves who offer, \nsaying: \"And to us sinners,\" etc.\nThen follows the act of receiving the sacrament. First of all, the \npeople are prepared for Communion; first, by the common prayer of the \ncongregation, which is the Lord's Prayer, in which we ask for our daily \nbread to be given us; and also by private prayer, which the priest puts \nup specially for the people, when he says: \"Deliver us, we beseech Thee, \nO Lord,\" etc. Secondly, the people are prepared by the \"Pax\" which is \ngiven with the words, \"Lamb of God,\" etc., because this is the sacrament \nof unity and peace, as stated above (Question [73], Article [4]; Question [79], Article [1]). But in \nmasses for the dead, in which the sacrifice is offered not for present \npeace, but for the repose of the dead, the \"Pax\" is omitted.\nThen follows the reception of the sacrament, the priest receiving first, \nand afterwards giving it to others, because, as Dionysius says (Eccl. \nHier. iii), he who gives Divine things to others, ought first to partake \nthereof himself.\nFinally, the whole celebration of mass ends with the thanksgiving, the \npeople rejoicing for having received the mystery (and this is the meaning \nof the singing after the Communion); and the priest returning thanks by \nprayer, as Christ, at the close of the supper with His disciples, \"said a \nhymn\" (Mt. 26:30).",
        "RP1": "The consecration is accomplished by Christ's words only; \nbut the other words must be added to dispose the people for receiving it, \nas stated above.",
        "RP2": "As is stated in the last chapter of John (verse 25), our \nLord said and did many things which are not written down by the \nEvangelists; and among them is the uplifting of His eyes to heaven at the \nsupper; nevertheless the Roman Church had it by tradition from the \napostles. For it seems reasonable that He Who lifted up His eyes to the \nFather in raising Lazarus to life, as related in Jn. 11:41, and in the \nprayer which He made for the disciples (Jn. 17:1), had more reason to do \nso in instituting this sacrament, as being of greater import.\nThe use of the word \"manducate\" instead of \"comedite\" makes no \ndifference in the meaning, nor does the expression signify, especially \nsince those words are no part of the form, as stated above (Question [78], Article [1], ad 2,4).\nThe additional word \"all\" is understood in the Gospels, although not \nexpressed, because He had said (Jn. 6:54): \"Except you eat the flesh of \nthe Son of Man . . . you shall not have life in you.\"",
        "RP3": "The Eucharist is the sacrament of the unity of the whole \nChurch: and therefore in this sacrament, more than in the others, mention \nought to be made of all that belongs to the salvation of the entire \nChurch.",
        "RP4": "There is a twofold instruction in the Faith: the first is \nfor those receiving it for the first time, that is to say, for \ncatechumens, and such instruction is given in connection with Baptism. \nThe other is the instruction of the faithful who take part in this \nsacrament; and such instruction is given in connection with this \nsacrament. Nevertheless catechumens and unbelievers are not excluded \ntherefrom. Hence in De Consecr., dist. 1, it is laid down: \"Let the \nbishop hinder no one from entering the church, and hearing the word of \nGod, be they Gentiles, heretics, or Jews, until the mass of the \nCatechumens begins,\" in which the instruction regarding the Faith is \ncontained."

        "question": "Whether the actions performed in celebrating this sacrament are becoming?",
        "OB1": "It seems that the actions performed in celebrating this mystery \nare not becoming. For, as is evident from its form, this sacrament \nbelongs to the New Testament. But under the New Testament the ceremonies \nof the old are not to be observed, such as that the priests and ministers \nwere purified with water when they drew nigh to offer up the sacrifice: \nfor we read (Ex. 30:19,20): \"Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands \nand feet . . . when they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony . \n. . and when they are to come to the altar.\" Therefore it is not fitting \nthat the priest should wash his hands when celebrating mass.\n: Further, just as, in this sacrament, Christ's body is set before \nus as food, so is His blood, as drink. But in receiving Christ's body no \nother bodily food is added in the celebration of the mass. Therefore, it \nis out of place for the priest, after taking Christ's blood, to receive \nother wine which is not consecrated.\n: Further, the truth ought to be conformable with the figure. But \nregarding the Paschal Lamb, which was a figure of this sacrament, it was \ncommanded that nothing of it should \"remain until the morning.\" It is \nimproper therefore for consecrated hosts to be reserved, and not consumed \nat once.\n: Further, the priest addresses in the plural number those who are \nhearing mass, when he says, \"The Lord be with you\": and, \"Let us return \nthanks.\" But it is out of keeping to address one individual in the plural \nnumber, especially an inferior. Consequently it seems unfitting for a \npriest to say mass with only a single server present. Therefore in the \ncelebration of this sacrament it seems that some of the things done are \nout of place.",
        "OB2": "Further, (Ex. 30:7), the Lord commanded Aaron to \"burn \nsweet-smelling incense\" upon the altar which was \"before the \npropitiatory\": and the same action was part of the ceremonies of the Old \nLaw. Therefore it is not fitting for the priest to use incense during \nmass.",
        "OB3": "Further, the ceremonies performed in the sacraments of the Church \nought not to be repeated. Consequently it is not proper for the priest to \nrepeat the sign of the cross many times over this sacrament.",
        "OB4": "Further, the Apostle says (Heb. 7:7): \"And without all  \ncontradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.\" But Christ, \nWho is in this sacrament after the consecration, is much greater than the \npriest. Therefore quite unseemingly the priest, after the consecration, \nblesses this sacrament, by signing it with the cross.",
        "OB5": "Further, nothing which appears ridiculous ought to be done in one \nof the Church's sacraments. But it seems ridiculous to perform gestures, \ne.g. for the priest to stretch out his arms at times, to join his hands, \nto join together his fingers, and to bow down. Consequently, such things \nought not to be done in this sacrament.\nObjection 6: Further, it seems ridiculous for the priest to turn round \nfrequently towards the people, and often to greet the people. \nConsequently, such things ought not to be done in the celebration of this \nsacrament.\nObjection 7: Further, the Apostle (1 Cor. 13) deems it improper for Christ to \nbe divided. But Christ is in this sacrament after the consecration. \nTherefore it is not proper for the priest to divide the host.\nObjection 8: Further, the ceremonies performed in this sacrament represent \nChrist's Passion. But during the Passion Christ's body was divided in the \nplaces of the five wounds. Therefore Christ's body ought to be broken \ninto five parts rather than into three.\nObjection 9: Further, Christ's entire body is consecrated in this sacrament \napart from the blood. Consequently, it is not proper for a particle of \nthe body to be mixed with the blood.\nReply to  The actions performed by the priest in mass are not \nridiculous gestures, since they are done so as to represent something \nelse. The priest in extending his arms signifies the outstretching of \nChrist's arms upon the cross. He also lifts up his hands as he prays, to \npoint out that his prayer is directed to God for the people, according to \nLam. 3:41: \"Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the \nheavens\": and Ex. 17:11: \"And when Moses lifted up his hands Israel \novercame.\" That at times he joins his hands, and bows down, praying \nearnestly and humbly, denotes the humility and obedience of Christ, out \nof which He suffered. He closes his fingers, i.e. the thumb and first \nfinger, after the consecration, because, with them, he had touched the \nconsecrated body of Christ; so that if any particle cling to the fingers, \nit may not be scattered: and this belongs to the reverence for this \nsacrament.\nReply to Objection 6: Five times does the priest turn round towards the people, \nto denote that our Lord manifested Himself five times on the day of His \nResurrection, as stated above in the treatise on Christ's Resurrection \n(Question [55], Article [3], Objection [3]). But the priest greets the people seven times, \nnamely, five times, by turning round to the people, and twice without \nturning round, namely, when he says, \"The Lord be with you\" before the \n\"Preface,\" and again when he says, \"May the peace of the Lord be ever \nwith you\": and this is to denote the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost. \nBut a bishop, when he celebrates on festival days, in his first greeting \nsays, \"Peace be to you,\" which was our Lord's greeting after \nResurrection, Whose person the bishop chiefly represents.\nReply to Objection 7: The breaking of the host denotes three things: first, the \nrending of Christ's body, which took place in the Passion; secondly, the \ndistinction of His mystical body according to its various states; and \nthirdly, the distribution of the graces which flow from Christ's Passion, \nas Dionysius observes (Eccl. Hier. iii). Hence this breaking does not \nimply severance in Christ.\nReply to Objection 8: As Pope Sergius says, and it is to be found in the \nDecretals (De Consecr., dist. ii), \"the Lord's body is threefold; the \npart offered and put into the chalice signifies Christ's risen body,\" \nnamely, Christ Himself, and the Blessed Virgin, and the other saints, if \nthere be any, who are already in glory with their bodies. \"The part \nconsumed denotes those still walking upon earth,\" because while living \nupon earth they are  united together by this sacrament; and are bruised \nby the passions, just as the bread eaten is bruised by the teeth. \"The \npart reserved on the altar till the close of the mass, is His body hidden \nin the sepulchre, because the bodies of the saints will be in their \ngraves until the end of the world\": though their souls are either in \npurgatory, or in heaven. However, this rite of reserving one part on the \naltar till the close of the mass is no longer observed, on account of the \ndanger; nevertheless, the same meaning of the parts continues, which some \npersons have expressed in verse, thus:\n\"The host being rent---\nWhat is dipped, means the blest;\nWhat is dry, means the living;\nWhat is kept, those at rest.\"\nOthers, however, say that the part put into the chalice denotes those \nstill living in this world. while the part kept outside the chalice \ndenotes those fully blessed both in soul and body; while the part \nconsumed means the others.\nReply to Objection 9: Two things can be signified by the chalice: first, the \nPassion itself, which is represented in this sacrament, and according to \nthis, by the part put into the chalice are denoted those who are still \nsharers of Christ's sufferings; secondly, the enjoyment of the Blessed \ncan be signified, which is likewise foreshadowed in this sacrament; and \ntherefore those whose bodies are already in full beatitude, are denoted \nby the part put into the chalice. And it is to be observed that the part \nput into the chalice ought not to be given to the people to supplement \nthe communion, because Christ gave dipped bread only to Judas the \nbetrayer.",
        "CON": "The custom of the Church stands for these  things: and \nthe Church cannot err, since she is taught by the Holy Ghost.",
        "ANS": "As was said above (Question [60], Article [6]), there is a twofold \nmanner of signification in the sacraments, by words, and by actions, in \norder that the signification may thus be more perfect. Now, in the \ncelebration of this sacrament words are used to signify things pertaining \nto Christ's Passion, which is represented in this sacrament; or again, \npertaining to Christ's mystical body, which is signified therein; and \nagain, things pertaining to the use of this sacrament, which use ought to \nbe devout and reverent. Consequently, in the celebration of this mystery \nsome things are done in order to represent Christ's Passion, or the \ndisposing of His mystical body, and some others are done which pertain to \nthe devotion and reverence due to this sacrament.",
        "RP1": "The washing of the hands is done in the celebration of mass \nout of reverence for this sacrament; and this for two reasons: first, \nbecause we are not wont to handle precious objects except the hands be \nwashed; hence it seems indecent for anyone to approach so great a \nsacrament with hands that are, even literally, unclean. Secondly, on \naccount of its signification, because, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. \niii), the washing of the extremities of the limbs denotes cleansing from \neven the smallest sins, according to Jn. 13:10: \"He that is washed \nneedeth not but to wash his feet.\" And such cleansing is required of him \nwho approaches this sacrament; and this is denoted by the confession \nwhich is made before the \"Introit\" of the mass. Moreover, this was \nsignified by the washing of the priests under the Old Law, as Dionysius \nsays (Eccl. Hier. iii). However, the Church observes this ceremony, not \nbecause it was prescribed under the Old Law, but because it is becoming \nin itself, and therefore instituted by the Church. Hence it is not \nobserved in the same way as it was then: because the washing of the feet \nis omitted, and the washing of the hands is observed; for this can be \ndone more readily, and suffices far denoting perfect cleansing. For, \nsince the hand is the \"organ of organs\" (De Anima iii), all works are \nattributed to the hands: hence it is said in Ps. 25:6: \"I will wash my \nhands among the innocent.\"\n: Wine, by reason of its humidity, is capable of washing, \nconsequently it is received in order to rinse the mouth after receiving \nthis sacrament, lest any particles remain: and this belongs to reverence \nfor the sacrament. Hence (Extra, De Celebratione missae, chap. Ex parte), \nit is said: \"The priest should always cleanse his mouth with wine after \nreceiving the entire sacrament of Eucharist: except when he has to \ncelebrate another mass on the same day, lest from taking the \nablution-wine he be prevented from celebrating again\"; and it is for the \nsame reason that wine is poured over the fingers with which he had \ntouched the body of Christ.\n: The truth ought to be conformable with the figure, in some \nrespect: namely, because a part of the host consecrated, of which the \npriest and ministers or even the people communicate, ought not to be \nreserved until the day following. Hence, as is laid down (De Consecr., \ndist. ii), Pope Clement I ordered that \"as many hosts are to be offered \non the altar as shall suffice for the people; should any be left over, \nthey are not to be reserved until the morrow, but let the clergy \ncarefully consume them with fear and trembling.\" Nevertheless, since this \nsacrament  is to be received daily, whereas the Paschal Lamb was not, it \nis therefore necessary for other hosts to be reserved for the sick. Hence \nwe read in the same distinction: \"Let the priest always have the \nEucharist ready, so that, when anyone fall sick, he may take Communion to \nhim at once, lest he die without it.\"\n: Several persons ought to be present at the solemn \ncelebration of the mass. Hence Pope Soter says (De Consecr., dist. 1): \n\"It has also been ordained, that no priest is to presume to celebrate \nsolemn mass, unless two others be present answering him, while he himself \nmakes the third; because when he says in the plural, 'The Lord be with \nyou,' and again in the Secrets, 'Pray ye for me,' it is most becoming \nthat they should answer his greeting.\" Hence it is for the sake of \ngreater solemnity that we find it decreed (De Consecr. dist. 1) that a \nbishop is to solemnize mass with several assistants. Nevertheless, in \nprivate masses it suffices to have one server, who takes the place of the \nwhole Catholic people, on whose behalf he makes answer in the plural to \nthe priest.",
        "RP2": "We use incense, not as commanded by a ceremonial precept of \nthe Law, but as prescribed by the Church; accordingly we do not use it in \nthe same fashion as it was ordered under the Old Law. It has reference to \ntwo things: first, to the reverence due to this sacrament, i.e. in order \nby its good odor, to remove any disagreeable smell that may be about the \nplace; secondly, it serves to show the effect of grace, wherewith Christ \nwas filled as with a good odor, according to Gn. 27:27: \"Behold, the odor \nof my son is like the odor of a ripe field\"; and from Christ it spreads \nto the faithful by the work of His ministers, according to 2 Cor. 2:14: \n\"He manifesteth the odor of his knowledge by us in every place\"; and \ntherefore when the altar which represents Christ, has been incensed on \nevery side, then all are incensed in their proper order.",
        "RP3": "The priest, in celebrating the mass, makes use of the sign \nof the cross to signify Christ's Passion which was ended upon the cross. \nNow, Christ's Passion was accomplished in certain stages. First of all \nthere was Christ's betrayal, which was the work of God, of Judas, and of \nthe Jews; and this is signified by the triple sign of the cross at the \nwords, \"These gifts, these presents, these holy unspotted sacrifices.\"\nSecondly, there was the selling of Christ. Now he was sold to the \nPriests, to the Scribes, and to the Pharisees: and to signify this the \nthreefold sign of the cross is repeated, at the words, \"blessed, \nenrolled, ratified.\" Or again, to signify the price for which He was \nsold, viz. thirty pence. And a double cross is added at the words---\"that \nit may become to us the Body and the Blood,\" etc., to signify the person \nof Judas the seller, and of Christ Who was sold.\nThirdly, there was the foreshadowing of the Passion at the last supper. \nTo denote this, in the third place, two crosses are made, one in \nconsecrating the body, the other in consecrating the blood; each time \nwhile saying, \"He blessed.\"\nFourthly, there was Christ's Passion itself. And so in order to \nrepresent His five wounds, in the fourth place, there is a fivefold \nsigning of the cross at the words, \"a pure Victim, a holy Victim, a \nspotless Victim, the holy bread of eternal life, and the cup of \neverlasting salvation.\"\nFifthly, the outstretching of Christ's body, and the shedding of the \nblood, and the fruits of the Passion, are signified by the triple signing \nof the cross at the words, \"as many as shall receive the body and blood, \nmay be filled with every blessing,\" etc.\nSixthly, Christ's threefold prayer upon the cross is represented; one \nfor His persecutors when He said, \"Father, forgive them\"; the second for \ndeliverance from death, when He cried, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou \nforsaken Me?\" the third referring to His entrance into glory, when He \nsaid, \"Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit\"; and in order to \ndenote these there is a triple signing with the cross made at the words, \n\"Thou dost sanctify, quicken, bless.\"\nSeventhly, the three hours during which He hung upon the cross, that is, \nfrom the sixth to the ninth hour, are represented; in signification of \nwhich we make once more a triple sign of the cross at the words, \"Through \nHim, and with Him, and in Him.\"\nEighthly, the separation of His soul from the body is signified by the \ntwo subsequent crosses made over the chalice.\nNinthly, the resurrection on the third day is represented by the three \ncrosses made at the words---\"May the peace of the Lord be ever with you.\"\nIn short, we may say that the consecration of this sacrament, and the \nacceptance of this sacrifice, and its fruits, proceed from the virtue of \nthe cross of Christ, and therefore wherever mention is made of these, the \npriest makes use of the sign of the cross.",
        "RP4": "After the consecration, the priest makes the sign of the \ncross, not for the purpose of blessing and consecrating, but only for \ncalling to mind the virtue of the cross, and the manner of Christ's \nsuffering, as is evident from what has been said (ad 3)."

        "question": "Whether the defects occurring during the celebration of this sacrament can be sufficiently met by observing the Church's statutes?",
        "OB1": "It seems that the defects occurring during the celebration of \nthis sacrament cannot be sufficiently met by observing the statutes of \nthe Church. For it sometimes happens that before or after the \nconsecration the priest dies or goes mad, or is hindered by some other \ninfirmity from receiving the sacrament and completing the mass. \nConsequently it seems impossible to observe the Church's statute, whereby \nthe priest consecrating must communicate of his own sacrifice.",
        "OB2": "Further, it sometimes happens that, before the consecration, the \npriest remembers that he has eaten or drunk something, or that he is in \nmortal sin, or under excommunication, which he did not remember \npreviously. Therefore, in such a dilemma a man must necessarily commit \nmortal sin by acting against the Church's statute, whether he receives or \nnot.",
        "OB3": "Further, it sometimes happens that a fly or a spider, or some \nother poisonous creature falls into the chalice after the consecration. \nOr even that the priest comes to know that poison has been put in by some \nevilly disposed person in order to kill him. Now in this instance, if he \ntakes it, he appears to sin by killing himself, or by tempting God: also \nin like manner if he does not take it, he sins by acting against the \nChurch's statute. Consequently, he seems to be perplexed, and under \nnecessity of sinning, which is not becoming.",
        "OB4": "Further, it sometimes happens from the server's want of heed that \nwater is not added to the chalice, or even the wine overlooked, and that \nthe priest discovers this. Therefore he seems  to be perplexed likewise \nin this case, whether he receives the body without the blood, thus making \nthe sacrifice to be incomplete, or whether he receives neither the body \nnor the blood.",
        "OB5": "Further, it sometimes happens that the priest cannot remember \nhaving said the words of consecration, or other words which are uttered \nin the celebration of this sacrament. In this case he seems to sin, \nwhether he repeats the words over the same matter, which words possibly \nhe has said before, or whether he uses bread and wine which are not \nconsecrated, as if they were consecrated.\nObjection 6: Further, it sometimes comes to pass owing to the cold that the \nhost will slip from the priest's hands into the chalice, either before or \nafter the breaking. In this case then the priest will not be able to \ncomply with the Church's rite, either as to the breaking, or else as to \nthis, that only a third part is put into the chalice.\nObjection 7: Further, sometimes, too, it happens, owing to the priest's want \nof care, that Christ's blood is spilled, or that he vomits the sacrament \nreceived, or that the consecrated hosts are kept so long that they become \ncorrupt, or that they are nibbled by mice, or lost in any manner \nwhatsoever; in which cases it does not seem possible for due reverence to \nbe shown towards this sacrament, as the Church's ordinances require. It \ndoes not seem then that such defects or dangers can be met by keeping to \nthe Church's statutes.\nReply to  Although the priest may not recollect having said some of \nthe words he ought to say, he ought not to be disturbed mentally on that \naccount; for a man who utters many words cannot recall to mind all that \nhe has said; unless perchance in uttering them he adverts to something \nconnected with the consecration; for so it is impressed on the memory. \nHence, if a man pays attention to what he is saying, but without \nadverting to the fact that he is saying these particular words, he \nremembers soon after that he has said them; for, a thing is presented to \nthe memory under the formality of the past (De Mem. et Remin. i).\nBut if it seem to the priest that he has probably omitted some of the \nwords that are not necessary for the sacrament, I think that he ought not \nto repeat them on that account, changing the order of the sacrifice, but \nthat he ought to proceed: but if he is certain that he has left out any \nof those that are necessary for the sacrament, namely, the form of the \nconsecration, since the form of the consecration is necessary for the \nsacrament, just as the matter is, it seems that the same thing ought to \nbe done as was stated above (ad 4) with regard to defect in the matter, \nnamely, that he should begin again with the form of the consecration, and \nrepeat the other things in order, lest the order of the sacrifice be \naltered.\nReply to Objection 6: The breaking of the consecrated host, and the putting of \nonly one part into the chalice, regards the mystical body, just as the \nmixing with water signifies the people, and therefore the omission of \neither of them causes no such imperfection in the sacrifice, as calls for \nrepetition regarding the celebration of this sacrament.\nReply to Objection 7: According to the decree, De Consecr., dist. ii, quoting a \ndecree of Pope Pius I, \"If from neglect any of the blood falls upon a \nboard which is fixed to the ground, let it be taken up with the tongue, \nand let the board be scraped. But if it be not a board, let the ground be \nscraped, and the scrapings burned, and the ashes buried inside the altar \nand let the priest do penance for forty days. But if a drop fall from the \nchalice on to the altar, let the minister suck up the drop, and do \npenance during three days; if it falls upon the altar cloth and \npenetrates to the second altar cloth, let him do four days' penance; if \nit penetrates to the third, let him do nine days' penance; if to the \nfourth, let him do twenty days' penance; and let the altar linens which \nthe drop touched be washed three times by the priest, holding the chalice \nbelow, then let the water be taken and put away nigh to the altar.\" It \nmight even be drunk by the minister, unless it might be rejected from \nnausea. Some persons go further, and cut out that part of the linen, \nwhich they burn, putting the ashes in the altar or down the sacrarium. \nAnd the Decretal continues with a quotation from the Penitential of Bede \nthe Priest: \"If, owing to drunkenness or gluttony, anyone vomits up the \nEucharist, let him do forty days' penance, if he be a layman; but let \nclerics or monks, deacons and priests, do seventy days' penance; and let \na bishop do ninety days'. But if they vomit from sickness, let them do \npenance for seven days.\" And in the same distinction, we read a decree of \nthe (Fourth) Council of Arles: \"They who do not keep proper custody over \nthe sacrament, if a mouse or other animal consume it, must do forty days' \npenance: he who loses it in a church, or if a part fall and be not found, \nshall do thirty days' penance.\" And the priest seems to deserve the same \npenance, who from neglect allows the hosts to putrefy. And on those days \nthe one doing penance ought to fast, and abstain from Communion. However, \nafter weighing the circumstances of the fact and of the person, the said \npenances may be lessened or increased. But it must be observed that \nwherever the species are found to be entire, they must be preserved \nreverently, or consumed; because Christ's body is there so long as the \nspecies last, as stated above (Question [77], Articles [4],5). But if it can be done \nconveniently, the things in which they are found are to be burned, and \nthe ashes put in the sacrarium, as was said of the scrapings of the \naltar-table, here above.",
        "CON": "Just as God does not command an impossibility, so \nneither does the Church.",
        "ANS": "Dangers or defects happening to this sacrament can be met \nin two ways: first, by preventing any such mishaps from occurring: \nsecondly, by dealing with them in such a way, that what may have happened \namiss is put right, either by employing a remedy, or at least by \nrepentance on his part who has acted negligently regarding this sacrament.",
        "RP1": "If the priest be stricken by death or grave sickness before \nthe consecration of our Lord's body and blood, there is no need for it to \nbe completed by another. But if this happens after the consecration is \nbegun, for instance, when the body has been consecrated and before the \nconsecration of the blood, or even after both have been consecrated, then \nthe celebration of the mass ought to be finished by someone else. Hence, \nas is laid down (Decretal vii, q. 1), we read the following decree of the \n(Seventh) Council of Toledo: \"We consider it to be fitting that when the \nsacred mysteries are consecrated by priests during the time of mass, if \nany sickness supervenes, in consequence of which they cannot finish the \nmystery begun, let it be free for the bishop or another priest to finish \nthe consecration of the office thus begun. For nothing else is suitable \nfor completing the mysteries commenced, unless the consecration be \ncompleted either by the priest who began it, or by the one who follows \nhim: because they  cannot be completed except they be performed in \nperfect order. For since we are all one in Christ, the change of persons \nmakes no difference, since unity of faith insures the happy issue of the \nmystery. Yet let not the course we propose for cases of natural debility, \nbe presumptuously abused: and let no minister or priest presume ever to \nleave the Divine offices unfinished, unless he be absolutely prevented \nfrom continuing. If anyone shall have rashly presumed to do so, he will \nincur sentence of excommunication.\"",
        "RP2": "Where difficulty arises, the less dangerous course should \nalways be followed. But the greatest danger regarding this sacrament lies \nin whatever may prevent its completion, because this is a heinous \nsacrilege; while that danger is of less account which regards the \ncondition of the receiver. Consequently, if after the consecration has \nbeen begun the priest remembers that he has eaten or drunk anything, he \nought nevertheless to complete the sacrifice and receive the sacrament. \nLikewise, if he recalls a sin committed, he ought to make an act of \ncontrition, with the firm purpose of confessing and making satisfaction \nfor it: and thus he will not receive the sacrament unworthily, but with \nprofit. The same applies if he calls to mind that he is under some \nexcommunication; for he ought to make the resolution of humbly seeking \nabsolution; and so he will receive absolution from the invisible High \nPriest Jesus Christ for his act of completing the Divine mysteries.\nBut if he calls to mind any of the above facts previous to the \nconsecration, I should deem it safer for him to interrupt the mass begun, \nespecially if he has broken his fast, or is under excommunication, unless \ngrave scandal were to be feared.",
        "RP3": "If a fly or a spider falls into the chalice before \nconsecration, or if it be discovered that the wine is poisoned, it ought \nto be poured out, and after purifying the chalice, fresh wine should be \nserved for consecration. But if anything of the sort happen after the \nconsecration, the insect should be caught carefully and washed \nthoroughly, then burned, and the \"ablution,\" together with the ashes, \nthrown into the sacrarium. If it be discovered that the wine has been \npoisoned, the priest should neither receive it nor administer it to \nothers on any account, lest the life-giving chalice become one of death, \nbut it ought to be kept in a suitable vessel with the relics: and in \norder that the sacrament may not remain incomplete, he ought to put other \nwine into the chalice, resume the mass from the consecration of the \nblood, and complete the sacrifice.",
        "RP4": "If before the consecration of the blood, and after the \nconsecration of the body the priest detect that either the wine or the \nwater is absent, then he ought at once to add them and consecrate. But if \nafter the words of consecration he discover that the water is absent, he \nought notwithstanding to proceed straight on, because the addition of the \nwater is not necessary for the sacrament, as stated above (Question [74], Article [7]): \nnevertheless the person responsible for the neglect ought to be punished. \nAnd on no account  should water be mixed with the consecrated wine, \nbecause corruption of the sacrament would ensue in part, as was said \nabove (Question [77], Article [8]). But if after the words of consecration the priest \nperceive that no wine has been put in the chalice, and if he detect it \nbefore receiving the body, then rejecting the water, he ought to pour in \nwine with water, and begin over again the consecrating words of the \nblood. But if he notice it after receiving the body, he ought to procure \nanother host which must be consecrated together with the blood; and I say \nso for this reason, because if he were to say only the words of \nconsecration of the blood, the proper order of consecrating would not be \nobserved; and, as is laid down by the Council of Toledo, quoted above (ad \n1), sacrifices cannot be perfect, except they be performed in perfect \norder. But if he were to begin from the consecration of the blood, and \nwere to repeat all the words which follow, it would not suffice, unless \nthere was a consecrated host present, since in those words there are \nthings to be said and done not only regarding the blood, but also \nregarding the body; and at the close he ought once more to receive the \nconsecrated host and blood, even if he had already taken the water which \nwas in the chalice, because the precept of the completing this sacrament \nis of greater weight than the precept of receiving the sacrament while \nfasting, as stated above (Question [80], Article [8])."
