        "question": "Whether it belongs to man to act for an end?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that it does not belong to man to act for an end. \nFor a cause is naturally first. But an end, in its very name, implies \nsomething that is last. Therefore an end is not a cause. But that for \nwhich a man acts, is the cause of his action; since this preposition \n\"for\" indicates a relation of causality. Therefore it does not belong to \nman to act for an end.",
        "OB2": "Further, that which is itself the last end is not for an end. But \nin some cases the last end is an action, as the Philosopher states \n(Ethic. i, 1). Therefore man does not do everything for an end.",
        "OB3": "Further, then does a man seem to act for an end, when he acts \ndeliberately. But man does many things without deliberation, sometimes \nnot even thinking of what he is doing; for instance when one moves one's \nfoot or hand, or scratches one's  beard, while intent on something else. \nTherefore man does not do everything for an end.",
        "CON": "All things contained in a genus are derived from the \nprinciple of that genus. Now the end is the principle in human \noperations, as the Philosopher states (Phys. ii, 9). Therefore it belongs \nto man to do everything for an end.",
        "ANS": "Of actions done by man those alone are properly called \n\"human,\" which are proper to man as man. Now man differs from irrational \nanimals in this, that he is master of his actions. Wherefore those \nactions alone are properly called human, of which man is master. Now man \nis master of his actions through his reason and will; whence, too, the \nfree-will is defined as \"the faculty and will of reason.\" Therefore those \nactions are properly called human which proceed from a deliberate will. \nAnd if any other actions are found in man, they can be called actions \"of \na man,\" but not properly \"human\" actions, since they are not proper to \nman as man. Now it is clear that whatever actions proceed from a power, \nare caused by that power in accordance with the nature of its object. But \nthe object of the will is the end and the good. Therefore all human \nactions must be for an end.",
        "RP1": "Although the end be last in the order of execution, yet it \nis first in the order of the agent's intention. And it is this way that \nit is a cause.",
        "RP2": "If any human action be the last end, it must be voluntary, \nelse it would not be human, as stated above. Now an action is voluntary \nin one of two ways: first, because it is commanded by the will, e.g. to \nwalk, or to speak; secondly, because it is elicited by the will, for \ninstance the very act of willing. Now it is impossible for the very act \nelicited by the will to be the last end. For the object of the will is \nthe end, just as the object of sight is color: wherefore just as the \nfirst visible cannot be the act of seeing, because every act of seeing is \ndirected to a visible object; so the first appetible, i.e. the end, \ncannot be the very act of willing. Consequently it follows that if a \nhuman action be the last end, it must be an action commanded by the will: \nso that there, some action of man, at least the act of willing, is for \nthe end. Therefore whatever a man does, it is true to say that man acts \nfor an end, even when he does that action in which the last end consists.",
        "RP3": "Such like actions are not properly human actions; since \nthey do not proceed from deliberation of the reason, which is the proper \nprinciple of human actions. Therefore they have indeed an imaginary end, \nbut not one that is fixed by reason."

        "question": "Whether it is proper to the rational nature to act for an end?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that it is proper to the rational nature to act for \nan end. For man, to whom it belongs to act for an end,  never acts for an \nunknown end. On the other hand, there are many things that have no \nknowledge of an end; either because they are altogether without \nknowledge, as insensible creatures: or because they do not apprehend the \nidea of an end as such, as irrational animals. Therefore it seems proper \nto the rational nature to act for an end.",
        "OB2": "Further, to act for an end is to order one's action to an end. \nBut this is the work of reason. Therefore it does not belong to things \nthat lack reason.",
        "OB3": "Further, the good and the end is the object of the will. But \"the \nwill is in the reason\" (De Anima iii, 9). Therefore to act for an end \nbelongs to none but a rational nature.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher proves (Phys. ii, 5) that \"not only \nmind but also nature acts for an end.\"",
        "ANS": "Every agent, of necessity, acts for an end. For if, in a \nnumber of causes ordained to one another, the first be removed, the \nothers must, of necessity, be removed also. Now the first of all causes \nis the final cause. The reason of which is that matter does not receive \nform, save in so far as it is moved by an agent; for nothing reduces \nitself from potentiality to act. But an agent does not move except out of \nintention for an end. For if the agent were not determinate to some \nparticular effect, it would not do one thing rather than another: \nconsequently in order that it produce a determinate effect, it must, of \nnecessity, be determined to some certain one, which has the nature of an \nend. And just as this determination is effected, in the rational nature, \nby the \"rational appetite,\" which is called the will; so, in other \nthings, it is caused by their natural inclination, which is called the \n\"natural appetite.\"\nNevertheless it must be observed that a thing tends to an end, by its \naction or movement, in two ways: first, as a thing, moving itself to the \nend, as man; secondly, as a thing moved by another to the end, as an \narrow tends to a determinate end through being moved by the archer who \ndirects his action to the end. Therefore those things that are possessed \nof reason, move themselves to an end; because they have dominion over \ntheir actions through their free-will, which is the \"faculty of will and \nreason.\" But those things that lack reason tend to an end, by natural \ninclination, as being moved by another and not by themselves; since they \ndo not know the nature of an end as such, and consequently cannot ordain \nanything to an end, but can be ordained to an end only by another. For \nthe entire irrational nature is in comparison to God as an instrument to \nthe principal agent, as stated above (FP, Question [22], Article [2], ad 4; FP, Question [103], Article [1], ad 3). Consequently it is proper to the rational nature to tend to \nan end, as directing [agens] and leading itself to the end: whereas it is \nproper to the irrational nature to tend to an end, as directed or led by \nanother, whether it apprehend the end, as do irrational animals, or do \nnot apprehend it, as is the case of those things which are altogether \nvoid of knowledge.",
        "RP1": "When a man of himself acts for an end, he knows the end: \nbut when he is directed or led by another, for instance, when he acts at \nanother's command, or when he is moved under another's compulsion, it is \nnot necessary that he should know the end. And it is thus with irrational \ncreatures.",
        "RP2": "To ordain towards an end belongs to that which directs \nitself to an end: whereas to be ordained to an end belongs to that which \nis directed by another to an end. And this can belong to an irrational \nnature, but owing to some one possessed of reason.",
        "RP3": "The object of the will is the end and the good in \nuniversal. Consequently there can be no will in those things that lack \nreason and intellect, since they cannot apprehend the universal; but they \nhave a natural appetite or a sensitive appetite, determinate to some \nparticular good. Now it is clear that particular causes are moved by a \nuniversal cause: thus the governor of a city, who intends the common \ngood, moves, by his command, all the particular departments of the city. \nConsequently all things that lack reason are, of necessity, moved to \ntheir particular ends by some rational will which extends to the \nuniversal good, namely by the Divine will."

        "question": "Whether human acts are specified by their end?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that human acts are not specified by their end. For \nthe end is an extrinsic cause. But everything is specified by an \nintrinsic principle. Therefore human acts are not specified by their end.",
        "OB2": "Further, that which gives a thing its species should exist before \nit. But the end comes into existence afterwards. Therefore a human act \ndoes not derive its species from the end.",
        "OB3": "Further, one thing cannot be in more than one species. But one \nand the same act may happen to be ordained to various ends. Therefore the \nend does not give the species to human acts.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Mor. Eccl. et Manich. ii, 13): \n\"According as their end is worthy of blame or praise so are our deeds \nworthy of blame or praise.\"\nI answer that Each thing receives its species in respect of an act and \nnot in respect of potentiality; wherefore things composed of matter and \nform are established in their respective species by their own forms. And \nthis is also to be observed in proper movements. For since movements are, \nin a way, divided into action and passion, each of these receives its \nspecies from an act; action indeed from the act which is the principle of \nacting, and passion from the act which is the terminus of the movement. \nWherefore heating, as an action, is nothing else than a certain movement \nproceeding from heat, while heating as a passion is nothing else  than a \nmovement towards heat: and it is the definition that shows the specific \nnature. And either way, human acts, whether they be considered as \nactions, or as passions, receive their species from the end. For human \nacts can be considered in both ways, since man moves himself, and is \nmoved by himself. Now it has been stated above (Article [1]) that acts are \ncalled human, inasmuch as they proceed from a deliberate will. Now the \nobject of the will is the good and the end. And hence it is clear that \nthe principle of human acts, in so far as they are human, is the end. In \nlike manner it is their terminus: for the human act terminates at that \nwhich the will intends as the end; thus in natural agents the form of the \nthing generated is conformed to the form of the generator. And since, as \nAmbrose says (Prolog. super Luc.) \"morality is said properly of man,\" \nmoral acts properly speaking receive their species from the end, for \nmoral acts are the same as human acts.",
        "RP1": "The end is not altogether extrinsic to the act, because it \nis related to the act as principle or terminus; and thus it just this \nthat is essential to an act, viz. to proceed from something, considered \nas action, and to proceed towards something, considered as passion.",
        "RP2": "The end, in so far as it pre-exists in the intention, \npertains to the will, as stated above (Article [1], ad 1). And it is thus that \nit gives the species to the human or moral act.",
        "RP3": "One and the same act, in so far as it proceeds once from \nthe agent, is ordained to but one proximate end, from which it has its \nspecies: but it can be ordained to several remote ends, of which one is \nthe end of the other. It is possible, however, that an act which is one \nin respect of its natural species, be ordained to several ends of the \nwill: thus this act \"to kill a man,\" which is but one act in respect of \nits natural species, can be ordained, as to an end, to the safeguarding \nof justice, and to the satisfying of anger: the result being that there \nwould be several acts in different species of morality: since in one way \nthere will be an act of virtue, in another, an act of vice. For a \nmovement does not receive its species from that which is its terminus \naccidentally, but only from that which is its \"per se\" terminus. Now \nmoral ends are accidental to a natural thing, and conversely the relation \nto a natural end is accidental to morality. Consequently there is no \nreason why acts which are the same considered in their natural species, \nshould not be diverse, considered in their moral species, and conversely."

        "question": "Whether there is one last end of human life?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that there is no last end of human life, but that \nwe proceed to infinity. For good is essentially diffusive, as Dionysius \nstates (Div. Nom. iv). Consequently if that which proceeds from good is \nitself good, the latter must needs diffuse some other good: so that the \ndiffusion of good goes on indefinitely. But good has the nature of an \nend. Therefore there is  an indefinite series of ends.",
        "OB2": "Further, things pertaining to the reason can be multiplied to \ninfinity: thus mathematical quantities have no limit. For the same reason \nthe species of numbers are infinite, since, given any number, the reason \ncan think of one yet greater. But desire of the end is consequent on the \napprehension of the reason. Therefore it seems that there is also an \ninfinite series of ends.",
        "OB3": "Further, the good and the end is the object of the will. But the \nwill can react on itself an infinite number of times: for I can will \nsomething, and will to will it, and so on indefinitely. Therefore there \nis an infinite series of ends of the human will, and there is no last end \nof the human will.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher says (Metaph. ii, 2) that \"to suppose a \nthing to be indefinite is to deny that it is good.\" But the good is that \nwhich has the nature of an end. Therefore it is contrary to the nature of \nan end to proceed indefinitely. Therefore it is necessary to fix one last \nend.",
        "ANS": "Absolutely speaking, it is not possible to proceed \nindefinitely in the matter of ends, from any point of view. For in \nwhatsoever things there is an essential order of one to another, if the \nfirst be removed, those that are ordained to the first, must of necessity \nbe removed also. Wherefore the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 5) that we \ncannot proceed to infinitude in causes of movement, because then there \nwould be no first mover, without which neither can the others move, since \nthey move only through being moved by the first mover. Now there is to be \nobserved a twofold order in ends---the order of intention and the order \nof execution: and in either of these orders there must be something \nfirst. For that which is first in the order of intention, is the \nprinciple, as it were, moving the appetite; consequently, if you remove \nthis principle, there will be nothing to move the appetite. On the other \nhand, the principle in execution is that wherein operation has its \nbeginning; and if this principle be taken away, no one will begin to \nwork. Now the principle in the intention is the last end; while the \nprinciple in execution is the first of the things which are ordained to \nthe end. Consequently, on neither side is it possible to go to infinity \nsince if there were no last end, nothing would be desired, nor would any \naction have its term, nor would the intention of the agent be at rest; \nwhile if there is no first thing among those that are ordained to the \nend, none would begin to work at anything, and counsel would have no \nterm, but would continue indefinitely.\nOn the other hand, nothing hinders infinity from being in things that \nare ordained to one another not essentially but accidentally; for \naccidental causes are indeterminate. And in this way it happens that \nthere is an accidental infinity of ends, and of things ordained to the \nend.",
        "RP1": "The very nature of good is that something flows  from it, \nbut not that it flows from something else. Since, therefore, good has the \nnature of end, and the first good is the last end, this argument does not \nprove that there is no last end; but that from the end, already supposed, \nwe may proceed downwards indefinitely towards those things that are \nordained to the end. And this would be true if we considered but the \npower of the First Good, which is infinite. But, since the First Good \ndiffuses itself according to the intellect, to which it is proper to flow \nforth into its effects according to a certain fixed form; it follows that \nthere is a certain measure to the flow of good things from the First Good \nfrom Which all other goods share the power of diffusion. Consequently the \ndiffusion of goods does not proceed indefinitely but, as it is written \n(Wis. 11:21), God disposes all things \"in number, weight and measure.\"",
        "RP2": "In things which are of themselves, reason begins from \nprinciples that are known naturally, and advances to some term. Wherefore \nthe Philosopher proves (Poster. i, 3) that there is no infinite process \nin demonstrations, because there we find a process of things having an \nessential, not an accidental, connection with one another. But in those \nthings which are accidentally connected, nothing hinders the reason from \nproceeding indefinitely. Now it is accidental to a stated quantity or \nnumber, as such, that quantity or unity be added to it. Wherefore in such \nlike things nothing hinders the reason from an indefinite process.",
        "RP3": "This multiplication of acts of the will reacting on itself, \nis accidental to the order of ends. This is clear from the fact that in \nregard to one and the same end, the will reacts on itself indifferently \nonce or several times."

        "question": "Whether one man can have several last ends?",
        "OB1": "It would seem possible for one man's will to be directed at the \nsame time to several things, as last ends. For Augustine says (De Civ. \nDei xix, 1) that some held man's last end to consist in four things, viz. \n\"in pleasure, repose, the gifts of nature, and virtue.\" But these are \nclearly more than one thing. Therefore one man can place the last end of \nhis will in many things.",
        "OB2": "Further, things not in opposition to one another do not exclude \none another. Now there are many things which are not in opposition to one \nanother. Therefore the supposition that one thing is the last end of the \nwill does not exclude others.",
        "OB3": "Further, by the fact that it places its last end in one thing, \nthe will does not lose its freedom. But before it placed its last end in \nthat thing, e.g. pleasure, it could place it in something else, e.g. \nriches. Therefore even after having placed his last end in pleasure, a \nman can at the same time place his last end in riches. Therefore it is \npossible for one man's will to be directed at the same time to several \nthings, as last ends.",
        "CON": "That in which a man rests as in his last end, is master \nof his affections, since he takes therefrom his entire rule of life. \nHence of gluttons it is written (Phil. 3:19): \"Whose god is their belly\": \nviz. because they place their last end in the pleasures of the belly. Now \naccording to Mt. 6:24, \"No man can serve two masters,\" such, namely, as \nare not ordained to one another. Therefore it is impossible for one man \nto have several last ends not ordained to one another.",
        "ANS": "It is impossible for one man's will to be directed at the \nsame time to diverse things, as last ends. Three reasons may be assigned \nfor this. First, because, since everything desires its own perfection, a \nman desires for his ultimate end, that which he desires as his perfect \nand crowning good. Hence Augustine (De Civ. Dei xix, 1): \"In speaking of \nthe end of good we mean now, not that it passes away so as to be no more, \nbut that it is perfected so as to be complete.\" It is therefore necessary \nfor the last end so to fill man's appetite, that nothing is left besides \nit for man to desire. Which is not possible, if something else be \nrequired for his perfection. Consequently it is not possible for the \nappetite so to tend to two things, as though each were its perfect good.\nThe second reason is because, just as in the process of reasoning, the \nprinciple is that which is naturally known, so in the process of the \nrational appetite, i.e. the will, the principle needs to be that which is \nnaturally desired. Now this must needs be one: since nature tends to one \nthing only. But the principle in the process of the rational appetite is \nthe last end. Therefore that to which the will tends, as to its last end, \nis one.\nThe third reason is because, since voluntary actions receive their \nspecies from the end, as stated above (Article [3]), they must needs receive \ntheir genus from the last end, which is common to them all: just as \nnatural things are placed in a genus according to a common form. Since, \nthen, all things that can be desired by the will, belong, as such, to one \ngenus, the last end must needs be one. And all the more because in every \ngenus there is one first principle; and the last end has the nature of a \nfirst principle, as stated above. Now as the last end of man, simply as \nman, is to the whole human race, so is the last end of any individual man \nto that individual. Therefore, just as of all men there is naturally one \nlast end, so the will of an individual man must be fixed on one last end.",
        "RP1": "All these several objects were considered as one perfect \ngood resulting therefrom, by those who placed in them the last end.",
        "RP2": "Although it is possible to find several things which are \nnot in opposition to one another, yet it is contrary to a thing's perfect \ngood, that anything besides be required for that thing's perfection.",

      {
        "question": "Whether man will all, whatsoever he wills, for the last end?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that man does not will all, whatsoever he wills, \nfor the last end. For things ordained to the last end are said to be \nserious matter, as being useful. But jests are foreign to serious matter. \nTherefore what man does in jest, he ordains not to the last end.",
        "OB2": "Further, the Philosopher says at the beginning of his Metaphysics \n1,[2] that speculative science is sought for its own sake. Now it cannot \nbe said that each speculative science is the last end. Therefore man does \nnot desire all, whatsoever he desires, for the last end.",
        "OB3": "Further, whosoever ordains something to an end, thinks of that \nend. But man does not always think of the last end in all that he desires \nor does. Therefore man neither desires nor does all for the last end.",
        "CON": "Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 1): \"That is the end \nof our good, for the sake of which we love other things, whereas we love \nit for its own sake.\"",
        "ANS": "Man must, of necessity, desire all, whatsoever he \ndesires, for the last end. This is evident for two reasons. First, \nbecause whatever man desires, he desires it under the aspect of good. And \nif he desire it, not as his perfect good, which is the last end, he must, \nof necessity, desire it as tending to the perfect good, because the \nbeginning of anything is always ordained to its completion; as is clearly \nthe case in effects both of nature and of art. Wherefore every beginning \nof perfection is ordained to complete perfection which is achieved \nthrough the last end. Secondly, because the last end stands in the same \nrelation in moving the appetite, as the first mover in other movements. \nNow it is clear that secondary moving causes do not move save inasmuch as \nthey are moved by the first mover. Therefore secondary objects of the \nappetite do not move the appetite, except as ordained to the first object \nof the appetite, which is the last end.",
        "RP1": "Actions done jestingly are not directed to any external \nend; but merely to the good of the jester, in so far as they afford him \npleasure or relaxation. But man's consummate good is his last end.",
        "RP2": "The same applies to speculative science; which is desired \nas the scientist's good, included in complete and perfect good, which is \nthe ultimate end.",
        "RP3": "One need not always be thinking of the last end, whenever \none desires or does something: but the virtue of the first intention, \nwhich was in respect of the last end, remains in every desire directed to \nany object whatever, even though one's thoughts be not actually directed \nto the last end.

So, then, as to the aspect \nof last end, all agree in desiring the last end: since all desire the \nfulfilment of their perfection, and it is precisely this fulfilment in \nwhich the last end consists, as stated above (Article [5]). But as to the thing \nin which this aspect is realized, all men are not agreed as to their last \nend: since some desire riches as their consummate good; some, pleasure; \nothers, something else. Thus to every taste the sweet is pleasant but to \nsome, the sweetness of wine is most pleasant, to others, the sweetness of \nhoney, or of something similar. Yet that sweet is absolutely the best of \nall pleasant things, in which he who has the best taste takes most \npleasure.

If, however, we speak of man's \nlast end, as of the acquisition of the end, then irrational creatures do \nnot concur with man in this end. For man and other rational creatures \nattain to their last end by knowing and loving God: this is not possible \nto other creatures, which acquire their last end, in so far as they share \nin the Divine likeness, inasmuch as they are, or live, or even know.\nHence it is evident how the objections are solved: since happiness means \nthe acquisition of the last end."

We \nmust therefore consider that every delight is a proper accident resulting \nfrom happiness, or from some part of happiness; since the reason that a \nman is delighted is that he has some fitting good, either in reality, or \nin hope, or at least in memory. Now a fitting good, if indeed it be the \nperfect good, is precisely man's happiness: and if it is imperfect, it is \na share of happiness, either proximate, or remote, or at least apparent. \nTherefore it is evident that neither is delight, which results from the \nperfect good, the very essence of happiness, but something resulting \ntherefrom as its proper accident.\nBut bodily pleasure cannot result from the perfect good even in that \nway. For it results from a good apprehended by sense, which is a power of \nthe soul, which power makes use of the body. Now good pertaining to the \nbody, and apprehended by sense, cannot be man's perfect good. For since \nthe rational soul excels the capacity of corporeal matter, that part of \nthe soul which is independent of a corporeal organ, has a certain \ninfinity in regard to the body and those parts of the soul which are tied \ndown to the body: just as immaterial things are in a way infinite as \ncompared to material things, since a form is, after a fashion, contracted \nand bounded by matter, so that a form which is independent of matter is, \nin a way, infinite. Therefore sense, which is a power of the body, knows \nthe singular, which is determinate through matter: whereas the intellect, \nwhich is a power independent of matter, knows the universal, which is \nabstracted from matter, and contains an infinite number of singulars. \nConsequently it is evident that good  which is fitting to the body, and \nwhich causes bodily delight through being apprehended by sense, is not \nman's perfect good, but is quite a trifle as compared with the good of \nthe soul.

In the happy angels, \nthe final perfection is in respect of some operation, by which they are \nunited to the Uncreated Good: and this operation of theirs is one only \nand everlasting. But in men, according to their present state of life, \nthe final perfection is in respect of an operation whereby man is united \nto God: but this operation neither can be continual, nor, consequently, \nis it one only, because operation is multiplied by being discontinued. \nAnd for this reason in the present state of life, perfect happiness \ncannot be attained by man. Wherefore the Philosopher, in placing man's \nhappiness in this life (Ethic. i, 10), says that it is imperfect, and \nafter a long discussion, concludes: \"We call men happy, but only as men.\" \nBut God has promised us perfect happiness, when we shall be \"as the \nangels . . . in heaven\" (Mt. 22:30).\nConsequently in regard to this perfect happiness, the objection fails: \nbecause in that state of happiness, man's mind will be united to God by \none, continual, everlasting operation. But in the present life, in as far \nas we fall short of the unity and continuity of that operation so do we \nfall short of perfect happiness. Nevertheless it is a participation of \nhappiness: and so much the greater, as the operation can be more \ncontinuous and more one. Consequently the active life, which is busy with \nmany things, has less of happiness than the contemplative life, which is \nbusied with one thing, i.e. the contemplation of truth. And if at any \ntime man is not actually engaged in this operation, yet since he can \nalways easily turn to it, and since he ordains the very cessation, by \nsleeping or occupying himself otherwise, to the aforesaid occupation, the \nlatter seems, as it were, continuous.

For it is evident from what has been \nsaid (Articles [1],2; Question [2], Article [7]) that happiness is the attainment of the last \nend.

For the will is directed to the end, both absent, when it \ndesires it; and present, when it is delighted by resting therein. Now it \nis evident that the desire itself of the end is not the attainment of the \nend, but is a movement towards the end: while delight comes to the will \nfrom the end being present; and not conversely, is a thing made present, \nby the fact that the will delights in it. Therefore, that the end be \npresent to him who desires it, must be due to something else than an act \nof the will.\nThis is evidently the case in regard to sensible ends.

Thus perfect prudence is in man, \nwith whom is the idea of things to be done; while imperfect prudence is \nin certain irrational animals, who are possessed of certain particular \ninstincts in respect of works similar to works of prudence.\nAccordingly perfect happiness cannot consist essentially in the \nconsideration of speculative sciences.

Now \nthe object of the intellect is \"what a thing is,\" i.e. the essence of a \nthing, according to De Anima  iii, 6.

And the operation of the intellect in \nthis life cannot be without a phantasm, which is only in a bodily organ, \nas was shown in the FP, Question [84], Articles [6],7.

And this is shown to be false, both by \nauthority and by reason. By authority, since the Apostle says (2 Cor. 5:6): \"While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord\"; and he \npoints out the reason of this absence, saying: \"For we walk by faith and \nnot by sight.\" Now from this it is clear that so long as we walk by faith \nand not by sight, bereft of the vision of the Divine Essence, we are not \npresent to the Lord. But the souls of the saints, separated from their \nbodies, are in God's presence; wherefore the text continues: \"But we are \nconfident and have a good will to be absent . . . from the body, and to \nbe present with the Lord.\" Whence it is evident that the souls of the \nsaints, separated from their bodies, \"walk by sight,\" seeing the Essence \nof God, wherein is true Happiness.\nAgain this is made clear by reason. For the intellect needs not the \nbody, for its operation, save on account of the phantasms, wherein it \nlooks on the intelligible truth, as stated in the FP, Question [84], Article [7]. Now it \nis evident that the Divine Essence cannot be seen by means of phantasms, \nas stated in the FP, Question [12], Article [3].

First, as constituting the essence thereof; thus \nthe soul is necessary for man's perfection. Secondly, as necessary for \nits well-being: thus, beauty of body and keenness of perfection belong to \nman's perfection. Wherefore though the body does not belong in the first \nway to the perfection of human Happiness, yet it does in the second way. \nFor since operation depends on a thing's nature, the more perfect is the \nsoul in its nature, the more perfectly it has its proper operation, \nwherein its happiness consists. Hence, Augustine, after inquiring (Gen. \nad lit. xii, 35) \"whether that perfect Happiness can be ascribed to the \nsouls of the dead separated from their bodies,\" answers \"that they cannot \nsee the Unchangeable Substance, as the blessed angels see It; either for \nsome other more hidden reason, or because they have a natural desire to \nrule the body.\"",

But the \nhuman soul retains the being of the composite after the destruction of \nthe body: and this because the being of the form is the same as that of \nits matter, and this is the being of the composite. Now the soul subsists \nin its own being, as stated in the FP, Question [75], Article [2].

Antecedently, because, as Augustine says (Gen. ad \nlit. xii, 35), \"if body be such, that the governance thereof is difficult \nand burdensome, like unto flesh which is corruptible and weighs upon the \nsoul, the mind is turned away from that vision of the highest heaven.\" \nWhence he concludes that, \"when this body will no longer be 'natural,' \nbut 'spiritual,' then will it be equalled to the angels, and that will be \nits glory, which erstwhile was its burden.\" Consequently, because from \nthe Happiness of the soul there will be an overflow on to the body, so \nthat this too will obtain its perfection.

        "ANS": "If we speak of imperfect happiness, such as can be had in \nthis life, in this sense it can be lost. This is clear of contemplative \nhappiness, which is lost either by forgetfulness, for instance, when \nknowledge is lost through sickness; or again by  certain occupations, \nwhereby a man is altogether withdrawn from contemplation.\nThis is also clear of active happiness: since man's will can be changed \nso as to fall to vice from the virtue, in whose act that happiness \nprincipally consists. If, however, the virtue remain unimpaired, outward \nchanges can indeed disturb such like happiness, in so far as they hinder \nmany acts of virtue; but they cannot take it away altogether because \nthere still remains an act of virtue, whereby man bears these trials in a \npraiseworthy manner. And since the happiness of this life can be lost, a \ncircumstance that appears to be contrary to the nature of happiness, \ntherefore did the Philosopher state (Ethic. i, 10) that some are happy in \nthis life, not simply, but \"as men,\" whose nature is subject to change.\nBut if we speak of that perfect Happiness which we await after this \nlife, it must be observed that Origen (Peri Archon. ii, 3), following the \nerror of certain Platonists, held that man can become unhappy after the \nfinal Happiness.\nThis, however, is evidently false, for two reasons. First, from the \ngeneral notion of happiness. For since happiness is the \"perfect and \nsufficient good,\" it must needs set man's desire at rest and exclude \nevery evil. Now man naturally desires to hold to the good that he has, \nand to have the surety of his holding: else he must of necessity be \ntroubled with the fear of losing it, or with the sorrow of knowing that \nhe will lose it. Therefore it is necessary for true Happiness that man \nhave the assured opinion of never losing the good that he possesses. If \nthis opinion be true, it follows that he never will lose happiness: but \nif it be false, it is in itself an evil that he should have a false \nopinion: because the false is the evil of the intellect, just as the true \nis its good, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2. Consequently he will no longer be \ntruly happy, if evil be in him.\nSecondly, it is again evident if we consider the specific nature of \nHappiness. For it has been shown above (Question [3], Article [8]) that man's perfect \nHappiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now it is \nimpossible for anyone seeing the Divine Essence, to wish not to see It. \nBecause every good that one possesses and yet wishes to be without, is \neither insufficient, something more sufficing being desired in its stead; \nor else has some inconvenience attached to it, by reason of which it \nbecomes wearisome. But the vision of the Divine Essence fills the soul \nwith all good things, since it unites it to the source of all goodness; \nhence it is written (Ps. 16:15): \"I shall be satisfied when Thy glory \nshall appear\"; and (Wis. 7:11): \"All good things came to me together with \nher,\" i.e. with the contemplation of wisdom. In like manner neither has \nit any inconvenience attached to it; because it is written of the \ncontemplation of wisdom (Wis. 8:16): \"Her conversation hath no \nbitterness, nor her company any tediousness.\" It is thus evident that the \nhappy man cannot forsake Happiness of his own accord. Moreover, neither \ncan he lose Happiness, through God taking it away from him. Because, \nsince the withdrawal of  Happiness is a punishment, it cannot be enforced \nby God, the just Judge, except for some fault; and he that sees God \ncannot fall into a fault, since rectitude of the will, of necessity, \nresults from that vision as was shown above (Question [4], Article [4]). Nor again can \nit be withdrawn by any other agent. Because the mind that is united to \nGod is raised above all other things: and consequently no other agent can \nsever the mind from that union. Therefore it seems unreasonable that as \ntime goes on, man should pass from happiness to misery, and vice versa; \nbecause such like vicissitudes of time can only be for such things as are \nsubject to time and movement.",

But the principle of human \nacts is not in man himself, but outside him: since man's appetite is \nmoved to act, by the appetible object which is outside him, and is as a \n\"mover unmoved\" (De Anima iii, 10). Therefore there is nothing voluntary \nin human acts.",

        "ANS": "There must needs be something voluntary in human acts. In \norder to make this clear, we must take note that the principle of some \nacts or movements is within the agent, or that which is moved; whereas \nthe principle of some movements or acts is outside. For when a stone is \nmoved upwards, the principle of this movement is outside the stone: \nwhereas when it is moved downwards, the principle of this movement is in \nthe stone. Now of those things that are moved by an intrinsic principle, \nsome move themselves, some not. For since every agent or thing moved, \nacts or is moved for an end, as stated above (Question [1], Article [2]); those are \nperfectly moved by an intrinsic principle, whose intrinsic principle is \none not only of movement but of movement for an end. Now in order for a \nthing to be done for an end, some knowledge of the end is necessary. \nTherefore, whatever so acts or is moved by an intrinsic principle, that \nit has some knowledge of the end, has within itself the principle of its \nact, so that it not only acts, but acts for an end. On the other hand, if \na thing has no knowledge of the end, even though it have an intrinsic \nprinciple of action or movement, nevertheless the principle of acting or \nbeing moved for an end is  not in that thing, but in something else, by \nwhich the principle of its action towards an end is not in that thing, \nbut in something else, by which the principle of its action towards an \nend is imprinted on it. Wherefore such like things are not said to move \nthemselves, but to be moved by others. But those things which have a \nknowledge of the end are said to move themselves because there is in them \na principle by which they not only act but also act for an end. And \nconsequently, since both are from an intrinsic principle, to wit, that \nthey act and that they act for an end, the movements of such things are \nsaid to be voluntary: for the word \"voluntary\" implies that their \nmovements and acts are from their own inclination. Hence it is that, \naccording to the definitions of Aristotle, Gregory of Nyssa, and \nDamascene [*See Objection 1], the voluntary is defined not only as having \n\"a principle within\" the agent, but also as implying \"knowledge.\" \nTherefore, since man especially knows the end of his work, and moves \nhimself, in his acts especially is the voluntary to be found.",

Yet again it must be \nobserved that a principle of movement may happen to be first in a genus, \nbut not first simply: thus in the genus of things subject to alteration, \nthe first principle of alteration is a heavenly body, which is \nnevertheless, is not the first mover simply, but is moved locally by a \nhigher mover. And so the intrinsic principle of the voluntary act, i.e. \nthe cognitive and appetitive power, is the first principle in the genus \nof appetitive movement, although it is moved by an extrinsic principle \naccording to other species of movement.",

First, in so far as by means of \nan extrinsic motion an animal's senses are confronted with something \nsensible, which, on being apprehended, moves the appetite. Thus a lion, \non seeing a stag in movement and coming towards him, begins to be moved \ntowards the stag. Secondly, in so far as some extrinsic motion produces a \nphysical change in an animal's body, as in the case of cold or heat; and \nthrough the body being affected by the motion of an outward body, the \nsensitive appetite which is the power of a bodily organ, is also moved \nindirectly; thus it happens that through some alteration in the body the \nappetite is roused to the desire of something. But this is not contrary \nto the nature of voluntariness, as stated above (ad 1), for such \nmovements caused by an extrinsic principle are of another genus of \nmovement.",

For a thing is said to be simply, according as it \nis in act; but according as it is only in apprehension, it is not simply, \nbut in a certain respect. Now that which is done through fear, is in act \nin so far as it is done. For, since acts are concerned with singulars; \nand the singular, as such, is here and now; that which is done is in act, \nin so far as it is here and now and under other individuating \ncircumstances.

And hence it is that what is done out of fear is essentially \nvoluntary, because its principle is within. But if we consider what is \ndone through fear, as outside this particular case, and inasmuch as it is \nrepugnant to the will, this is merely a consideration of the mind.

For the conditions of a voluntary act are satisfied, if it be \ndone on account of something else voluntary: since the voluntary is not \nonly what we wish, for its own sake, as an end, but also what we wish for \nthe sake of something else, as an end. It is clear therefore that in what \nis done from compulsion, the will does nothing inwardly; whereas in what \nis done through fear, the will does something. Accordingly, as Gregory of \nNyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat.

But it is not every \nignorance that deprives one of this knowledge. Accordingly, we must take \nnote that ignorance has a threefold relationship to the act of the will: \nin one way, \"concomitantly\"; in another, \"consequently\"; in a third way, \n\"antecedently.\" \"Concomitantly,\" when there is ignorance of what is done; \nbut, so that even if it were known, it would be done. For then, ignorance \ndoes not induce one to wish this to be done, but it just happens that a \nthing is at the same time done, and not known: thus in the example given \n(OBJ 3) a man did indeed wish to kill his foe, but killed him in \nignorance, thinking to kill a stag. And ignorance of this kind, as the \nPhilosopher states (Ethic. iii, 1), does not  cause involuntariness, \nsince it is not the cause of anything that is repugnant to the will: but \nit causes \"non-voluntariness,\" since that which is unknown cannot be \nactually willed. Ignorance is \"consequent\" to the act of the will, in so \nfar as ignorance itself is voluntary: and this happens in two ways, in \naccordance with the two aforesaid modes of voluntary (Article [3]). First, \nbecause the act of the will is brought to bear on the ignorance: as when \na man wishes not to know, that he may have an excuse for sin, or that he \nmay not be withheld from sin; according to Job 21:14: \"We desire not the \nknowledge of Thy ways.\" And this is called \"affected ignorance.\" \nSecondly, ignorance is said to be voluntary, when it regards that which \none can and ought to know: for in this sense \"not to act\" and \"not to \nwill\" are said to be voluntary, as stated above (Article [3]). And ignorance of \nthis kind happens, either when one does not actually consider what one \ncan and ought to consider; this is called \"ignorance of evil choice,\" and \narises from some passion or habit: or when one does not take the trouble \nto acquire the knowledge which one ought to have; in which sense, \nignorance of the general principles of law, which one to know, is \nvoluntary, as being due to negligence. Accordingly, if in either of these \nways, ignorance is voluntary, it cannot cause involuntariness simply. \nNevertheless it causes involuntariness in a certain respect, inasmuch as \nit precedes the movement of the will towards the act, which movement \nwould not be, if there were knowledge. Ignorance is \"antecedent\" to the \nact of the will, when it is not voluntary, and yet is the cause of man's \nwilling what he would not will otherwise. Thus a man may be ignorant of \nsome circumstance of his act, which he was not bound to know, the result \nbeing that he does that which he would not do, if he knew of that \ncircumstance; for instance, a man, after taking proper precaution, may \nnot know that someone is coming along the road, so that he shoots an \narrow and slays a passer-by. Such ignorance causes involuntariness simply.\nFrom this may be gathered the solution of the objections. For the first \nobjection deals with ignorance of what a man is bound to know. The \nsecond, with ignorance of choice, which is voluntary to a certain extent, \nas stated above. The third, with that ignorance which is concomitant with \nthe act of the will."

But this is impossible. For the \"will,\" as \nstated in De Anima iii, 9, \"is in the reason.\" Now the reason is a power \nof the soul, not bound to a bodily organ: wherefore it follows that the \nwill is a power absolutely incorporeal and immaterial. But it is evident \nthat no body can act on what is incorporeal, but rather the reverse: \nbecause things incorporeal and immaterial have a power more formal and \nmore universal than any corporeal things whatever. Therefore it is \nimpossible for a heavenly body to act directly on the intellect or will. \nFor this reason Aristotle (De Anima iii, 3) ascribed to those who held \nthat intellect differs not from sense, the theory that \"such is the will \nof men, as is the day which the father of men and of gods bring on\" \n[*Odyssey xviii. 135] (referring to Jupiter, by whom they understand the \nentire heavens). For all the sensitive powers, since they are acts of \nbodily organs, can be moved accidentally, by the heavenly bodies, i.e. \nthrough those bodies being moved, whose acts they are.\nBut since it has been stated (Article [2]) that the intellectual appetite is \nmoved, in a fashion, by the sensitive appetite, the movements of the \nheavenly bodies have an indirect bearing on the will; in so far as the \nwill happens to be moved by the passions of the sensitive appetite.",

But this \nmovement of the will is on the part of the object offered from without: \nnot on the part of an inward instigation.",
        "RP3": "As stated above (Cf. FP, Question [84], Articles [6],7) the sensitive \nappetite is the act of a bodily organ. Wherefore there is no reason why \nman should not be prone to anger or concupiscence, or some like passion, \nby reason of the influence of heavenly bodies,  just as by reason of his \nnatural complexion. But the majority of men are led by the passions, \nwhich the wise alone resist. Consequently, in the majority of cases \npredictions about human acts, gathered from the observation of heavenly \nbodies, are fulfilled. Nevertheless, as Ptolemy says (Centiloquium v), \n\"the wise man governs the stars\"; which is a though to say that by \nresisting his passions, he opposes his will, which is free and nowise \nsubject to the movement of the heavens, to such like effects of the \nheavenly bodies.\nOr, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 15): \"We must confess that when \nthe truth is foretold by astrologers, this is due to some most hidden \ninspiration, to which the human mind is subject without knowing it. And \nsince this is done in order to deceive man, it must be the work of the \nlying spirits.\""

Now although it is possible for something to move a \nnatural thing, without being the cause of the thing moved, yet that \nalone, which is in some way the cause of a thing's nature, can cause a \nnatural movement in that thing. For a stone is moved upwards by a man, \nwho is not the cause of the stone's nature, but this movement is not \nnatural to the stone; but the natural movement of the stone is caused by \nno other than the cause of its nature. Wherefore it is said in Phys. vii, \n4, that the generator moves locally heavy and light things. Accordingly \nman endowed with a will is sometimes moved by something that is not his \ncause; but that his voluntary movement be from an exterior  principle \nthat is not the cause of his will, is impossible.\nNow the cause of the will can be none other than God.

For \nsometimes it stands for the intrinsic principle in movable things. In \nthis sense nature is either matter or the material form, as stated in \nPhys. ii, 1. In another sense nature stands for any substance, or even \nfor any being. And in this sense, that is said to be natural to a thing \nwhich befits it in respect of its substance. And this is that which of \nitself is in a thing. Now all things that do not of themselves belong to \nthe thing in which they are, are reduced to something which belongs of \nitself to that thing, as to their principle. Wherefore, taking nature in \nthis sense, it is necessary that the principle of whatever belongs to a \nthing, be a natural principle. This is evident in regard to the \nintellect: for the principles of intellectual knowledge are naturally \nknown. In like manner the principle of voluntary movements must be \nsomething naturally willed.\nNow this is good in general, to which the will tends naturally, as does \neach power to its object; and again it is the last end, which stands in \nthe same relation to things appetible, as the first principles of \ndemonstrations to things intelligible: and, speaking generally, it is all \nthose things which belong to the willer according to his nature. For it \nis not only things pertaining to the will that the will desires, but also \nthat which pertains to each power, and to the entire man. Wherefore man \nwills naturally not only the object of the will, but also other things \nthat are appropriate to the other powers; such as the knowledge of truth, \nwhich befits the intellect; and to be and to live and other like things \nwhich regard the natural well-being; all of which are included in the \nobject of the will, as so many particular goods.",

There is, however, another manner of causing that is proper \nto the will, which is mistress of its act, besides the manner proper to \nnature, which is determinate to one thing. But since the will is founded \non some nature, it is necessary that the movement proper to nature be \nshared by the will, to some extent: just as what belongs to a previous \ncause is shared by a subsequent cause. Because in every thing, being \nitself, which is from nature, precedes volition, which is from the will. \nAnd hence it is that the will wills something naturally.",

Now movement is \"the act of that which is \nin potentiality\" (Aristotle, Phys. iii, 1). Wherefore that which belongs \nto, or results from, movement, in regard to natural things, is not always \nin them. Thus fire does not always move upwards, but only when it is \noutside its own place. [*The Aristotelian theory was that fire's proper \nplace is the fiery heaven, i.e. the Empyrean.] And in like manner it is \nnot necessary that the will (which is reduced from potentiality to act, \nwhen it wills something), should always be in the act of volition; but \nonly when it is in a certain determinate disposition.

Since, \ntherefore, the will is an immaterial power like the intellect, some one \ngeneral thing corresponds to it, naturally which is the good; just as to \nthe intellect there corresponds some one general thing, which is the \ntrue, or being, or \"what a thing is.\" And under good in general are \nincluded many particular goods, to none of which is the will determined."

But as to the second manner \nof motion, the will is moved by one object necessarily, by another not. \nFor in the movement of a power by its object, we must consider under what \naspect the object moves the power. For the visible moves the sight, under \nthe aspect of color actually visible.

If, on the other hand, the will is offered an object that is \nnot good from every point of view, it will not tend to it of necessity. \nAnd since lack of any good whatever, is a non-good, consequently, that \ngood alone which is perfect and lacking in nothing, is such a good that \nthe will cannot not-will it: and this is Happiness. Whereas any other \nparticular goods, in so far as they are lacking in some good, can be \nregarded as non-goods: and from this point of view, they can be set aside \nor approved by the will, which can tend to one and the same thing from \nvarious points of view.",

And that which has something delightful about \nit, to which a number of preceding things are referred, may indeed by \ncalled fruit in a certain manner; but we cannot be said to enjoy it \nproperly or as though it answered perfectly to the notion of fruit.

The same may be seen in the movements \nof clocks and all engines put together by the art of man. Now as \nartificial things are in comparison to human art, so are all natural \nthings in comparison to the Divine art. And accordingly order is to be \nseen in things moved by nature, just as in things moved by reason, as is \nstated in Phys. ii. And thus it is that in the works of irrational \nanimals we notice certain marks of sagacity, in so far as they have a \nnatural inclination to set about their actions in a most orderly manner \nthrough being ordained by the Supreme art. For which reason, too, certain \nanimals are called prudent or sagacious; and not because they reason or \nexercise any choice about things. This is clear from the fact that all \nthat share in one nature, invariably act in the same way."

Now the reason can intimate or declare something in two ways. \nFirst, absolutely: and this intimation is expressed by a verb in the \nindicative mood, as when one person says to another: \"This is what you \nshould do.\" Sometimes, however, the reason intimates something to a man \nby moving him thereto; and this intimation is expressed by a verb in the \nimperative mood; as when it is said to someone: \"Do this.\" Now the first \nmover, among the powers of the soul, to the doing of an act is the will, \nas stated above (Question [9], Article [1]).

Now it \nmust be observed that the sensitive appetite differs from the \nintellective appetite, which is called the will, in the fact that the \nsensitive appetite is a power of a corporeal organ, whereas the will is \nnot. Again, every act of a power that uses a corporeal organ, depends not \nonly on a power of the soul, but also on the disposition of that \ncorporeal organ: thus the act of vision depends on the power of sight, \nand on the condition of the eye, which condition is a help or a hindrance \nto that act.

These members \nare stirred at the occasion of some apprehension; in so far as the \nintellect and imagination represent such things as arouse the passions of \nthe soul, of which passions these movements are a consequence. But they \nare not moved at the command of the reason or intellect, because these \nmovements are conditioned by a certain natural change of heat and cold, \nwhich change is not subject to the command of reason. This is the case \nwith these two organs in particular, because each is as it were a \nseparate animal being, in so far as it is a principle of life; and the \nprinciple is virtually the whole.

Secondly, specific \nindifference of an action may be due to the fact that as far as its \nspecies is concerned, it is neither good nor bad. Wherefore it can be \nmade good or bad by something else.

And they say that if reason or conscience tell us to do \nsomething which is good generically, there is no error: and in like \nmanner if it tell us not to do something which is evil generically; since \nit is the same reason that prescribes what is good and forbids what is \nevil. On the other hand if a man's reason or conscience tells him that he \nis bound by precept to do what is evil in itself; or that what is good in \nitself, is forbidden, then his reason or conscience errs. In like manner \nif a man's reason or conscience tell him, that what is indifferent in \nitself, for instance to raise a straw from the ground, is forbidden or \ncommanded, his reason or conscience errs. They say, therefore, that \nreason or conscience when erring in matters of indifference, either by \ncommanding or by forbidding them, binds: so that the will which is at \nvariance with that erring reason is evil and sinful. But they say that \nwhen reason or conscience errs in commanding what is evil in itself, or \nin forbidding what is good in itself and necessary for salvation, it does \nnot bind; wherefore in such cases the will which is at variance with \nerring reason or conscience is not evil.\nBut this is unreasonable. For in matters of indifference, the will that \nis at variance with erring reason or conscience, is evil in some way on \naccount of the object, on which the goodness or malice of the will \ndepends; not indeed on account of the object according as it is in its \nown nature; but according as it is accidentally apprehended by reason as \nsomething evil to do or to avoid. And since the object of the will is \nthat which is proposed by the reason, as stated above (Article [3]), from the \nvery fact that a thing is proposed by the reason as being evil, the will \nby tending thereto becomes evil. And this is the case not only in \nindifferent matters, but also in those that are good or evil in \nthemselves. For not only indifferent matters can received the character \nof goodness or malice accidentally; but also that which is good, can \nreceive the character of evil, or that which is evil, can receive the \ncharacter of goodness, on account of the reason apprehending it as such. \nFor instance, to refrain from fornication is good: yet the will does not \ntend to this good except in so far as it is proposed by the reason. If, \ntherefore, the erring reason propose it as an evil, the will tends to it \nas to something evil. Consequently the will is evil, because it wills \nevil, not indeed that which is evil in itself, but that which is evil \naccidentally, through being apprehended as such by the reason. In like \nmanner, to believe in Christ is good in itself, and necessary for \nsalvation: but the will does not tend thereto, except inasmuch as it is \nproposed by the reason. Consequently if it be proposed by the reason as \nsomething evil, the will tends to it as to something evil: not as if it \nwere  evil in itself, but because it is evil accidentally, through the \napprehension of the reason. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 9) \nthat \"properly speaking the incontinent man is one who does not follow \nright reason; but accidentally, he is also one who does not follow false \nreason.\" We must therefore conclude that, absolutely speaking, every will \nat variance with reason, whether right or erring, is always evil.",

With regard to the external act this \nmay happen in two ways. First, through the object that is ordained to the \nintended end not being proportionate to that end; for instance, if a man \nwere to give ten pounds, he could not realize his intention, if he \nintended to buy a thing worth a hundred pounds. Secondly, on account of \nthe obstacles that may supervene in regard to the exterior action, which \nobstacles we are unable to remove: for instance, a man intends to go to \nRome, and encounters obstacles, which prevent him from going. On the \nother hand, with regard to the interior act of the will, this happens in \nonly one way: because the interior acts of the will are in our power, \nwhereas the external actions are not. But the will can will an object \nthat is not proportionate to the intended end: and thus the will that \ntends to that object considered absolutely, is not so good as the \nintention.

And yet it does \nnot follow that he wills or acts intensely; because the quantity of \ngoodness in the interior or exterior act does not depend on the quantity \nof the good intended, as is shown above.

And therefore if a man's will wills a thing to be, according as it \nappears to be good, his will is good: and the will of another man, who \nwills that thing not to be, according as it appears evil, is also good. \nThus a judge has a good will, in willing a thief to be put to death, \nbecause this is just: while the will of another---e.g. the thief's wife \nor son, who wishes him not to be put to death, inasmuch as killing is a \nnatural evil, is also good.\nNow since the will follows the apprehension of the reason or intellect; \nthe more universal the aspect of the apprehended good, the more universal \nthe good to which the will tends. This is evident in the example given \nabove: because the judge has care of the common good, which is justice, \nand therefore he wishes the thief's death, which has the aspect of good \nin relation to the common estate; whereas the thief's wife has to \nconsider the private, the good of the family, and from this point of view \nshe wishes her husband, the thief, not to be put to death. Now the good \nof the whole universe is that which is apprehended by God, Who is the \nMaker and Governor of all things: hence whatever He wills, He wills it \nunder the aspect of the common good; this is His own Goodness, which is \nthe good of the whole universe. On the other hand, the apprehension of a \ncreature, according to its nature, is of some particular good, \nproportionate to that nature. Now a thing may happen to be good under a \nparticular aspect, and yet not good under a universal aspect, or vice \nversa, as stated above. And therefore it comes to pass that a certain \nwill is good from willing something considered under a particular aspect, \nwhich thing God wills not, under a universal aspect, and vice versa. And \nhence too it is, that various wills of various men can be good in respect \nof opposite things, for as much as, under various aspects, they wish a \nparticular thing to be or not to be.\nBut a man's will is not right in willing a particular good, unless he \nrefer it to the common good as an end: since even the natural appetite of \neach part is ordained to the common good of the whole.

Because inasmuch as it is conformed to \nthe Divine will in the common aspect of the thing willed, it is conformed \nthereto in the point of the last end. While, inasmuch as it is not \nconformed to the Divine will in the thing willed materially, it is \nconformed to that will considered as  efficient cause; since the proper \ninclination consequent to nature, or to the particular apprehension of \nsome particular thing, comes to a thing from God as its efficient cause. \nHence it is customary to say that a man's will, in this respect, is \nconformed to the Divine will, because it wills what God wishes him to \nwill.\nThere is yet another kind of conformity in respect of the formal cause, \nconsisting in man's willing something from charity, as God wills it.

Since therefore sin is \na departure from the order to the end, as stated above (Article [1]), sin may \noccur in two ways, in a production of art. First, by a departure from the \nparticular end intended by the artist: and this sin will be proper to the \nart; for instance, if an artist produce a bad thing, while intending to \nproduce something good; or produce something good, while intending to \nproduce something bad. Secondly, by a departure from the general end of \nhuman life: and then he will be said to sin, if he intend to produce a \nbad work, and does so in effect, so that another is taken in thereby. But \nthis sin is not proper to the artist as such, but as man. Consequently \nfor the former sin the artist is blamed as an artist; while for the \nlatter he is blamed as a man. On the other hand, in moral matters, where \nwe take into consideration the order of reason to the general end of \nhuman life, sin and evil are always due to a departure from the order of \nreason to the general end of human life.

        "ANS": "The word \"passive\" is used in three ways. First, in a \ngeneral way, according as whatever receives something is passive, \nalthough nothing is taken from it: thus we may say that the air is \npassive when it is lit up. But this is to be perfected rather than to be \npassive. Secondly, the word \"passive\" is employed in its proper sense, \nwhen something is received, while something else is taken away: and this \nhappens in two ways. For sometimes that which is lost is unsuitable to \nthe thing: thus when an animal's body is healed, and loses sickness. At \nother times the contrary occurs: thus to ail is to be passive; because \nthe ailment is received and health is lost. And here we have passion in \nits most proper acceptation. For a thing is said to be passive from its \nbeing drawn to the agent: and when a thing recedes from what is suitable \nto it, then especially does it appear to be drawn to something else. \nMoreover in De Generat. i, 3 it is stated that when a more excellent \nthing is generated from a less excellent, we have generation simply, and \ncorruption in a particular respect: whereas the reverse is the case, when \nfrom a more excellent thing, a less excellent is generated. In these \nthree ways it happens that passions are in the soul. For in the sense of \nmere reception, we speak of \"feeling and understanding as being a kind of \npassion\" (De Anima i, 5). But passion, accompanied by the loss of \nsomething, is only in respect of a bodily transmutation; wherefore \npassion properly so called cannot be in the soul, save accidentally, in \nso far, to wit, as the \"composite\" is passive. But here again we find a \ndifference; because when this transmutation is for the worse, it has more \nof the nature of a passion, than when it is for the better: hence sorrow \nis more properly a passion than joy.",

Now, though the soul is not composed of matter and form, \nyet it has something of potentiality, in respect of which it is competent \nto receive or to be passive, according as the act of understanding is a \nkind of passion, as stated in De Anima iii, 4.",

But in things \nthat relate to defect, intensity depends, not on approach to something \nsupreme, but in receding from that which is perfect; because therein \nconsists the very notion of privation and defect. Wherefore the less a \nthing recedes from that which stands first, the less intense it is: and \nthe result is that at first we always find some small defect, which \nafterwards increases as it goes on. Now passion pertains to defect, \nbecause it belongs to a thing according as it is in potentiality. \nWherefore in those things that approach to the Supreme Perfection, i.e. \nto God, there is but little potentiality and passion: while in other \nthings, consequently, there is more.

But the organs are receptive of another and natural change, which \naffects their natural disposition; for instance, when they become hot or \ncold, or undergo some similar change.

Much \nmore, therefore, do the passions of different faculties differ in \nspecies; since a greater difference in the object is required to \ndiversify the species of the powers, than to diversify the species of \npassions or actions. For just as in the physical order, diversity of \ngenus arises from diversity in the potentiality of matter, while \ndiversity of species arises from diversity of form in the same matter; so \nin the acts of the soul, those that belong to different powers, differ \nnot only in species but also in genus, while acts and passions regarding \ndifferent specific objects, included under the one common object of a \nsingle power, differ as the species of that genus.\nIn order, therefore, to discern which passions are in the irascible, and \nwhich in the concupiscible, we must take the object of each of these \npowers.

        "ANS": "Passion is a kind of movement, as stated in Phys. iii, 3. \nTherefore contrariety of passions is based on contrariety of movements or \nchanges. Now there is a twofold contrariety in changes and movements, as \nstated in Phys. v, 5. One is according to approach and withdrawal in \nrespect of the same term: and this contrariety belongs properly to \nchanges, i.e. to generation, which is a change \"to being,\" and to \ncorruption, which is a change \"from being.\" The other contrariety is \naccording to opposition of termini, and belongs properly to movements: \nthus whitening, which is movement from black to white, is contrary to \nblackening, which is movement from white to black.\nAccordingly there is a twofold contrariety in the passions of the soul: \none, according to contrariety of objects, i.e. of good and evil; the \nother, according to approach and withdrawal in respect of the same term. \nIn the concupiscible passions the former contrariety alone is to be \nfound; viz. that which is based on the objects: whereas in the irascible \npassions, we find both forms of contrariety. The reason of this is that \nthe object of the concupiscible faculty, as stated above (Article [1]), is \nsensible good or  evil considered absolutely. Now good, as such, cannot \nbe a term wherefrom, but only a term whereto, since nothing shuns good as \nsuch; on the contrary, all things desire it. In like manner, nothing \ndesires evil, as such; but all things shun it: wherefore evil cannot have \nthe aspect of a term whereto, but only of a term wherefrom. Accordingly \nevery concupiscible passion in respect of good, tends to it, as love, \ndesire and joy; while every concupiscible passion in respect of evil, \ntends from it, as hatred, avoidance or dislike, and sorrow. Wherefore, in \nthe concupiscible passions, there can be no contrariety of approach and \nwithdrawal in respect of the same object.\nOn the other hand, the object of the irascible faculty is sensible good \nor evil, considered not absolutely, but under the aspect of difficulty or \narduousness. Now the good which is difficult or arduous, considered as \ngood, is of such a nature as to produce in us a tendency to it, which \ntendency pertains to the passion of \"hope\"; whereas, considered as \narduous or difficult, it makes us turn from it; and this pertains to the \npassion of \"despair.\" In like manner the arduous evil, considered as an \nevil, has the aspect of something to be shunned; and this belongs to the \npassion of \"fear\": but it also contains a reason for tending to it, as \nattempting something arduous, whereby to escape being subject to evil; \nand this tendency is called \"daring.\" Consequently, in the irascible \npassions we find contrariety in respect of good and evil (as between hope \nand fear): and also contrariety according to approach and withdrawal in \nrespect of the same term (as between daring and fear).\nFrom what has been said the replies to the objections are evident."

For anger is caused by a \ndifficult evil already present: and when such an evil is present, the \nappetite must needs either succumb, so that it does not go beyond the \nlimits of \"sadness,\" which is a concupiscible passion; or else it has a \nmovement of attack on the hurtful evil, which movement is that of \n\"anger.\" But it cannot have a movement of withdrawal: because the evil is \nsupposed to be already present or past. Thus no passion is contrary to \nanger according to contrariety of approach and withdrawal.\nIn like manner neither can there be according to contrariety of good and \nevil. Because the opposite of present evil is good obtained, which can be \nno longer have the aspect of arduousness or difficulty.

Now, \nthe difference in active causes may be considered in two ways: first, \nfrom the point of view of their species or nature, as fire differs from \nwater; secondly, from the point of view of the difference in their active \npower. In the passions of the soul we can treat the difference of their \nactive or motive causes in respect of their motive power, as if they were \nnatural agents. For every mover, in a fashion, either draws the patient \nto itself, or repels it from itself. Now in drawing it to itself, it does \nthree things in the patient. Because, in the first place, it gives the \npatient an inclination or aptitude to tend to the mover: thus a light \nbody, which is above, bestows lightness on the body generated, so that it \nhas an inclination or aptitude to be above. Secondly, if the generated \nbody be outside its proper place, the mover gives it movement towards \nthat place. Thirdly, it makes it to rest, when it shall have come to its \nproper place: since to the same cause are due, both rest in a place, and \nthe movement to that place. The same applies to the cause of repulsion.\nNow, in the movements of the appetitive faculty, good has, as it were, a \nforce of attraction, while evil has a force of repulsion. In the first \nplace, therefore, good causes, in the appetitive power, a certain \ninclination, aptitude or connaturalness in respect of good: and this \nbelongs to the passion of \"love\": the corresponding contrary of which is \n\"hatred\" in respect of evil. Secondly, if the good be not yet possessed, \nit causes in the appetite a movement towards the attainment of the good \nbeloved: and this belongs to the passion of \"desire\" or \"concupiscence\": \nand contrary to it, in respect of evil, is the passion of \"aversion\" or \n\"dislike.\" Thirdly, when the good is obtained, it causes the appetite to \nrest, as it were, in the good obtained: and this belongs to the passion \nof \"delight\" or \"joy\"; the contrary of which, in respect of evil, is \n\"sorrow\" or \"sadness.\"\nOn the other hand, in the irascible passions, the aptitude, or \ninclination to seek good, or to shun evil, is presupposed as arising from \nthe concupiscible faculty, which regards good or evil absolutely. And in \nrespect of good not yet obtained, we have \"hope\" and \"despair.\" In \nrespect of evil not yet present we have \"fear\" and \"daring.\" But in \nrespect of good obtained there is no irascible  passion: because it is no \nlonger considered in the light of something arduous, as stated above \n(Article [3]). But evil already present gives rise to the passion of \"anger.\"\nAccordingly it is clear that in the concupiscible faculty there are \nthree couples of passions; viz. love and hatred, desire and aversion, joy \nand sadness. In like manner there are three groups in the irascible \nfaculty; viz. hope and despair, fear and daring, and anger which has not \ncontrary passion.\nConsequently there are altogether eleven passions differing \nspecifically; six in the concupiscible faculty, and five in the \nirascible; and under these all the passions of the soul are contained.\nFrom this the replies to the objections are evident."

In like manner \nfear adds to aversion or detestation a certain lowness of spirits, on \naccount of difficulty in shunning the evil.\nAccordingly the passions of the irascible faculty stand between those \nconcupiscible passions that denote movement towards good or evil, and \nthose concupiscible passions that denote rest in good or evil.

Consequently the \norder of the concupiscible passions can be considered either in the order \nof intention or in the order of execution.

Now it is evident that whatever tends to an end, has, \nin the first place, an aptitude or proportion to that end, for nothing \ntends to a disproportionate end; secondly, it is moved to that end; \nthirdly, it rests in the end, after having attained it. And this very \naptitude or proportion of the appetite to good is love, which is \ncomplacency in good; while movement towards good is desire or \nconcupiscence; and rest in good is joy or pleasure. Accordingly in this \norder, love precedes desire, and desire precedes pleasure. But in the \norder of intention, it is the reverse: because the pleasure intended \ncauses desire and love.

As a matter \nof fact, the presence of good produces no passion in the irascible, as \nstated above (Question [23], Articles [3],4); but the presence of evil gives rise to the \npassion of anger.\nSince then in order of generation or execution, proportion or aptitude \nto the end precedes the achievement of the end; it follows that, of all \nthe irascible passions, anger is the last in the order of generation. And \namong the other passions of the irascible faculty, which imply a movement \narising from love of good or hatred of evil, those whose object is good, \nviz. hope and despair, must naturally precede those whose object is evil, \nviz. daring and fear: yet so that hope precedes despair; since hope is a \nmovement towards good as such, which is essentially attractive, so that \nhope tends to good directly; whereas despair is a movement away from \ngood, a movement which is consistent with good, not as such, but in \nrespect of something else, wherefore its tendency from good is \naccidental, as it were. In like manner fear, through being a movement \nfrom evil, precedes daring. And that hope and despair naturally precede \nfear and daring is evident from this---that as the desire of good is the \nreason for avoiding evil, so hope and despair are the reason for fear and \ndaring: because daring arises from the hope of victory, and fear arises \nfrom the despair of overcoming. Lastly, anger arises from daring: for no \none is angry while seeking vengeance, unless he dare to avenge himself, \nas Avicenna observes  in the sixth book of his Physics. Accordingly, it \nis evident that hope is the first of all the irascible passions.\nAnd if we wish to know the order of all the passions in the way of \ngeneration, love and hatred are first; desire and aversion, second; hope \nand despair, third; fear and daring, fourth; anger, fifth; sixth and \nlast, joy and sadness, which follow from all the passions, as stated in \nEthic. ii, 5: yet so that love precedes hatred; desire precedes aversion; \nhope precedes despair; fear precedes daring; and joy precedes sadness, as \nmay be gathered from what has been stated above.",

Consequently the perfection of knowledge \nrequires that man should know distinctly all that is in a thing, such as \nits parts, powers, and properties. On the other hand, love is in the \nappetitive power, which regards a thing as it is in itself: wherefore it \nsuffices, for the perfection of love, that a thing be loved according as \nit is known in itself.

Another kind of likeness arises from one thing having potentially \nand by way of inclination, a quality which the other has actually: thus \nwe may say that a heavy body existing outside its proper place is like \nanother heavy body that exists in its proper place: or again, according \nas potentiality bears a resemblance to its act; since act is contained, \nin a manner, in the potentiality itself.\nAccordingly the first kind of likeness causes love of friendship or \nwell-being.

Now love being twofold, viz. love of concupiscence \nand love of friendship; each of these arises from a kind of apprehension \nof the oneness of the thing loved with the lover. For when we love a \nthing, by desiring it, we apprehend it as belonging to our well-being.

Thus it \nis written concerning the Holy Ghost, Who is God's Love, that He \n\"searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God\" (1 Cor. 2:10).\nAs the appetitive power, the object loved is said to be in the lover, \ninasmuch as it is in his affections, by a kind of complacency: causing \nhim either to take pleasure in it, or in its good, when present; or, in \nthe absence of the object loved, by his longing, to tend towards it with \nthe love of concupiscence, or towards the good that he wills to the \nbeloved, with the love of friendship: not indeed from any extrinsic cause \n(as when we desire one thing on account of another, or wish good to \nanother on account of something else), but because the complacency in the \nbeloved is rooted in the lover's heart. For this reason we speak of love \nas being \"intimate\"; and \"of the bowels of charity.\" On the other  hand, \nthe lover is in the beloved, by the love of concupiscence and by the love \nof friendship, but not in the same way.

But if a thing be adapted to \nthat which is not suitable to it, it is hurt and made worse thereby. \nConsequently love of a suitable good perfects and betters the lover; but \nlove of a good which is unsuitable to the lover, wounds and worsens him. \nWherefore man is  perfected and bettered chiefly by the love of God: but \nis wounded and worsened by the love of sin, according to Osee 9:10: \"They \nbecame abominable, as those things which they loved.\"\nAnd let this be understood as applying to love in respect of its formal \nelement, i.e. in regard to the appetite. But in respect of the material \nelement in the passion of love, i.e. a certain bodily change, it happens \nthat love is hurtful, by reason of this change being excessive: just as \nit happens in the senses, and in every act of a power of the soul that is \nexercised through the change of some bodily organ.\nIn reply to the objections, it is to be observed that four proximate \neffects may be ascribed to love: viz. melting, enjoyment, languor, and \nfervor. Of these the first is \"melting,\" which is opposed to freezing. \nFor things that are frozen, are closely bound together, so as to be hard \nto pierce. But it belongs to love that the appetite is fitted to receive \nthe good which is loved, inasmuch as the object loved is in the lover, as \nstated above (Article [2]). Consequently the freezing or hardening of the heart \nis a disposition incompatible with love: while melting denotes a \nsoftening of the heart, whereby the heart shows itself to be ready for \nthe entrance of the beloved. If, then, the beloved is present and \npossessed, pleasure or enjoyment ensues. But if the beloved be absent, \ntwo passions arise; viz. sadness at its absence, which is denoted by \n\"languor\" (hence Cicero in De Tusc. Quaest. iii, 11 applies the term \n\"ailment\" chiefly to sadness); and an intense desire to possess the \nbeloved, which is signified by \"fervor.\" And these are the effects of \nlove considered formally, according to the relation of the appetitive \npower to its object. But in the passion of love, other effects ensue, \nproportionate to the above, in respect of a change in the organ."

Wherefore, absolutely speaking, the soul's movement in respect \nof good is stronger than its movement in respect of evil.\nNevertheless hatred sometimes seems to be stronger than love, for two \nreasons. First, because hatred is more keenly felt than love. For, since \nthe sensitive perception is accompanied by a certain impression; when \nonce the impression has been received it is not felt so keenly as in the \nmoment of receiving it. Hence the heat of a hectic fever, though greater, \nis nevertheless not felt so much as the heat of tertian fever; because \nthe heat of the hectic fever is habitual and like a second nature. For \nthis reason, love is felt more keenly in the absence of the object loved; \nthus Augustine says (De Trin. x, 12) that \"love is felt more keenly when \nwe lack what we love.\" And for the same reason, the unbecomingness of \nthat which is hated is felt more keenly than the becomingness of that \nwhich is loved. Secondly, because comparison is made between a hatred and \na love which are not mutually corresponding. Because, according to \ndifferent degrees of good there are different degrees of love to which \ncorrespond different degrees of hatred. Wherefore a hatred that \ncorresponds to a greater love, moves us more than a lesser love.\nHence it is clear how to reply to the First Objection.

But just as in nature there is \npotential successive infinity, so can this kind of concupiscence be \ninfinite successively; so that, for instance, after getting food, a man \nmay desire food yet again; and so of anything else that nature requires: \nbecause these bodily goods, when obtained, do not last for ever, but \nfail.

On the other hand, \nconcupiscence of the means is not infinite, because the concupiscence of \nthe means is in suitable proportion to the end. Consequently those who \nplace their end in riches have an infinite concupiscence of riches; \nwhereas those who desire riches, on account of the necessities of life, \ndesire a finite measure of riches, sufficient for the necessities of \nlife, as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3).

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [1]), pleasure arises from union with a \nsuitable object perceived or known. Now, in the operations of the soul, \nespecially of the sensitive and intellectual soul, it must be noted that, \nsince they do not pass into outward matter, they are acts or perfections \nof the agent, e.g. to understand, to feel, to will and the like: because \nactions which pass into outward matter, are actions and perfections \nrather of the matter transformed; for \"movement is the act produced by \nthe mover in the thing moved\" (Phys. iii, 3). Accordingly the aforesaid \nactions of the sensitive and intellectual soul, are themselves a certain \ngood of the agent, and are known by sense and intellect. Wherefore from \nthem also does pleasure arise, and not only from  their objects.\nIf therefore we compare intellectual pleasures with sensible pleasures, \naccording as we delight in the very actions, for instance in sensitive \nand in intellectual knowledge; without doubt intellectual pleasures are \nmuch greater than sensible pleasures. For man takes much more delight in \nknowing something, by understanding it, than in knowing something by \nperceiving it with his sense. Because intellectual knowledge is more \nperfect; and because it is better known, since the intellect reflects on \nits own act more than sense does. Moreover intellectual knowledge is more \nbeloved: for there is no one who would not forfeit his bodily sight \nrather than his intellectual vision, as beasts or fools are deprived \nthereof, as Augustine says in De Civ. Dei (De Trin. xiv, 14).\nIf, however, intellectual spiritual pleasures be compared with sensible \nbodily pleasures, then, in themselves and absolutely speaking, spiritual \npleasures are greater. And this appears from the consideration of the \nthree things needed for pleasure, viz. the good which is brought into \nconjunction, that to which it is conjoined, and the conjunction itself. \nFor spiritual good is both greater and more beloved than bodily good: a \nsign whereof is that men abstain from even the greatest bodily pleasures, \nrather than suffer loss of honor which is an intellectual good. Likewise \nthe intellectual faculty is much more noble and more knowing than the \nsensitive faculty. Also the conjunction is more intimate, more perfect \nand more firm. More intimate, because the senses stop at the outward \naccidents of a thing, whereas the intellect penetrates to the essence; \nfor the object of the intellect is \"what a thing is.\" More perfect, \nbecause the conjunction of the sensible to the sense implies movement, \nwhich is an imperfect act: wherefore sensible pleasures are not perceived \nall at once, but some part of them is passing away, while some other part \nis looked forward to as yet to be realized, as is manifest in pleasures \nof the table and in sexual pleasures: whereas intelligible things are \nwithout movement: hence pleasures of this kind are realized all at once. \nMore firm; because the objects of bodily pleasure are corruptible, and \nsoon pass away; whereas spiritual goods are incorruptible.\nOn the other hand, in relation to us, bodily pleasures are more \nvehement, for three reasons. First, because sensible things are more \nknown to us, than intelligible things. Secondly, because sensible \npleasures, through being passions of the sensitive appetite, are \naccompanied by some alteration in the body: whereas this does not occur \nin spiritual pleasures, save by reason of a certain reaction of the \nsuperior appetite on the lower. Thirdly, because bodily pleasures are \nsought as remedies for bodily defects or troubles, whence various griefs \narise. Wherefore bodily pleasures, by reason of their succeeding griefs \nof this kind, are felt the more, and consequently are welcomed more than \nspiritual pleasures, which have no contrary griefs, as we shall state \nfarther on (Question [35], Article [5]).",

Now, as stated in \nMetaph. i, 1, the senses are loved for two reasons: for the purpose of \nknowledge, and on account of their usefulness. Wherefore the senses \nafford pleasure in both these ways. But because it is proper to man to \napprehend knowledge itself as something good, it follows that the former \npleasures of the senses, i.e. those which arise from knowledge, are \nproper to man: whereas pleasures of the senses, as loved for their \nusefulness, are common to all animals.\nIf therefore we speak of that sensible pleasure by which reason of \nknowledge, it is evident that the sight affords greater  pleasure than \nany other sense. On the other hand, if we speak of that sensible pleasure \nwhich is by reason of usefulness, then the greatest pleasure is afforded \nby the touch. For the usefulness of sensible things is gauged by their \nrelation to the preservation of the animal's nature. Now the sensible \nobjects of touch bear the closest relation to this usefulness: for the \ntouch takes cognizance of those things which are vital to an animal, \nnamely, of things hot and cold and the like. Wherefore in this respect, \nthe pleasures of touch are greater as being more closely related to the \nend. For this reason, too, other animals which do not experience sensible \npleasure save by reason of usefulness, derive no pleasure from the other \nsenses except as subordinated to the sensible objects of the touch: \"for \ndogs do not take delight in the smell of hares, but in eating them; . . . \nnor does the lion feel pleasure in the lowing of an ox, but in devouring \nit\" (Ethic. iii, 10).\nSince then the pleasure afforded by touch is the greatest in respect of \nusefulness, and the pleasure afforded by sight the greatest in respect of \nknowledge; if anyone wish to compare these two, he will find that the \npleasure of touch is, absolutely speaking, greater than the pleasure of \nsight, so far as the latter remains within the limits of sensible \npleasure. Because it is evident that in everything, that which is natural \nis most powerful: and it is to these pleasures of the touch that the \nnatural concupiscences, such as those of food, sexual union, and the \nlike, are ordained.

And in this sense, that which pertains to the preservation of the \nbody, either as regards the individual, as food, drink, sleep, and the \nlike, or as regards the species, as sexual intercourse, are said to \nafford man natural pleasure. Under each kind of pleasures, we find some \nthat are \"not natural\" speaking absolutely, and yet \"connatural\" in some \nrespect. For it happens in an individual that some one of the natural \nprinciples of the species is corrupted, so that something which is \ncontrary to the specific nature, becomes accidentally natural to this \nindividual: thus it is natural to this hot water to give heat. \nConsequently it happens that something which is not natural to man, \neither in regard to reason, or in regard to the preservation of the body, \nbecomes connatural to this individual man, on account of there being some \ncorruption of nature in him.

Another principle is man's habitual inclination \nto do good, by reason of which doing good becomes connatural to him: for \nwhich reason the liberal man takes pleasure in giving to others. The \nthird principle is the motive: for instance when a man is moved by one \nwhom he loves, to do good to someone: for whatever we do or suffer for a \nfriend is pleasant, because love is the principal cause of pleasure.",

Wherefore all those games in which there is a striving for \nthe mastery, and a possibility of winning it, afford the greatest \npleasure: and speaking generally all contests, in so far as they admit \nhope of victory. To contradict and to scold can give pleasure in two \nways. First, as making man imagine himself to be wise and excellent; \nsince it belongs to wise men and elders to reprove and to scold. \nSecondly, in so far as by scolding and reproving, one does good to \nanother: for this gives one pleasure, as stated above. It is pleasant to \nan angry man to punish, in so far as he thinks himself to be removing an \napparent slight, which seems to be due to a previous hurt: for when a man \nis hurt by another, he seems to be slighted thereby; and therefore he \nwishes to be quit of this slight by paying back the hurt. And thus it is \nclear that doing good to another may be of itself pleasant: whereas doing \nevil to another is not pleasant, except in so far as it seems to affect \none's own good."

        "ANS": "Pleasure can be considered in two ways; first, as \nexisting in reality; secondly, as existing in the memory. Again thirst, \nor desire, can be taken in two ways; first, properly, as denoting a \ncraving for something not possessed; secondly, in general, as excluding \ndistaste.\nConsidered as existing in reality, pleasure does not of itself cause \nthirst or desire for itself, but only accidentally; provided we take \nthirst or desire as denoting a craving for some thing not possessed: \nbecause pleasure is an emotion of the appetite in respect of something \nactually present. But it may happen that what is actually present is not \nperfectly possessed: and this may be on the part of the thing possessed, \nor on the part of the possessor. On the part of the thing possessed, this \nhappens through the thing possessed not being a simultaneous whole; \nwherefore one obtains possession of it successively, and while taking \npleasure in what one has, one desires to possess the remainder: thus if a \nman is pleased with the first part of a verse, he desires to hear the \nsecond part, as Augustine says (Confess. iv, 11). In this way nearly all \nbodily pleasures cause thirst for themselves, until they are fully \nrealized, because pleasures of this kind arise from some movement: as is \nevident in pleasures of the table. On the part of the possessor, this \nhappens when a man possesses a thing which is perfect in itself, yet does \nnot possess it perfectly, but obtains possession of it little by little. \nThus in this life, a faint perception of Divine knowledge affords us \ndelight, and delight sets up a thirst or desire for perfect knowledge; in \nwhich sense we may understand the words of Ecclus. 24:29: \"They that \ndrink me shall yet thirst.\"\nOn the other hand, if by thirst or desire we understand the mere \nintensity of the emotion, that excludes distaste, thus more than all \nothers spiritual pleasures cause thirst or desire for themselves. Because \nbodily pleasures become distasteful by reason of their causing an excess \nin the natural mode of being, when they are increased or even when they \nare protracted; as is evident in the case of pleasures of the table. This \nis why, when a man arrives at the point of perfection in bodily \npleasures, he wearies of them, and sometimes desires another kind. \nSpiritual pleasures, on the contrary, do not exceed the natural mode of \nbeing, but perfect nature. Hence when their point of perfection is \nreached, then do they afford the greatest delight: except, perchance, \naccidentally,  in so far as the work of contemplation is accompanied by \nsome operation of the bodily powers, which tire from protracted activity. \nAnd in this sense also we may understand those words of Ecclus. 24:29: \n\"They that drink me shall yet thirst\": for, even of the angels, who know \nGod perfectly, and delight in Him, it is written (1 Pt. 1:12) that they \n\"desire to look at Him.\"\nLastly, if we consider pleasure, not as existing in reality, but as \nexisting in the memory, thus it has of itself a natural tendency to cause \nthirst and desire for itself: when, to wit, man returns to that \ndisposition, in which he was when he experienced the pleasure that is \npast. But if he be changed from that disposition, the memory of that \npleasure does not give him pleasure, but distaste: for instance, the \nmemory of food in respect of a man who has eaten to repletion.",

The reason seems to have been that they took \naccount only of sensible and bodily pleasures which are more manifest; \nsince, also in other respects, the ancient philosophers did not \ndiscriminate between the intelligible and the sensible, nor between \nintellect and sense (De Anima iii, 3). And they held that all bodily \npleasures should be reckoned as bad, and thus that man, being prone to \nimmoderate pleasures, arrives at the mean of virtue by abstaining from \npleasure. But they were wrong in holding this opinion. Because, since \nnone can live without some sensible and bodily pleasure, if they who \nteach that all pleasures are evil, are found in the act of taking \npleasure; men will be more inclined to  pleasure by following the example \nof their works instead of listening to the doctrine of their words: \nsince, in human actions and passions, wherein experience is of great \nweight, example moves more than words.\nWe must therefore say that some pleasures are good, and that some are \nevil. For pleasure is a repose of the appetitive power in some loved \ngood, and resulting from some operation; wherefore we assign a twofold \nreason for this assertion. The first is in respect of the good in which a \nman reposes with pleasure. For good and evil in the moral order depend on \nagreement or disagreement with reason, as stated above (Question [18], Article [5]): \njust as in the order of nature, a thing is said to be natural, if it \nagrees with nature, and unnatural, if it disagrees. Accordingly, just as \nin the natural order there is a certain natural repose, whereby a thing \nrests in that which agrees with its nature, for instance, when a heavy \nbody rests down below; and again an unnatural repose, whereby a thing \nrests in that which disagrees with its nature, as when a heavy body rests \nup aloft: so, in the moral order, there is a good pleasure, whereby the \nhigher or lower appetite rests in that which is in accord with reason; \nand an evil pleasure, whereby the appetite rests in that which is \ndiscordant from reason and the law of God.\nThe second reason can be found by considering the actions, some of which \nare good, some evil. Now pleasures which are conjoined to actions are \nmore akin to those actions, than desires, which precede them in point of \ntime. Wherefore, since the desires of good actions are good, and of evil \nactions, evil; much more are the pleasures of good actions good, and \nthose of evil actions evil.",

Accordingly in those \nthings that are specified by absolute forms, it happens that species \ncontained under contrary genera are not contrary as to their specific \nnature: but it does not happen for them to have any affinity or \nfittingness to one another. For intemperance and justice, which are in \nthe contrary genera of virtue and vice, are not contrary to one another \nin respect of  their specific nature; and yet they have no affinity or \nfittingness to one another. On the other hand, in those things that are \nspecified in relation to something extrinsic, it happens that species \nbelonging to contrary genera, are not only not contrary to one another, \nbut also that they have a certain mutual affinity or fittingness. The \nreason of this is that where there is one same relation to two \ncontraries, there is contrariety; e.g. to approach to a white thing, and \nto approach to a black thing, are contraries; whereas contrary relations \nto contrary things, implies a certain likeness, e.g. to recede from \nsomething white, and to approach to something black.

        "ANS": "The pleasure of contemplation can be understood in two \nways. In one way, so that contemplation is the cause, but not the object \nof pleasure: and then pleasure is taken not in contemplating but in the \nthing contemplated. Now it is possible to contemplate something harmful \nand sorrowful, just as to contemplate something suitable and pleasant. \nConsequently if the pleasure of contemplation be taken in this way, \nnothing hinders some sorrow being contrary to the pleasure of \ncontemplation.\nIn another way, the pleasure of contemplation is understood, so that \ncontemplation is its object and cause; as when one takes pleasure in the \nvery act of contemplating. And thus, according to Gregory of Nyssa \n[*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xviii.], \"no sorrow is contrary to that pleasure \nwhich is about contemplation\": and the  Philosopher says the same (Topic. \ni, 13; Ethic. x, 3). This, however, is to be understood as being the case \nproperly speaking. The reason is because sorrow is of itself contrary to \npleasure in a contrary object: thus pleasure in heat is contrary to \nsorrow caused by cold. But there is no contrary to the object of \ncontemplation: because contraries, as apprehended by the mind, are not \ncontrary, but one is the means of knowing the other. Wherefore, properly \nspeaking, there cannot be a sorrow contrary to the pleasure of \ncontemplation. Nor has it any sorrow annexed to it, as bodily pleasures \nhave, which are like remedies against certain annoyances; thus a man \ntakes pleasure in drinking through being troubled with thirst, but when \nthe thirst is quite driven out, the pleasure of drinking ceases also. \nBecause the pleasure of contemplation is not caused by one's being quit \nof an annoyance, but by the fact that contemplation is pleasant in \nitself: for pleasure is not a \"becoming\" but a perfect operation, as \nstated above (Question [31], Article [1]).\nAccidentally, however, sorrow is mingled with the pleasure of \ncontemplation; and this in two ways: first, on the part of an organ, \nsecondly, through some impediment in the apprehension. On the part of an \norgan, sorrow or pain is mingled with apprehension, directly, as regards \nthe apprehensive powers of the sensitive part, which have a bodily organ; \neither from the sensible object disagreeing with the normal condition of \nthe organ, as the taste of something bitter, and the smell of something \nfoul; or from the sensible object, though agreeable, being so continuous \nin its action on the sense, that it exceeds the normal condition of the \norgan, as stated above (Question [33], Article [2]), the result being that an \napprehension which at first was pleasant becomes tedious. But these two \nthings cannot occur directly in the contemplation of the mind; because \nthe mind has no corporeal organ: wherefore it was said in the authority \nquoted above that intellectual contemplation has neither \"bitterness,\" \nnor \"tediousness.\" Since, however, the human mind, in contemplation, \nmakes use of the sensitive powers of apprehension, to whose acts \nweariness is incidental; therefore some affliction or pain is indirectly \nmingled with contemplation.\nNevertheless, in neither of these ways, is the pain thus accidentally \nmingled with contemplation, contrary to the pleasure thereof. Because \npain caused by a hindrance to contemplation, is not contrary to the \npleasure of contemplation, but rather is in affinity and in harmony with \nit, as is evident from what has been said above (Article [4]): while pain or \nsorrow caused by bodily weariness, does not belong to the same genus, \nwherefore it is altogether disparate. Accordingly it is evident that no \nsorrow is contrary to pleasure taken in the very act of contemplation; \nnor is any sorrow connected with it save accidentally.",
        "RP1": "The \"sorrow which is according to God,\" is not caused by \nthe very act of intellectual contemplation, but by something which the \nmind contemplates: viz. by sin, which the mind considers as contrary to \nthe love of God.",

Therefore it is natural and right \nfor sorrow to be shunned more than pleasure is sought.",

But the shunning of sorrow is due to \nthe contrariety of the cause of sorrow; whereas the desire for pleasure \ndoes not arise from any contrariety, but rather from the suitableness of \nthe pleasant object. Therefore sorrow is shunned more eagerly than \npleasure is sought.",
        "OB3": "Further, the stronger the passion which a man resists according \nto reason, the more worthy is he of praise, and the more virtuous: since \n\"virtue is concerned with the difficult and the good\" (Ethic. ii, 3). But \nthe brave man who resists the movement of shunning sorrow, is more \nvirtuous than the temperate man, who resists the movement of desire for \npleasure: since the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that \"the brave and \nthe just are chiefly praised.\" Therefore the movement of shunning sorrow \nis more eager than the movement of seeking pleasure.",
        "CON": "Good is stronger than evil, as Dionysius declares (Div. \nNom. iv). But pleasure is desirable for the sake of the good which is its \nobject; whereas the shunning of sorrow is on account of evil. Therefore \nthe desire for pleasure is more eager than the shunning of sorrow.",
        "ANS": "The desire for pleasure is of itself more eager than the \nshunning of sorrow. The reason of this is that the cause of pleasure is a \nsuitable good; while the cause of pain or sorrow is an unsuitable evil. \nNow it happens that a certain good is suitable without any repugnance at \nall: but it is not possible for any evil to be so unsuitable as not to be \nsuitable in some way. Wherefore pleasure can be entire and perfect: \nwhereas sorrow is always partial. Therefore desire for pleasure is \nnaturally greater than the shunning of sorrow. Another reason is because \nthe good, which is the object of pleasure, is sought for its own sake: \nwhereas the evil, which is the object of sorrow, is to be shunned as \nbeing a privation of good: and that which is by reason of itself is \nstronger than that which is by reason of something else. Moreover we find \na confirmation of this in natural movements. For every natural movement \nis more intense in the end, when a thing approaches the term that is \nsuitable to its nature, than at the beginning, when it leaves the term \nthat is unsuitable to its nature: as though nature were more eager in \ntending to what is suitable to it, than in shunning what is unsuitable. \nTherefore the inclination of the appetitive power is, of itself, more \neager in tending to pleasure than in shunning sorrow.\nBut it happens accidentally that a man shuns sorrow more eagerly than he \nseeks pleasure: and this for three reasons. First, on the part of the \napprehension. Because, as Augustine says (De Trin. x, 12), \"love is felt \nmore keenly, when we lack that which we love.\" Now from the lack of what \nwe love, sorrow results, which is caused either by the loss of some loved \ngood, or by the presence of some contrary evil. But pleasure suffers no \nlack of the good loved, for it rests in possession of it. Since then love \nis the cause of pleasure and sorrow, the latter is more the shunned, \naccording as love is the more keenly felt on account of that which is \ncontrary to it. Secondly, on the part of the cause of sorrow or pain, \nwhich cause is repugnant to a good that is more loved than the good in \nwhich we take pleasure. For we love the natural well-being of the body \nmore than the pleasure of eating: and consequently we would leave the \npleasure of eating and the like, from fear of the pain occasioned by \nblows or other such causes, which are contrary to the well-being of the \nbody. Thirdly, on the part of the effect: namely, in so far as sorrow \nhinders not only one pleasure, but all.",
        "RP1": "The saying of Augustine that \"sorrow is shunned more than \npleasure is sought\" is true accidentally but not simply. And this is \nclear from what he says after: \"Since we see that the most savage animals \nare deterred from the greatest pleasures by fear of pain,\" which pain is \ncontrary to life which is loved above all.",
        "RP2": "It is not the same with movement from within and movement \nfrom without. For movement from within tends to what is suitable more \nthan it recedes from that which is unsuitable; as we remarked above in \nregard to natural movement. But movement from without is intensified by \nthe very opposition: because each thing strives in its own way to resist \nanything contrary to it, as aiming  at its own preservation. Hence \nviolent movement is intense at first, and slackens towards the end. Now \nthe movement of the appetitive faculty is from within: since it tends \nfrom the soul to the object. Consequently pleasure is, of itself, more to \nbe sought than sorrow is to be shunned. But the movement of the sensitive \nfaculty is from without, as it were from the object of the soul. \nConsequently the more contrary a thing is the more it is felt. And then \ntoo, accidentally, in so far as the senses are requisite for pleasure and \npain, pain is shunned more than pleasure is sought.",

But the temperate man is praised for refraining from pleasures \nof touch, more than for not shunning the pains which are contrary to \nthem, as is stated in Ethic. iii, 11."

But they differ in respect of those two \nthings which are requisite for pain and pleasure; namely, in respect of \nthe cause, which is a conjoined good or evil; and in respect of the \napprehension. For the cause of  outward pain is a conjoined evil \nrepugnant to the body; while the cause of inward pain is a conjoined evil \nrepugnant to the appetite. Again, outward pain arises from an \napprehension of sense, chiefly of touch; while inward pain arises from an \ninterior apprehension, of the imagination or of the reason.\nIf then we compare the cause of inward pain to the cause of outward \npain, the former belongs, of itself, to the appetite to which both these \npains belong: while the latter belongs to the appetite directly. Because \ninward pain arises from something being repugnant to the appetite itself, \nwhile outward pain arises from something being repugnant to the appetite, \nthrough being repugnant to the body. Now, that which is of itself is \nalways prior to that which is by reason of another. Wherefore, from this \npoint of view, inward pain surpasses outward pain. In like manner also on \nthe part of apprehension: because the apprehension of reason and \nimagination is of a higher order than the apprehension of the sense of \ntouch. Consequently inward pain is, simply and of itself, more keen than \noutward pain: a sign whereof is that one willingly undergoes outward pain \nin order to avoid inward pain: and in so far as outward pain is not \nrepugnant to the interior appetite, it becomes in a manner pleasant and \nagreeable by way of inward joy. Sometimes, however, outward pain is \naccompanied by inward pain, and then the pain is increased. Because \ninward pain is not only greater than outward pain, it is also more \nuniversal: since whatever is repugnant to the body, can be repugnant to \nthe interior appetite; and whatever is apprehended by sense may be \napprehended by imagination and reason, but not conversely.

For this reason, as stated above (Question [22], Article [3]; Question [31], Article [5]), the body undergoes a greater change from  the movement of the \nsensitive appetite: and, in like manner, from outward than from inward \npain."

But, secondly, a thing may be added to a genus, that is, as \nit were, foreign to the notion conveyed by that genus: thus \"white\" or \nsomething of the kind may be added to \"animal.\" Such an addition does not \nmake true species of the genus, according to the usual sense in which we \nspeak of genera and species.

For if, in \nnatural movements, we observe those of approach and withdrawal, approach \nis of itself directed to something suitable to nature; while withdrawal \nis of itself directed to something contrary to nature; thus a heavy body, \nof itself, withdraws from a higher place, and approaches naturally to a \nlower place.

In this way, even the acts of the \napprehensive power, such as understanding, feeling, and remembering, as \nwell as the movements of the animal appetite, are sometimes said to be \nnatural.\nAnd in this sense we may say that there is a natural fear; and it is \ndistinguished from non-natural fear, by reason of the diversity of its \nobject.

Wherefore, since fear implies an avoidance, \nin the first place and of its very nature it regards evil as its proper \nobject.\nIt can, however, regard good also, in so far as referable to evil. This \ncan be in two ways. In one way, inasmuch as an evil  causes privation of \ngood. Now a thing is evil from the very fact that it is a privation of \nsome good. Wherefore, since evil is shunned because it is evil, it \nfollows that it is shunned because it deprives one of the good that one \npursues through love thereof. And in this sense Augustine says that there \nis no cause for fear, save loss of the good we love.\nIn another way, good stands related to evil as its cause: in so far as \nsome good can by its power bring harm to the good we love: and so, just \nas hope, as stated above (Question [40], Article [7]), regards two things, namely, the \ngood to which it tends, and the thing through which there is a hope of \nobtaining the desired good; so also does fear regard two things, namely, \nthe evil from which it shrinks, and that good which, by its power, can \ninflict that evil. In this way God is feared by man, inasmuch as He can \ninflict punishment, spiritual or corporal. In this way, too, we fear the \npower of man; especially when it has been thwarted, or when it is unjust, \nbecause then it is more likely to do us a harm.\nIn like manner one fears \"to be over another,\" i.e. to lean on another, \nso that it is in his power to do us a harm: thus a man fears another, who \nknows him to be guilty of a crime lest he reveal it to others.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the Objections."

Consequently  evil of nature can be the object of fear.\nBut it must be observed that evil of nature sometimes arises from a \nnatural cause; and then it is called evil of nature, not merely from \nbeing a privation of the good of nature, but also from being an effect of \nnature; such are natural death and other like defects. But sometimes evil \nof nature arises from a non-natural cause; such as violent death \ninflicted by an assailant. In either case evil of nature is feared to a \ncertain extent, and to a certain extent not. For since fear arises \"from \nthe imagination of future evil,\" as the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5), \nwhatever removes the imagination of the future evil, removes fear also. \nNow it may happen in two ways that an evil may not appear as about to be. \nFirst, through being remote and far off: for, on account of the distance, \nsuch a thing is considered as though it were not to be. Hence we either \ndo not fear it, or fear it but little; for, as the Philosopher says \n(Rhet. ii, 5), \"we do not fear things that are very far off; since all \nknow that they shall die, but as death is not near, they heed it not.\" \nSecondly, a future evil is considered as though it were not to be, on \naccount of its being inevitable, wherefore we look upon it as already \npresent. Hence the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that \"those who are \nalready on the scaffold, are not afraid,\" seeing that they are on the \nvery point of a death from which there is no escape; \"but in order that a \nman be afraid, there must be some hope of escape for him.\"\nConsequently evil of nature is not feared if it be not apprehended as \nfuture: but if evil of nature, that is corruptive, be apprehended as near \nat hand, and yet with some hope of escape, then it will be feared.",

On the other hand, in those who are afraid, the internal \nheat and vital spirits move from the heart downwards, as stated above (ad \n1): wherefore fear hinders speech which ensues from the emission of the \nvital spirits in an upward direction through the mouth: the result being \nthat fear makes its subject speechless. For this reason, too, fear \"makes \nits subject tremble,\" as the Philosopher says (De Problem. xxvii, 1,6,7).",

Hence it is that \"those who are in \nfear of death turn pale\" (Ethic. iv, 9). But the evil that shame fears, \nis contrary, not to nature, but only to the appetite of the soul. \nConsequently there results a contraction in this appetite, but not in the \ncorporeal nature; in fact, the soul, as though contracted in itself, is \nfree to set the vital spirits and heat in movement, so that they spread \nto the outward parts of the body: the result being that those who are \nashamed blush."

This is evident in the \ncase of love and hatred: for we love someone, in so far as we wish some \ngood to be in him; and we hate someone, in so far as we wish some evil to \nbe in him. It is the same with anger; for when a man is angry, he wishes \nto be avenged on someone. Hence the movement of anger has a twofold \ntendency: viz. to vengeance itself, which it desires and hopes for as \nbeing a good, wherefore it takes pleasure in it; and to the person on \nwhom it seeks vengeance, as to something contrary and hurtful, which \nbears the character of evil.\nWe must, however, observe a twofold difference in this respect, between \nanger on the one side, and hatred and love on the other. The first \ndifference is that anger always regards two objects: whereas love and \nhatred sometimes regard but one object, as when a man is said to love \nwine or something of the kind, or to hate it. The second difference is, \nthat both the objects of love are good: since the lover wishes good to \nsomeone, as to something agreeable to himself: while both the objects of \nhatred bear the character of evil: for the man who hates, wishes evil to \nsomeone, as to something disagreeable to him. Whereas anger regards one \nobject under the aspect of evil, viz. the noxious person, on whom it \nseeks to be avenged. Consequently it is a passion somewhat made up of \ncontrary passions.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the Objections."

Consequently the question as to whether a \nparticular passion is more or less natural cannot be decided without \nreference to the cause of that passion. Now the cause of a passion, as \nstated above (Question [36], Article [2]), may be considered in two ways: first, on the \npart of the object; secondly, on the part of the subject. If then we \nconsider the cause of anger and of desire, on the part of the object, \nthus desire, especially of pleasures of the table, and of sexual \npleasures, is more natural than anger; in so far as these pleasures are \nmore natural to man than vengeance.\nIf, however, we consider the cause of anger on the part of the subject, \nthus anger, in a manner, is more natural; and, in a manner, desire is \nmore natural. Because the nature of an individual man may be considered \neither as to the generic, or as to the specific nature, or again as to \nthe particular temperament of the individual. If then we consider the \ngeneric nature, i.e. the nature of this man considered as an animal; thus \ndesire is more natural than anger; because it is from this very generic \nnature that man is inclined to desire those things which tend to preserve \nin him the life both of the species and of the individual.

And if we consider the nature of the \nindividual, in respect of his particular temperament, thus anger is more \nnatural than desire; for  the reason that anger is prone to ensue from \nthe natural tendency to anger, more than desire, or any other passion, is \nto ensue from a natural tendency to desire, which tendencies result from \na man's individual temperament. Because disposition to anger is due to a \nbilious temperament; and of all the humors, the bile moves quickest; for \nit is like fire. Consequently he that is temperamentally disposed to \nanger is sooner incensed with anger, than he that is temperamentally \ndisposed to desire, is inflamed with desire: and for this reason the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. vii, 6) that a disposition to anger is more \nliable to be transmitted from parent to child, than a disposition to \ndesire.",

Hence it is written \n(Ecclus. 12:16): \"An enemy . . . if he find an opportunity, will not be \nsatisfied with blood.\" Anger, on the other hand, seeks evil only under \nthe aspect of a just means of vengeance. Consequently when the evil \ninflicted goes beyond the measure of justice according to the estimate of \nthe angry man, then he has mercy. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. \nii, 4) that \"the angry man is appeased if many evils befall, whereas the \nhater is never appeased.\"\nAs to the intensity of the desire, anger excludes mercy more than hatred \ndoes; because the movement of anger is more impetuous, through the \nheating of the bile.

The hater, on the other \nhand, cares not for all this, since he desires another's evil as such. It \nis not  true, however, that an evil is worse through giving pain: because \n\"injustice and imprudence, although evil,\" yet, being voluntary, \"do not \ngrieve those in whom they are,\" as the Philosopher observes (Rhet. ii, 4).",

        "CON": "The Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 2) that anger is \"a \ndesire, with sorrow, for vengeance, on account of a seeming slight done \nunbecomingly.\"",
        "ANS": "All the causes of anger are reduced to slight. For slight \nis of three kinds, as stated in Rhet. ii, 2, viz. \"contempt,\" \"despiteful \ntreatment,\" i.e. hindering one from doing one's will, and \"insolence\": \nand all motives of anger are reduced to these three. Two reasons may be \nassigned for this. First, because anger seeks another's hurt as being a \nmeans of just vengeance: wherefore it seeks vengeance in so far as it \nseems just. Now just vengeance is taken only for that which is done \nunjustly;  hence that which provokes anger is always something considered \nin the light of an injustice. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, \n3) that \"men are not angry---if they think they have wronged some one and \nare suffering justly on that account; because there is no anger at what \nis just.\" Now injury is done to another in three ways: namely, through \nignorance, through passion, and through choice. Then, most of all, a man \ndoes an injustice, when he does an injury from choice, on purpose, or \nfrom deliberate malice, as stated in Ethic. v, 8. Wherefore we are most \nof all angry with those who, in our opinion, have hurt us on purpose. For \nif we think that some one has done us an injury through ignorance or \nthrough passion, either we are not angry with them at all, or very much \nless: since to do anything through ignorance or through passion takes \naway from the notion of injury, and to a certain extent calls for mercy \nand forgiveness. Those, on the other hand, who do an injury on purpose, \nseem to sin from contempt; wherefore we are angry with them most of all. \nHence the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3) that \"we are either not angry at \nall, or not very angry with those who have acted through anger, because \nthey do not seem to have acted slightingly.\"\nThe second reason is because a slight is opposed to a man's excellence: \nbecause \"men think little of things that are not worth much ado\" (Rhet. \nii, 2). Now we seek for some kind of excellence from all our goods. \nConsequently whatever injury is inflicted on us, in so far as it is \nderogatory to our excellence, seems to savor of a slight.",
        "RP1": "Any other cause, besides contempt, through which a man \nsuffers an injury, takes away from the notion of injury: contempt or \nslight alone adds to the motive of anger, and consequently is of itself \nthe cause of anger.",
        "RP2": "Although a dumb animal does not seek honor as such, yet it \nnaturally seeks a certain superiority, and is angry with anything \nderogatory thereto.",
        "RP3": "Each of those causes amounts to some kind of slight. Thus \nforgetfulness is a clear sign of slight esteem, for the more we think of \na thing the more is it fixed in our memory. Again if a man does not \nhesitate by his remarks to give pain to another, this seems to show that \nhe thinks little of him: and those too who show signs of hilarity when \nanother is in misfortune, seem to care little about his good or evil. \nAgain he that hinders another from carrying out his will, without \nderiving thereby any profit to himself, seems not to care much for his \nfriendship.

Thus \na nobleman is angry if he be insulted by a peasant; a wise man, if by a \nfool; a master, if by a servant.\nIf, however, the littleness or deficiency lessens the unmerited \ncontempt, then it does not increase but lessens anger.

Now it is clear from what has been said \n(Question [47], Articles [1],3), that the movement of anger arises from a wrong done \nthat causes sorrow, for which sorrow vengeance is sought as a remedy. \nConsequently as soon as vengeance is present, pleasure ensues, and so \nmuch the greater according as the sorrow was greater. Therefore if \nvengeance be really present, perfect pleasure ensues, entirely excluding \nsorrow, so that the movement of anger ceases. But before vengeance is \nreally present, it becomes present to the angry man in two ways: in one \nway, by hope; because none is angry except he hopes for  vengeance, as \nstated above (Question [46], Article [1]); in another way, by thinking of it \ncontinually, for to everyone that desires a thing it is pleasant to dwell \non the thought of what he desires; wherefore the imaginings of dreams are \npleasant.

        "OB3": "Further, fervor added to fervor produces greater fervor. But \"the \naddition of a greater anger banishes already existing anger,\" as the \nPhilosopher says (Rhet. ii, 3). Therefore anger does not cause fervor.",
        "CON": "Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that \"anger is \nfervor of the blood around the heart, resulting from an exhalation of the \nbile.\"",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [44], Article [1]), the bodily transmutation \nthat occurs in the passions of the soul is proportionate to the movement \nof the appetite. Now it is evident that every appetite, even the natural \nappetite, tends with greater force to repel that which is contrary to it, \nif it be present: hence we see that hot water freezes harder, as though \nthe cold acted with greater force on the hot object. Since then the \nappetitive movement of anger is caused by some injury inflicted, as by a \ncontrary that is present; it follows that the appetite tends with great \nforce to repel the injury by the desire of vengeance;  and hence ensues \ngreat vehemence and impetuosity in the movement of anger. And because the \nmovement of anger is not one of recoil, which corresponds to the action \nof cold, but one of prosecution, which corresponds to the action of heat, \nthe result is that the movement of anger produces fervor of the blood and \nvital spirits around the heart, which is the instrument of the soul's \npassions. And hence it is that, on account of the heart being so \ndisturbed by anger, those chiefly who are angry betray signs thereof in \ntheir outer members. For, as Gregory says (Moral. v, 30) \"the heart that \nis inflamed with the stings of its own anger beats quick, the body \ntrembles, the tongue stammers, the countenance takes fire, the eyes grow \nfierce, they that are well known are not recognized.

Consequently when a man \nsuffers from a hurt done to the excellence that he loves, he feels his \nlove thereof the more: the result being that his heart is moved with \ngreater heat to remove the hindrance to the object of his love; so that \nanger increases the fervor of love and makes it to be felt more.\nNevertheless, the fervor arising from heat differs according as it is to \nbe referred to love or to anger. Because the fervor of love has a certain \nsweetness and gentleness; for it tends to the good that one loves: whence \nit is likened to the warmth of the air and of the blood. For this reason \nsanguine temperaments are more inclined to love; and hence the saying \nthat \"love springs from the liver,\" because of the blood being formed \nthere. On the other hand, the fervor of anger has a certain bitterness \nwith a tendency to destroy, for it seeks to be avenged on the contrary \nevil: whence it is likened to the heat of fire and of the bile, and for \nthis reason Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 16) that it \"results from \nan exhalation of the bile whence it takes its name {chole}.\"",

Consequently the cause of \nanger is impaired little by little as time goes on, until at length it \nvanishes altogether. Moreover a wrong seems greater when it is first \nfelt; and our estimate thereof is gradually lessened the further the \nsense of present wrong recedes into the past. The same applies to love, \nso long as the cause of love is in the memory alone; wherefore the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. viii, 5) that \"if a friend's absence lasts long, \nit seems to make men forget their friendship.\" But in the presence of a \nfriend, the cause of friendship is continually being multiplied by time: \nwherefore the friendship increases: and the same would apply to anger, \nwere its cause continually multiplied.\nNevertheless the very fact that anger soon spends itself proves the \nstrength of its fervor: for as a great fire is soon  spent having burnt \nup all the fuel; so too anger, by reason of its vehemence, soon dies away.",

And, \nfurther, there are some in which there is a medium, not indeed an action \nor passion, but something after the manner of action or passion: thus, \nfor instance, something adorns or covers, and something else is adorned \nor covered: wherefore the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 25) that \"a \nhabit is said to be, as it were, an action or a passion of the haver and \nthat which is had\"; as is the case in those things which we have about \nourselves.

Now, no \ngenus should be contracted to a species by a difference of another genus; \nbut \"differences should be proper to a genus,\" as the Philosopher says in \nMetaph. vii, text. 42. Therefore, since habit is \"a quality difficult to \nchange,\" it seems not to be a distinct species of quality.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher says in the Book of the Predicaments \n(Categor. vi) that \"one species of quality is habit and disposition.\"",
        "ANS": "The Philosopher in the Book of Predicaments (Categor. vi) \nreckons disposition and habit as the first species of quality. Now \nSimplicius, in his Commentary on the Predicaments, explains the \ndifference of these species as follows. He says \"that some qualities are \nnatural, and are in their subject in virtue of its nature, and are always \nthere: but some are adventitious, being caused from without, and these \ncan be lost. Now the latter,\" i.e. those which are adventitious, \"are \nhabits and dispositions, differing in the point of being easily or \ndifficultly lost. As to natural qualities, some regard a thing in the \npoint of its being in a state of potentiality; and thus we have the \nsecond species of quality: while others regard a thing which is in act; \nand this either deeply rooted therein or only on its surface. If deeply \nrooted, we have the third species of quality: if on the surface, we have \nthe fourth species of quality, as shape, and form which is the shape of \nan animated being.\" But this distinction of the species of quality seems \nunsuitable. For there are many shapes, and passion-like qualities, which \nare not natural but adventitious: and there are also many dispositions \nwhich are not adventitious but natural, as health, beauty, and the like. \nMoreover, it does not suit the order of the species, since that which is \nthe more natural is always first.\nTherefore we must explain otherwise the distinction of dispositions and \nhabits from other qualities. For quality, properly speaking, implies a \ncertain mode of substance. Now mode, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, \n3), \"is that which a measure determines\": wherefore it implies a certain \ndetermination according to a certain measure. Therefore, just as that in \naccordance with which the material potentiality [potentia materiae] is \ndetermined to its substantial being, is called quality, which is a \ndifference affecting the substance, so that, in accordance with the \npotentiality of the subject is determined to its accidental being, is \ncalled an accidental quality, which is also a kind of difference, as is \nclear from the Philosopher (Metaph. v, text. 19).\nNow the mode of determination of the subject to accidental being may be \ntaken in regard to the very nature of the subject, or in regard to \naction, and passion resulting from its natural principles, which are \nmatter and form; or again in regard to quantity. If we take the mode or \ndetermination of the subject in regard to quantity, we shall then have \nthe fourth species of quality. And because quantity, considered in \nitself, is devoid of movement, and does not imply the notion of good or \nevil, so it does  not concern the fourth species of quality whether a \nthing be well or ill disposed, nor quickly or slowly transitory.\nBut the mode of determination of the subject, in regard to action or \npassion, is considered in the second and third species of quality. And \ntherefore in both, we take into account whether a thing be done with ease \nor difficulty; whether it be transitory or lasting. But in them, we do \nnot consider anything pertaining to the notion of good or evil: because \nmovements and passions have not the aspect of an end, whereas good and \nevil are said in respect of an end.\nOn the other hand, the mode or determination of the subject, in regard \nto the nature of the thing, belongs to the first species of quality, \nwhich is habit and disposition: for the Philosopher says (Phys. vii, \ntext. 17), when speaking of habits of the soul and of the body, that they \nare \"dispositions of the perfect to the best; and by perfect I mean that \nwhich is disposed in accordance with its nature.\" And since the form \nitself and the nature of a thing is the end and the cause why a thing is \nmade (Phys. ii, text. 25), therefore in the first species we consider \nboth evil and good, and also changeableness, whether easy or difficult; \ninasmuch as a certain nature is the end of generation and movement. And \nso the Philosopher (Metaph. v, text. 25) defines habit, a \"disposition \nwhereby someone is disposed, well or ill\"; and in Ethic. ii, 4, he says \nthat by \"habits we are directed well or ill in reference to the \npassions.\" For when the mode is suitable to the thing's nature, it has \nthe aspect of good: and when it is unsuitable, it has the aspect of evil. \nAnd since nature is the first object of consideration in anything, for \nthis reason habit is reckoned as the first species of quality.",
        "RP1": "Disposition implies a certain order, as stated above (Article [1], ad 3). Wherefore a man is not said to be disposed by some quality except \nin relation to something else. And if we add \"well or ill,\" which belongs \nto the essential notion of habit, we must consider the quality's relation \nto the nature, which is the end. So in regard to shape, or heat, or cold, \na man is not said to be well or ill disposed, except by reason of a \nrelation to the nature of a thing, with regard to its suitability or \nunsuitability. Consequently even shapes and passion-like qualities, in so \nfar as they are considered to be suitable or unsuitable to the nature of \na thing, belong to habits or dispositions: for shape and color, according \nto their suitability to the nature of thing, concern beauty; while heat \nand cold, according to their suitability to the nature of a thing, \nconcern health. And in this way heat and cold are put, by the \nPhilosopher, in the first species of quality.\nWherefore it is clear how to answer the second objection: though some \ngive another solution, as Simplicius says in his Commentary on the \nPredicaments.",
        "RP3": "This difference, \"difficult to change,\" does not \ndistinguish habit from the other species of quality, but from  \ndisposition. Now disposition may be taken in two ways; in one way, as the \ngenus of habit, for disposition is included in the definition of habit \n(Metaph. v, text. 25): in another way, according as it is divided against \nhabit. Again, disposition, properly so called, can be divided against \nhabit in two ways: first, as perfect and imperfect within the same \nspecies; and thus we call it a disposition, retaining the name of the \ngenus, when it is had imperfectly, so as to be easily lost: whereas we \ncall it a habit, when it is had perfectly, so as not to be lost easily. \nAnd thus a disposition becomes a habit, just as a boy becomes a man. \nSecondly, they may be distinguished as diverse species of the one \nsubaltern genus: so that we call dispositions, those qualities of the \nfirst species, which by reason of their very nature are easily lost, \nbecause they have changeable causes; e.g. sickness and health: whereas we \ncall habits those qualities which, by reason of their very nature, are \nnot easily changed, in that they have unchangeable causes, e.g. sciences \nand virtues. And in this sense, disposition does not become habit. The \nlatter explanation seems more in keeping with the intention of Aristotle: \nfor in order to confirm this distinction he adduces the common mode of \nspeaking, according to which, when a quality is, by reason of its nature, \neasily changeable, and, through some accident, becomes difficultly \nchangeable, then it is called a habit: while the contrary happens in \nregard to qualities, by reason of their nature, difficultly changeable: \nfor supposing a man to have a science imperfectly, so as to be liable to \nlose it easily, we say that he is disposed to that science, rather than \nthat he has the science. From this it is clear that the word \"habit\" \nimplies a certain lastingness: while the word \"disposition\" does not.\nNor does it matter that thus to be easy and difficult to change are \nspecific differences (of a quality), although they belong to passion and \nmovement, and not the genus of quality. For these differences, though \napparently accidental to quality, nevertheless designate differences \nwhich are proper and essential to quality. In the same way, in the genus \nof substance we often take accidental instead of substantial differences, \nin so far as by the former, essential principles are designated."

But a thing's nature, which is the end of generation, is further \nordained to another end, which is either an operation, or the product of \nan operation, to which one attains by means of operation. Wherefore habit \nimplies relation not only to the very nature of a thing, but also, \nconsequently, to operation, inasmuch as this is the end of nature, or \nconducive to the end.

The first condition is that which is disposed \nshould be distinct from that to which it is disposed; and so, that it \nshould be related to it as potentiality is to act. Whence, if there is a \nbeing whose nature is not composed of potentiality and act, and whose \nsubstance is its own operation, which itself is for itself, there we can \nfind no room for habit and disposition, as is clearly the case in God.\nThe second condition is, that that which is in a state of potentiality \nin regard to something else, be capable of determination in several ways \nand to various things. Whence if something be in a state of potentiality \nin regard to something else, but in regard to that only, there we find no \nroom for disposition and habit: for such a subject from its own nature \nhas the due relation to such an act. Wherefore if a heavenly body be \ncomposed of matter and form, since that matter is not in a state of \npotentiality to another form, as we said in the FP, Question [56], Article [2], there is \nno need for disposition or habit in respect of the form, or even in \nrespect of operation, since the nature of the heavenly body is not in a \nstate of potentiality to more than one fixed movement.\nThe third condition is that in disposing the subject to one of  those \nthings to which it is in potentiality, several things should occur, \ncapable of being adjusted in various ways: so as to dispose the subject \nwell or ill to its form or to its operation. Wherefore the simple \nqualities of the elements which suit the natures of the elements in one \nsingle fixed way, are not called dispositions or habits, but \"simple \nqualities\": but we call dispositions or habits, such things as health, \nbeauty, and so forth, which imply the adjustment of several things which \nmay vary in their relative adjustability. For this reason the Philosopher \nsays (Metaph. v, text. 24,25) that \"habit is a disposition\": and \ndisposition is \"the order of that which has parts either as to place, or \nas to potentiality, or as to species,\" as we have said above (Article [1], ad 3).

Therefore in so far as habit implies disposition to \noperation, no habit is principally in the body as its subject. For every \noperation of the body proceeds either from a natural quality of the body \nor from the soul moving the body. Consequently, as to those operations \nwhich proceed from its nature, the body is not disposed by a habit: \nbecause the natural forces are determined to one mode of operation; and \nwe have already said (Question [49], Article [4]) that it is when the subject is in \npotentiality to many things that a habitual disposition is required. As \nto the operations which proceed from the soul through the body, they \nbelong principally to the soul, and secondarily to the body. Now habits \nare in proportion to their operations: whence \"by like acts like habits \nare formed\" (Ethic. ii, 1,2). And therefore the dispositions to such \noperations are principally in the soul. But they can be secondarily in \nthe body: to wit, in so far as the body is disposed and enabled with \npromptitude to help in the operations of the soul.\nIf, however, we speak of the disposition of the subject to form, thus a \nhabitual disposition can be in the body, which is related to the soul as \na subject is to its form. And in this way health and beauty and such like \nare called habitual dispositions. Yet they have not the nature of habit \nperfectly: because their causes, of their very nature, are easily \nchangeable.\nOn the other hand, as Simplicius reports in his Commentary on the \nPredicaments, Alexander denied absolutely that habits or dispositions of \nthe first species are in the body: and held that the first species of \nquality belonged to the soul alone. And he held that Aristotle mentions \nhealth and sickness in the Book on the Predicaments not as though they \nbelonged to the first species of quality, but by way of example: so that \nhe would mean that just as health and sickness may be easy or difficult \nto change, so also are all the qualities of the first species, which are \ncalled habits and dispositions.

But \nqualities of the soul are simply difficult to change, on account of the \nunchangeableness of the subject. And therefore he does not say that \nhealth which is difficult to change is a habit simply: but that it is \"as \na habit,\" as we read in the Greek [*{isos hexin} (Categor. viii)]. On the \nother hand, the qualities of the soul are called habits simply.",

But when they have attained to perfection \n(specific perfection, so to speak), they have then passed into the first \nspecies of quality. But Simplicius in his Commentary disapproves of this; \nfor in this way heating would be in the third species, and heat in the \nfirst species of quality; whereas Aristotle puts heat in the third.\nWherefore Porphyrius, as Simplicius reports (Commentary), says that \npassion or passion-like quality, disposition and habit, differ in bodies \nby way of intensity and remissness. For when a thing receives heat in \nthis only that it is being heated, and not so as to be able to give heat, \nthen we have passion, if it is transitory; or passion-like quality if it \nis permanent. But when it has been brought to the point that it is able \nto heat something else, then it is a disposition; and if it goes so far \nas to be firmly fixed and to become difficult to change, then it will be \na habit: so that disposition would be a certain intensity of passion or \npassion-like quality, and habit an intensity or disposition. But \nSimplicius disapproves of this, for such intensity and remissness do not \nimply diversity on the part of the form itself, but on the part of the \ndiverse participation thereof by the subject; so that there would be no \ndiversity among the species of quality. And therefore we must say \notherwise that, as was explained above (Question [49], Article [2], ad 1), the \nadjustment of the passion-like qualities themselves, according to their \nsuitability to nature, implies the notion of disposition: and so, when a \nchange takes place in these same passion-like qualities, which are heat \nand cold, moisture and dryness, there results a change as to sickness and \nhealth. But change does not occur in regard to like habits and \ndispositions, primarily and of  themselves."

For it is manifest that men differ in habits; and so it was \nimpossible to put the habits of knowledge directly in that, which, being \nonly one, would be common to all men.

For it is manifest that the sensitive powers are rational, not \nby their essence, but only by participation (Ethic. i, 13). Now the \nPhilosopher puts the intellectual virtues, which are wisdom, science and \nunderstanding, in that which is rational by its essence.

In the \nsecond place, this supposition is contrary to the truth. For as to whom \nbelongs the operation, belongs also the power to operate, belongs also \nthe habit.

For habit is not a disposition of the object to \nthe power, but rather a disposition of the power to the object: wherefore \nthe habit needs to be in that power which is principle of the act, and \nnot in that which is compared to the power as its object.\nNow the act of understanding is not said to be common to soul and body, \nexcept in respect of the phantasm, as is stated in De Anima, text. 66. \nBut it is clear that the phantasm is compared as object to the passive \nintellect (De Anima iii, text. 3,39).

Therefore \nthe angelic essences are perfected of themselves unto conformity with \nGod, and therefore not by means of habits.

For everything divine is \nsufficient of itself, and exists in itself.\"\nNow this opinion contains some truth, and some error. For it is manifest \nfrom what we have said (Question [49], Article [4]) that only a being in potentiality is \nthe subject of habit. So the above-mentioned commentators considered that \nangels are immaterial substances, and that there is no material \npotentiality in them, and on that account, excluded from them habit and \nany kind of accident. Yet since though there is no material potentiality \nin angels, there is still some potentiality in them (for to be pure act \nbelongs to God alone), therefore, as far as potentiality is found to be \nin them, so far may habits be found in them. But because the potentiality \nof matter and the potentiality of intellectual substance are not of the \nsame kind. Whence, Simplicius says in his Commentary on the Predicaments \nthat: \"The habits of the intellectual substance are not like the habits \nhere below, but rather are they like simple and  immaterial images which \nit contains in itself.\"\nHowever, the angelic intellect and the human intellect differ with \nregard to this habit. For the human intellect, being the lowest in the \nintellectual order, is in potentiality as regards all intelligible \nthings, just as primal matter is in respect of all sensible forms; and \ntherefore for the understanding of all things, it needs some habit. But \nthe angelic intellect is not as a pure potentiality in the order of \nintelligible things, but as an act; not indeed as pure act (for this \nbelongs to God alone), but with an admixture of some potentiality: and \nthe higher it is, the less potentiality it has. And therefore, as we said \nin the FP, Question [55], Article [1], so far as it is in potentiality, so far is it in \nneed of habitual perfection by means of intelligible species in regard to \nits proper operation: but so far as it is in act, through its own essence \nit can understand some things, at least itself, and other things \naccording to the mode of its substance, as stated in De Causis: and the \nmore perfect it is, the more perfectly will it understand.\nBut since no angel attains to the perfection of God, but all are \ninfinitely distant therefrom; for this reason, in order to attain to God \nHimself, through intellect and will, the angels need some habits, being \nas it were in potentiality in regard to that Pure Act. Wherefore \nDionysius says (Coel.

First in \nrespect of the specific nature, as the faculty of laughing is natural to \nman, and it is natural to fire to have an upward tendency. Secondly, in \nrespect of the individual nature, as it is natural to Socrates or Plato \nto be prone to sickness or inclined to health, in accordance with their \nrespective temperaments. Again, in respect of both natures, something may \nbe called natural in two ways: first, because it entirely is from the \nnature; secondly, because it is partly from nature, and partly from an \nextrinsic principle. For instance, when a man is healed by himself, his \nhealth is entirely from nature; but when a man is healed by means of \nmedicine, health is partly from nature, partly from an extrinsic \nprinciple.\nThus, then, if we speak of habit as a disposition of the subject in \nrelation to form or nature, it may be natural in either of the foregoing \nways. For there is a certain natural disposition demanded by the human \nspecies, so that no man can be without it. And this disposition is \nnatural in respect of the specific nature. But since such a disposition \nhas a certain latitude, it happens that different grades of this \ndisposition are becoming to different men in respect of the individual \nnature. And this disposition may be either entirely from nature, or \npartly from nature, and partly from an extrinsic principle, as we have \nsaid of those who are healed by means of art.\nBut the habit which is a disposition to operation, and whose subject is \na power of the soul, as stated above (Question [50], Article [2]), may be natural \nwhether in respect of the specific nature or in respect of the individual \nnature: in respect of the specific nature, on the  part of the soul \nitself, which, since it is the form of the body, is the specific \nprinciple; but in respect of the individual nature, on the part of the \nbody, which is the material principle. Yet in neither way does it happen \nthat there are natural habits in man, so that they be entirely from \nnature. In the angels, indeed, this does happen, since they have \nintelligible species naturally impressed on them, which cannot be said of \nthe human soul, as we have said in the FP, Question [55], Article [2]; FP, Question [84], Article [3].\nThere are, therefore, in man certain natural habits, owing their \nexistence, partly to nature, and partly to some extrinsic principle: in \none way, indeed, in the apprehensive powers; in another way, in the \nappetitive powers. For in the apprehensive powers there may be a natural \nhabit by way of a beginning, both in respect of the specific nature, and \nin respect of the individual nature. This happens with regard to the \nspecific nature, on the part of the soul itself: thus the understanding \nof first principles is called a natural habit. For it is owing to the \nvery nature of the intellectual soul that man, having once grasped what \nis a whole and what is a part, should at once perceive that every whole \nis larger than its part: and in like manner with regard to other such \nprinciples. Yet what is a whole, and what is a part---this he cannot know \nexcept through the intelligible species which he has received from \nphantasms: and for this reason, the Philosopher at the end of the \nPosterior Analytics shows that knowledge of principles comes to us from \nthe senses.\nBut in respect of the individual nature, a habit of knowledge is natural \nas to its beginning, in so far as one man, from the disposition of his \norgans of sense, is more apt than another to understand well, since we \nneed the sensitive powers for the operation of the intellect.\nIn the appetitive powers, however, no habit is natural in its beginning, \non the part of the soul itself, as to the substance of the habit; but \nonly as to certain principles thereof, as, for instance, the principles \nof common law are called the \"nurseries of virtue.\" The reason of this is \nbecause the inclination to its proper objects, which seems to be the \nbeginning of a habit, does not belong to the habit, but rather to the \nvery nature of the powers.\nBut on the part of the body, in respect of the individual nature, there \nare some appetitive habits by way of natural beginnings.

Wherefore a habit of opinion needs to be caused by many \nacts of the reason, even on the part of the \"possible\" intellect: whereas \na habit of science can be caused by a single act of the reason, so far as \nthe \"possible\" intellect is concerned. But with regard to the lower \napprehensive powers, the same acts need to be repeated many times for \nanything to be firmly impressed on the memory. And so the Philosopher \nsays (De Memor. et Remin. 1) that \"meditation strengthens memory.\" Bodily \nhabits, however, can be caused by one act, if the active principle is of \ngreat power: sometimes, for instance, a strong dose of medicine restores \nhealth at once.\nHence the solutions to the objections are clear."

Wherefore \nsuch habits can never be in man except by Divine infusion, as is the case \nwith all gratuitous virtues.\nThe other reason is, because God can produce the effects of second \ncauses, without these second causes, as we have said in the FP, Question [105], \nArticle [6]. Just as, therefore, sometimes, in order to show His power, He \ncauses health, without its natural cause, but which nature could have \ncaused, so also, at times, for the manifestation of His power, He infuses \ninto man even those habits which can be caused by a natural power.

        "CON": "Faith is a habit, and yet it increases: wherefore the \ndisciples said to our Lord (Lk. 17:5): \"Lord, increase our faith.\" \nTherefore habits increase.",
        "ANS": "Increase, like other things pertaining to quantity, is \ntransferred from bodily quantities to intelligible spiritual things, on \naccount of the natural connection of the intellect with corporeal things, \nwhich come under the imagination. Now in corporeal quantities, a thing is \nsaid to be great, according as it reaches the perfection of quantity due \nto it; wherefore a certain quantity is reputed great in man, which is not \nreputed great in an elephant. And so also in forms, we say a thing is \ngreat because it is perfect. And since good has the nature of perfection, \ntherefore \"in things which are great, but not in quantity, to be greater \nis the same as to be better,\" as Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 8).\nNow the perfection of a form may be considered in two ways: first, in \nrespect of the form itself: secondly, in respect of the participation of \nthe form by its subject. In so far as we consider the perfections of a \nform in respect of the form itself, thus the form is said to be \"little\" \nor \"great\": for instance great or little health or science. But in so far \nas we consider the perfection of a form in respect of the participation \nthereof by the subject, it is said to be \"more\" or \"less\": for instance \nmore or less white or healthy. Now this distinction is not to be \nunderstood as implying that the form has a being outside its matter or \nsubject, but that it is one thing to consider the form according to  its \nspecific nature, and another to consider it in respect of its \nparticipation by a subject.\nIn this way, then, there were four opinions among philosophers \nconcerning intensity and remission of habits and forms, as Simplicius \nrelates in his Commentary on the Predicaments. For Plotinus and the other \nPlatonists held that qualities and habits themselves were susceptible of \nmore or less, for the reason that they were material and so had a certain \nwant of definiteness, on account of the infinity of matter. Others, on \nthe contrary, held that qualities and habits of themselves were not \nsusceptible of more or less; but that the things affected by them \n[qualia] are said to be more or less, in respect of the participation of \nthe subject: that, for instance, justice is not more or less, but the \njust thing. Aristotle alludes to this opinion in the Predicaments \n(Categor. vi). The third opinion was that of the Stoics, and lies between \nthe two preceding opinions. For they held that some habits are of \nthemselves susceptible of more and less, for instance, the arts; and that \nsome are not, as the virtues. The fourth opinion was held by some who \nsaid that qualities and immaterial forms are not susceptible of more or \nless, but that material forms are.\nIn order that the truth in this matter be made clear, we must observe \nthat, in respect of which a thing receives its species, must be something \nfixed and stationary, and as it were indivisible: for whatever attains to \nthat thing, is contained under the species, and whatever recedes from it \nmore or less, belongs to another species, more or less perfect. \nWherefore, the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text. 10) that species of \nthings are like numbers, in which addition or subtraction changes the \nspecies. If, therefore, a form, or anything at all, receives its specific \nnature in respect of itself, or in respect of something belonging to it, \nit is necessary that, considered in itself, it be something of a definite \nnature, which can be neither more nor less. Such are heat, whiteness or \nother like qualities which are not denominated from a relation to \nsomething else: and much more so, substance, which is \"per se\" being. But \nthose things which receive their species from something to which they are \nrelated, can be diversified, in respect of themselves, according to more \nor less: and nonetheless they remain in the same species, on account of \nthe oneness of that to which they are related, and from which they \nreceive their species. For example, movement is in itself more intense or \nmore remiss: and yet it remains in the same species, on account of the \noneness of the term by which it is specified. We may observe the same \nthing in health; for a body attains to the nature of health, according as \nit has a disposition suitable to an animal's nature, to which various \ndispositions may be suitable; which disposition is therefore variable as \nregards more or less, and withal the nature of health remains. Whence the \nPhilosopher says (Ethic. x, 2,3): \"Health itself may be more or less: for \nthe measure is not the same in all, nor is it always the same in one \nindividual; but down to a certain point it may decrease and still remain \nhealth.\"\nNow these various dispositions and measures of health are by  way of \nexcess and defect: wherefore if the name of health were given to the most \nperfect measure, then we should not speak of health as greater or less. \nThus therefore it is clear how a quality or form may increase or decrease \nof itself, and how it cannot.\nBut if we consider a quality or form in respect of its participation by \nthe subject, thus again we find that some qualities and forms are \nsusceptible of more or less, and some not. Now Simplicius assigns the \ncause of this diversity to the fact that substance in itself cannot be \nsusceptible of more or less, because it is \"per se\" being. And therefore \nevery form which is participated substantially by its subject, cannot \nvary in intensity and remission: wherefore in the genus of substance \nnothing is said to be more or less. And because quantity is nigh to \nsubstance, and because shape follows on quantity, therefore is it that \nneither in these can there be such a thing as more or less. Whence the \nPhilosopher says (Phys. vii, text. 15) that when a thing receives form \nand shape, it is not said to be altered, but to be made. But other \nqualities which are further removed from quantity, and are connected with \npassions and actions, are susceptible of more or less, in respect of \ntheir participation by the subject.\nNow it is possible to explain yet further the reason of this diversity. \nFor, as we have said, that from which a thing receives its species must \nremain indivisibly fixed and constant in something indivisible. Wherefore \nin two ways it may happen that a form cannot be participated more or \nless. First because the participator has its species in respect of that \nform. And for this reason no substantial form is participated more or \nless. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text. 10) that, \"as a \nnumber cannot be more or less, so neither can that which is in the \nspecies of substance,\" that is, in respect of its participation of the \nspecific form: \"but in so far as substance may be with matter,\" i.e. in \nrespect of material dispositions, \"more or less are found in substance.\"\nSecondly this may happen from the fact that the form is essentially \nindivisible: wherefore if anything participate that form, it must needs \nparticipate it in respect of its indivisibility. For this reason we do \nnot speak of the species of number as varying in respect of more or less; \nbecause each species thereof is constituted by an indivisible unity. The \nsame is to be said of the species of continuous quantity, which are \ndenominated from numbers, as two-cubits-long, three-cubits-long, and of \nrelations of quantity, as double and treble, and of figures of quantity, \nas triangle and tetragon.\nThis same explanation is given by Aristotle in the Predicaments \n(Categor. vi), where in explaining why figures are not susceptible of \nmore or less, he says: \"Things which are given the nature of a triangle \nor a circle, are accordingly triangles and circles\": to wit, because \nindivisibility is essential to the motion of such, wherefore whatever \nparticipates their nature must participate it in its indivisibility.\nIt is clear, therefore, since we speak of habits and dispositions in \nrespect of a relation to something (Phys. vii, text. 17), that in two \nways intensity and remission may be observed in habits and dispositions. \nFirst, in respect of the habit itself: thus, for instance, we speak of \ngreater or less health; greater or less science, which extends to more or \nfewer things. Secondly, in respect of participation by the subject: in so \nfar as equal science or health is participated more in one than in \nanother, according to a diverse aptitude arising either from nature, or \nfrom custom. For habit and disposition do not give species to the \nsubject: nor again do they essentially imply indivisibility.\nWe shall say further on (Question [66], Article [1]) how it is with the virtues.",

But in corporeal quantities there is no increase \nwithout addition: wherefore (De Gener. i, text. 31) it is said that \n\"increase is an addition to a magnitude already existing.\" Therefore in \nhabits also there is no increase without addition.",
        "OB2": "Further, habit is not increased except by means of some agent. \nBut every agent does something in the passive subject: for instance, that \nwhich heats, causes heat in that which is heated. Therefore there is no \nincrease without addition.",

Therefore that which is less white,  is not made more white, \nexcept by an added whiteness.",
        "CON": "The Philosopher says (Phys. iv, text. 84): \"That which \nis hot is made hotter, without making, in the matter, something hot, that \nwas not hot, when the thing was less hot.\" Therefore, in like manner, \nneither is any addition made in other forms when they increase.",
        "ANS": "The solution of this question depends on what we have \nsaid above (Article [1]). For we said that increase and decrease in forms which \nare capable of intensity and remissness, happen in one way not on the \npart of the very form considered in itself, through the diverse \nparticipation thereof by the subject. Wherefore such increase of habits \nand other forms, is not caused by an addition of form to form; but by the \nsubject participating more or less perfectly, one and the same form. And \njust as, by an agent which is in act, something is made actually hot, \nbeginning, as it were, to participate a form, not as though the form \nitself were made, as is proved in Metaph. vii, text. 32, so, by an \nintense action of the agent, something is made more hot, as it were \nparticipating the form more perfectly, not as though something were added \nto the form.\nFor if this increase in forms were understood to be by way of addition, \nthis could only be either in the form itself or in the subject. If it be \nunderstood of the form itself, it has already been stated (Article [1]) that \nsuch an addition or subtraction would change the species; even as the \nspecies of color is changed when a thing from being pale becomes white. \nIf, on the other hand, this addition be understood as applying to the \nsubject, this could only be either because one part of the subject \nreceives a form which it had not previously (thus we may say cold \nincreases in a man who, after being cold in one part of his body, is cold \nin several parts), or because some other subject is added sharing in the \nsame form (as when a hot thing is added to another, or one white thing to \nanother). But in either of these two ways we have not a more white or a \nmore hot thing, but a greater white or hot thing.\nSince, however, as stated above (Article [1]), certain accidents are of \nthemselves susceptible of more or less, in some of these we may find \nincrease by addition. For movement increases by an addition either to the \ntime it lasts, or to the course it follows: and yet the species remains \nthe same on account of the oneness of the term. Yet movement increases \nthe intensity as to participation in its subject: i.e. in so far as the \nsame movement can be executed more or less speedily or readily. In like \nmanner, science can increase in itself by addition; thus when anyone \nlearns several conclusions of geometry, the same specific habit of \nscience increases in that man. Yet a man's science increases, as to the \nsubject's participation thereof, in intensity, in so far as one man is \nquicker and readier than another in considering the same conclusions.\nAs to bodily habits, it does not seem very probable that they  receive \nincrease by way of addition. For an animal is not said to be simply \nhealthy or beautiful, unless it be such in all its parts. And if it be \nbrought to a more perfect measure, this is the result of a change in the \nsimple qualities, which are not susceptible of increase save in intensity \non the part of the subject partaking of them.\nHow this question affects virtues we shall state further on (Question [66], Article [1]).",
        "RP1": "Even in bodily bulk increase is twofold. First, by addition \nof one subject to another; such is the increase of living things. \nSecondly, by mere intensity, without any addition at all; such is the \ncase with things subject to rarefaction, as is stated in Phys. iv, text. \n63.",

        "ANS": "\"Like acts cause like habits\" (Ethic. ii, 1,2). Now \nthings are like or unlike not only in respect of their qualities being \nthe same or various, but also in respect of the same or a different mode \nof participation. For it is not only black  that is unlike white, but \nalso less white is unlike more white, since there is movement from less \nwhite to more white, even as from one opposite to another, as stated in \nPhys. v, text. 52.\nBut since use of habits depends on the will, as was shown above (Question [50], Article [5]); just as one who has a habit may fail to use it or may act contrary \nto it; so may he happen to use the habit by performing an act that is not \nin proportion to the intensity of the habit. Accordingly, if the \nintensity of the act correspond in proportion to the intensity of the \nhabit, or even surpass it, every such act either increases the habit or \ndisposes to an increase thereof, if we may speak of the increase of \nhabits as we do of the increase of an animal. For not every morsel of \nfood actually increases the animal's size as neither does every drop of \nwater hollow out the stone: but the multiplication of food results at \nlast in an increase of the body. So, too, repeated acts cause a habit to \ngrow. If, however, the act falls short of the intensity of the habit, \nsuch an act does not dispose to an increase of that habit, but rather to \na lessening thereof.\nFrom this it is clear how to solve the objections."

        "ANS": "A form is said to be corrupted directly by its contrary; \nindirectly, through its subject being corrupted. When therefore a habit \nhas a corruptible subject, and a cause that has a contrary, it can be \ncorrupted both ways. This is clearly the case with bodily habits---for \ninstance, health and sickness. But those habits that have an \nincorruptible subject, cannot be corrupted indirectly. There are, \nhowever, some habits which, while residing chiefly in an incorruptible \nsubject, reside nevertheless secondarily in a corruptible subject; such \nis the habit of science which is chiefly indeed in the \"possible\" \nintellect, but secondarily in the sensitive powers of apprehension, as \nstated above (Question [50], Article [3], ad 3). Consequently the habit of science \ncannot be corrupted indirectly, on the part of the \"possible\" intellect, \nbut only on the part of the lower sensitive powers.\nWe must therefore inquire whether habits of this kind can be corrupted \ndirectly. If then there be a habit having a contrary, either on the part \nof itself or on the part of its cause, it can be corrupted directly: but \nif it has no contrary, it cannot be corrupted directly. Now it is evident \nthat an intelligible species residing in the \"possible\" intellect, has no \ncontrary; nor can the active intellect, which is the cause of that \nspecies, have a contrary. Wherefore if in the \"possible\" intellect there \nbe a habit caused immediately by the active intellect, such a habit is \nincorruptible both directly and indirectly. Such are the habits of the \nfirst principles, both speculative and practical, which cannot be \ncorrupted by any forgetfulness or deception whatever: even as the \nPhilosopher says about prudence (Ethic. vi, 5) that \"it cannot be lost by \nbeing forgotten.\" There is, however, in the \"possible\" intellect a habit \ncaused by the reason, to wit, the habit of conclusions, which is called \nscience, to the cause of which something may be contrary in two ways. \nFirst, on the part of those very propositions which are the starting \npoint of the reason: for the assertion \"Good is not good\" is contrary to \nthe assertion \"Good is good\" (Peri Herm. ii). Secondly, on the part of \nthe process of reasoning; forasmuch as a sophistical syllogism is \ncontrary to a dialectic or demonstrative syllogism. Wherefore it is clear \nthat a false reason can corrupt the habit of a true opinion or even of \nscience. Hence the Philosopher, as stated above, says that  \"deception is \nthe corruption of science.\" As to virtues, some of them are intellectual, \nresiding in reason itself, as stated in Ethic. vi, 1: and to these \napplies what we have said of science and opinion. Some, however, viz. the \nmoral virtues, are in the appetitive part of the soul; and the same may \nbe said of the contrary vices. Now the habits of the appetitive part are \ncaused therein because it is natural to it to be moved by the reason. \nTherefore a habit either of virtue or of vice, may be corrupted by a \njudgment of reason, whenever its motion is contrary to such vice or \nvirtue, whether through ignorance, passion or deliberate choice.",

But the intellectual movement of the reason can corrupt \nthe habit of science, even as regards the very root of the habit. In like \nmanner a habit of virtue can be corrupted. Nevertheless when it is said \nthat \"virtue is more lasting than learning,\" this must be understood in \nrespect, not of the subject or cause, but of the act: because the use of \nvirtue continues through the whole of life, whereas the use of learning \ndoes not."

Wherefore, just as several objects can move one passive \npower, so can one passive power be the subject of several acts or \nperfections specifically diverse.

First, in so far as by the habit a man acquires an aptness to a \ngood act; for instance, by the habit of grammar man has the aptness to \nspeak correctly. But grammar does not make a man always speak correctly: \nfor a grammarian may be guilty of a barbarism or make a solecism: and the \ncase is the same with other sciences and arts. Secondly, a habit may \nconfer not only aptness to act, but also the right use of that aptness: \nfor instance, justice not only gives man the prompt will to do just \nactions, but also makes him act justly.\nAnd since good, and, in like manner, being, is said of a thing simply, \nin respect, not of what it is potentially, but of what it is actually: \ntherefore from having habits of the latter sort, man is said simply to do \ngood, and to be good; for instance, because he is just, or temperate; and \nin like manner as regards other such virtues. And since virtue is that \n\"which makes its possessor good, and his work good likewise,\" these \nlatter habits are called virtuous simply: because they make the work to \nbe actually good, and the subject good simply. But the first kind of \nhabits are not called virtues simply: because they do not make the work \ngood except in regard to a certain aptness, nor do they make their \npossessor good simply. For through being gifted in science or art, a man \nis said to be good, not simply, but relatively; for instance, a good \ngrammarian or a good smith. And for this reason science and art are often \ndivided against virtue; while at other times they are called virtues \n(Ethic. vi, 2).\nHence the subject of a habit which is called a virtue in a relative \nsense, can be the intellect, and not only the practical intellect, but \nalso the speculative, without any reference to the will: for thus the \nPhilosopher (Ethic. vi, 3) holds that science, wisdom and understanding, \nand also art, are intellectual virtues. But the subject of a habit which \nis called a virtue simply, can only be the will, or some power in so far \nas it is moved by the will. And the reason of this is, that the will \nmoves to their acts all those other powers that are in some way rational, \nas we have said above (Question [9], Article [1]; Question [17], Articles [1],5; FP, Question [82], Article [4]): and \ntherefore if man do well actually, this is because he has a good will. \nTherefore the virtue which makes a man to do well actually, and not \nmerely to  have the aptness to do well, must be either in the will \nitself; or in some power as moved by the will.\nNow it happens that the intellect is moved by the will, just as are the \nother powers: for a man considers something actually, because he wills to \ndo so. And therefore the intellect, in so far as it is subordinate to the \nwill, can be the subject of virtue absolutely so called. And in this way \nthe speculative intellect, or the reason, is the subject of Faith: for \nthe intellect is moved by the command of the will to assent to what is of \nfaith: for \"no man believeth, unless he will\" [*Augustine: Tract. xxvi in \nJoan.]. But the practical intellect is the subject of prudence. For since \nprudence is the right reason of things to be done, it is a condition \nthereof that man be rightly disposed in regard to the principles of this \nreason of things to be done, that is in regard to their ends, to which \nman is rightly disposed by the rectitude of the will, just as to the \nprinciples of speculative truth he is rightly disposed by the natural \nlight of the active intellect.

Thus we read (2 Macc. 1:2) that \"rushing violently upon the \nenemy, like lions [*Leonum more, i.e. as lions are in the habit of \ndoing], they slew them\": and the word is used in the same sense in Ps. \n67:7, where we read: \"Who maketh men of one manner [moris] to dwell in a \nhouse.\" For both these significations there is but one word in Latin; but \nin the Greek there is a distinct word for each, for the word \"ethos\" is \nwritten sometimes with a long, and sometimes a short \"e\".\nNow \"moral\" virtue is so called from \"mos\" in the sense of a natural or \nquasi-natural inclination to do some particular action. And the other \nmeaning of \"mos,\" i.e. \"custom,\" is akin to this: because custom becomes \na second nature, and produces an inclination similar to a natural one. \nBut it is evident that inclination to an action belongs properly to the \nappetitive power, whose function it is to move all the powers to their \nacts, as explained above (Question [9], Article [1]).

For some obey reason blindly and without \nany contradiction whatever: such are the limbs of the body, provided they \nbe in a healthy condition, for as soon as reason commands, the hand or \nthe foot proceeds to action. Hence the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3) \nthat \"the soul rules the body like a despot,\" i.e. as a master rules his \nslave, who has no right to rebel. Accordingly some held that all the \nactive principles in man are subordinate to reason in this way. If this \nwere true, for man to act well it would suffice that his reason be \nperfect. Consequently, since virtue is a habit perfecting man in view of \nhis doing good actions, it would follow that it is only in the reason, so \nthat there would be none but intellectual virtues. This was the opinion \nof Socrates, who said \"every virtue is a kind of prudence,\" as stated in \nEthic. vi, 13. Hence he maintained that as long as man is in possession \nof knowledge, he cannot sin; and that every one who sins, does so through \nignorance.\nNow this is based on a false supposition. Because the appetitive faculty \nobeys the reason, not blindly, but with a certain power of opposition; \nwherefore the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 3) that \"reason commands the \nappetitive faculty by a politic power,\" whereby a man rules over subjects \nthat are free, having a certain right of opposition. Hence Augustine says \non Ps. 118 (Serm. 8) that \"sometimes we understand [what is right] while \ndesire is slow, or follows not at all,\" in so far as the habits or \npassions of the appetitive faculty cause the use of reason to be impeded \nin  some particular action. And in this way, there is some truth in the \nsaying of Socrates that so long as a man is in possession of knowledge he \ndoes not sin: provided, however, that this knowledge is made to include \nthe use of reason in this individual act of choice.\nAccordingly for a man to do a good deed, it is requisite not only that \nhis reason be well disposed by means of a habit of intellectual virtue; \nbut also that his appetite be well disposed by means of a habit of moral \nvirtue. And so moral differs from intellectual virtue, even as the \nappetite differs from the reason.

        "ANS": "The Stoics and Peripatetics disagreed on this point, as \nAugustine relates (De Civ. Dei ix, 4). For the Stoics held that the \nsoul's passions cannot be in a wise or virtuous man: whereas the \nPeripatetics, who were founded by Aristotle, as Augustine says (De Civ. \nDei ix, 4), maintained that the passions are compatible with moral \nvirtue, if they be reduced to the mean.\nThis difference, as Augustine observes (De Civ. Dei ix, 4), was one of \nwords rather than of opinions. Because the Stoics, through not \ndiscriminating between the intellective appetite, i.e. the will, and the \nsensitive appetite, which is divided into irascible and concupiscible, \ndid not, as the Peripatetics did, distinguish the passions from the other \naffections of the human soul, in the point of their being movements of \nthe sensitive  appetite, whereas the other emotions of the soul, which \nare not passions, are movements of the intellective appetite or will; but \nonly in the point of the passions being, as they maintained, any emotions \nin disaccord with reason. These emotions could not be in a wise or \nvirtuous man if they arose deliberately: while it would be possible for \nthem to be in a wise man, if they arose suddenly: because, in the words \nof Aulus Gellius [*Noct. Attic. xix, 1], quoted by Augustine (De Civ. Dei \nix, 4), \"it is not in our power to call up the visions of the soul, known \nas its fancies; and when they arise from awesome things, they must needs \ndisturb the mind of a wise man, so that he is slightly startled by fear, \nor depressed with sorrow,\" in so far as \"these passions forestall the use \nof reason without his approving of such things or consenting thereto.\"\nAccordingly, if the passions be taken for inordinate emotions, they \ncannot be in a virtuous man, so that he consent to them deliberately; as \nthe Stoics maintained. But if the passions be taken for any movements of \nthe sensitive appetite, they can be in a virtuous man, in so far as they \nare subordinate to reason. Hence Aristotle says (Ethic. ii, 3) that \"some \ndescribe virtue as being a kind of freedom from passion and disturbance; \nthis is incorrect, because the assertion should be qualified\": they \nshould have said virtue is freedom from those passions \"that are not as \nthey should be as to manner and time.\"",

It \nmay be said, however, that when he says \"a gentle man is not passionate,\" \nwe are to understand this of inordinate passion.",

        "ANS": "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 8), the Stoics held \nthat in the mind of the wise man there are three {eupatheiai}, i.e. \n\"three good passions,\" in place of the three disturbances: viz. instead \nof covetousness, \"desire\"; instead of mirth, \"joy\"; instead of fear, \n\"caution.\" But they denied that anything corresponding to sorrow could be \nin the mind of a wise man, for two reasons.\nFirst, because sorrow is for an evil that is already present. Now they \nheld that no evil can happen to a wise man: for they thought that, just \nas man's only good is virtue, and bodily goods are no good to man; so \nman's only evil is vice, which cannot be in a virtuous man. But this is \nunreasonable. For, since man is composed of soul and body, whatever \nconduces to preserve the life of the body, is some good to man; yet not \nhis supreme good, because he can abuse it. Consequently the evil which is \ncontrary to this good can be in a wise man, and can cause him moderate \nsorrow. Again, although a virtuous man can be without grave sin, yet no \nman is to be found to live without committing slight sins, according to 1 \nJn. 1:8: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.\" A third \nreason is because a virtuous man, though not actually in a state of sin, \nmay have been so in the past. And he is to be commended if he sorrow for \nthat sin, according to 2 Cor. 7:10: \"The sorrow that is according to God \nworketh penance steadfast unto salvation.\" Fourthly, because he may \npraiseworthily sorrow for another's sin. Therefore sorrow is compatible \nwith moral virtue in the same way as the other passions are when \nmoderated by reason.\nTheir second reason for holding this opinion was that sorrow is about \nevil present, whereas fear is for evil to come: even as pleasure is about \na present good, while desire is for a future good. Now the enjoyment of a \ngood possessed, or the desire to have good that one possesses not, may be \nconsistent with virtue: but depression of the mind resulting from sorrow \nfor a present evil, is altogether contrary to reason: wherefore it is \nincompatible with virtue. But this is unreasonable. For there is an evil \nwhich can be present to the virtuous man, as we have just stated; which \nevil is rejected by reason. Wherefore the sensitive appetite follows \nreason's rejection by sorrowing for that evil; yet moderately, according \nas reason dictates. Now it pertains to virtue that the  sensitive \nappetite be conformed to reason, as stated above (Article [1], ad 2). Wherefore \nmoderated sorrow for an object which ought to make us sorrowful, is a \nmark of virtue; as also the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6,7). Moreover, \nthis proves useful for avoiding evil: since, just as good is more readily \nsought for the sake of pleasure, so is evil more undauntedly shunned on \naccount of sorrow.\nAccordingly we must allow that sorrow for things pertaining to virtue is \nincompatible with virtue: since virtue rejoices in its own. On the other \nhand, virtue sorrows moderately for all that thwarts virtue, no matter \nhow.",

The reason for this is that good and evil, in certain \noperations, are taken from the very nature of those operations, no matter \nhow man may be affected towards them: viz. in so far as good and evil in \nthem depend on their being commensurate with someone else. In operations \nof this kind there  needs to be some power to regulate the operations in \nthemselves: such are buying and selling, and all such operations in which \nthere is an element of something due or undue to another. For this reason \njustice and its parts are properly about operations as their proper \nmatter. On the other hand, in some operations, good and evil depend only \non commensuration with the agent.

        "CON": "Chastity is about sexual pleasures, abstinence about \npleasures of the table, and \"eutrapelia\" about pleasures in games.",
        "ANS": "The perfection of a virtue depends on the reason; whereas \nthe perfection of a passion depends on the sensitive appetite. \nConsequently virtues must needs be differentiated according to their \nrelation to reason, but the passions according to their relation to the \nappetite. Hence the objects of the passions, according as they are \nvariously related to the sensitive appetite, cause the different species \nof passions: while, according as they are related to reason, they cause \nthe different species of virtues. Now the movement of reason is not the \nsame as that of the sensitive appetite. Wherefore nothing hinders a \ndifference of objects from causing diversity of passions, without causing \ndiversity of virtues, as when one virtue is about several passions, as \nstated above (Article [4]); and again, a difference of objects from causing \ndifferent virtues, without causing a difference of passions, since \nseveral virtues are directed about one passion, e.g. pleasure.\nAnd because diverse passions belonging to diverse powers, always belong \nto diverse virtues, as stated above (Article [4]); therefore a difference of \nobjects that corresponds to a difference of powers always causes a \nspecific difference of virtues---for instance the difference between that \nwhich is good absolutely speaking, and that which is good and difficult \nto obtain. Moreover since the reason rules man's lower powers in a \ncertain order, and even extends to outward things; hence, one single \nobject of the passions, according as it is apprehended by sense, \nimagination, or reason, and again, according as it belongs to the soul, \nbody, or external things, has various relations to reason, and \nconsequently is of a nature to cause a difference of virtues. \nConsequently man's good which is the object of love, desire and pleasure, \nmay be taken as referred either to a bodily sense, or to the inner \napprehension of the mind: and this same good may be directed to man's \ngood in himself, either in his body or in his soul, or to man's good in \nrelation to other men. And every such difference, being differently \nrelated to reason, differentiates virtues.\nAccordingly, if we take a good, and it be something discerned by the \nsense of touch, and something pertaining to the upkeep of human life \neither in the individual or in the species, such as the pleasures of the \ntable or of sexual intercourse, it will belong to the virtue of \n\"temperance.\" As regards the pleasures of the other senses, they are not \nintense, and so do not present much difficulty to the reason: hence there \nis no virtue corresponding to them; for virtue, \"like art, is about \ndifficult things\" (Ethic. ii, 3).\nOn the other hand, good discerned not by the senses, but by an inner \npower, and belonging to man in himself, is like money and honor; the \nformer, by its very nature, being employable for the good of the body, \nwhile the latter is based on the apprehension of the mind. These goods \nagain may be considered either absolutely, in which way they concern the \nconcupiscible faculty, or as being difficult to obtain, in which way they \nbelong to the irascible part: which distinction, however, has no place in \npleasurable objects of touch; since such are of base condition, and are  \nbecoming to man in so far as he has something in common with irrational \nanimals. Accordingly in reference to money considered as a good \nabsolutely, as an object of desire, pleasure, or love, there is \n\"liberality\": but if we consider this good as difficult to get, and as \nbeing the object of our hope, there is \"magnificence\" [*{megaloprepeia}]. \nWith regard to that good which we call honor, taken absolutely, as the \nobject of love, we have a virtue called \"philotimia\" [*{philotimia}], \ni.e. \"love of honor\": while if we consider it as hard to attain, and as \nan object of hope, then we have \"magnanimity.\" Wherefore liberality and \n\"philotimia\" seem to be in the concupiscible part, while magnificence and \nmagnanimity are in the irascible.\nAs regards man's good in relation to other men, it does not seem hard to \nobtain, but is considered absolutely, as the object of the concupiscible \npassions. This good may be pleasurable to a man in his behavior towards \nanother either in some serious matter, in actions, to wit, that are \ndirected by reason to a due end, or in playful actions, viz. that are \ndone for mere pleasure, and which do not stand in the same relation to \nreason as the former. Now one man behaves towards another in serious \nmatters, in two ways. First, as being pleasant in his regard, by becoming \nspeech and deeds: and this belongs to a virtue which Aristotle (Ethic. \nii, 7) calls \"friendship\" [*{philia}], and may be rendered \"affability.\" \nSecondly, one man behaves towards another by being frank with him, in \nwords and deeds: this belongs to another virtue which (Ethic. iv, 7) he \ncalls \"truthfulness\" [*{aletheia}]. For frankness is more akin to the \nreason than pleasure, and serious matters than play. Hence there is \nanother virtue about the pleasures of games, which the Philosopher \n\"eutrapelia\" [*{eutrapelia}] (Ethic. iv, 8).\nIt is therefore evident that, according to Aristotle, there are ten \nmoral virtues about the passions, viz. fortitude, temperance, liberality, \nmagnificence, magnanimity, \"philotimia,\" gentleness, friendship, \ntruthfulness, and \"eutrapelia,\" all of which differ in respect of their \ndiverse matter, passions, or objects: so that if we add \"justice,\" which \nis about operations, there will be eleven in all.",

Hence there is but one virtue, \nmeekness, for every form of anger; and, again, but one virtue, fortitude, \nfor all forms of daring. On the other hand, good involves difficulty, \nwhich requires virtue, even if it be not a great good in that particular \nkind of passion.

In this way they are called \nprincipal, being general, as it were, in comparison with all the virtues: \nso that, for instance, any virtue that causes good in reason's act of \nconsideration, may be called prudence; every virtue that causes the good \nof right and due in operation, be called justice; every virtue that curbs \nand represses the passions, be called temperance; and every virtue that \nstrengthens the mind against any passions whatever, be called fortitude. \nMany, both holy doctors, as also philosophers, speak about these virtues \nin this sense: and in this way the other virtues are contained under \nthem.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [3]), these four virtues are understood \ndifferently by various writers. For some take them as signifying certain \ngeneral conditions of the human mind, to be found in all the virtues: so \nthat, to wit, prudence is merely a certain rectitude of discretion in any \nactions or matters whatever; justice, a certain rectitude of the mind, \nwhereby a man does what he ought in any matters; temperance, a \ndisposition of the mind, moderating any passions or operations, so as to \nkeep them within bounds; and fortitude, a disposition whereby the soul is \nstrengthened for that which is in accord with reason, against any \nassaults of the passions, or the toil involved by any operations. To \ndistinguish these four virtues in this way does not imply that  justice, \ntemperance and fortitude are distinct virtuous habits: because it is \nfitting that every moral virtue, from the fact that it is a \"habit,\" \nshould be accompanied by a certain firmness so as not to be moved by its \ncontrary: and this, we have said, belongs to fortitude. Moreover, \ninasmuch as it is a \"virtue,\" it is directed to good which involves the \nnotion of right and due; and this, we have said, belongs to justice. \nAgain, owing to the fact that it is a \"moral virtue\" partaking of reason, \nit observes the mode of reason in all things, and does not exceed its \nbounds, which has been stated to belong to temperance. It is only in the \npoint of having discretion, which we ascribed to prudence, that there \nseems to be a distinction from the other three, inasmuch as discretion \nbelongs essentially to reason; whereas the other three imply a certain \nshare of reason by way of a kind of application (of reason) to passions \nor operations. According to the above explanation, then, prudence would \nbe distinct from the other three virtues: but these would not be distinct \nfrom one another; for it is evident that one and the same virtue is both \nhabit, and virtue, and moral virtue.\nOthers, however, with better reason, take these four virtues, according \nas they have their special determinate matter; each of its own matter, in \nwhich special commendation is given to that general condition from which \nthe virtue's name is taken as stated above (Article [3]).

Wherefore whoever \ncan curb his desires for the pleasures of touch, so that they keep within \nbounds, which is a very hard thing to do, for this very reason is more \nable to check his daring in dangers of death, so as not to go too far, \nwhich is much easier; and in this sense fortitude is said to be \ntemperate. Again, temperance is said to be brave, by reason of fortitude \noverflowing into temperance: in so far, to wit, as he whose mind is \nstrengthened by fortitude against dangers of death, which is a matter of \nvery great difficulty, is more able to remain firm against the onslaught \nof pleasures; for as Cicero says (De Offic. i), \"it would be inconsistent \nfor a man to be unbroken by fear, and yet vanquished by cupidity; or that \nhe should be conquered by lust, after showing himself to be unconquered \nby toil.\"\nFrom this the Reply to the Second Objection is clear.

Accordingly virtue may be considered as existing \noriginally in God, and thus we speak of \"exemplar\" virtues: so that in \nGod the Divine Mind itself may be called prudence; while temperance is \nthe turning of God's gaze on Himself, even as in us it is that which \nconforms the appetite to reason.

Now these virtues differ by reason of a difference of \nmovement and term: so that some are virtues of men who are on their way \nand tending towards the Divine similitude; and these are called \n\"perfecting\" virtues. Thus prudence, by contemplating the things of God, \ncounts as nothing all things of the world, and directs all the thoughts \nof the soul to God alone: temperance, so far as nature allows, neglects \nthe needs of the body; fortitude prevents the soul from being afraid of \nneglecting the body and rising to heavenly things; and justice consists \nin the soul giving a whole-hearted consent to follow the way thus \nproposed. Besides these there are the virtues of those who have already \nattained to the Divine similitude: these are called the \"perfect \nvirtues.\" Thus prudence sees nought else but the things of God; \ntemperance knows no earthly desires; fortitude has no knowledge of \npassion; and justice, by imitating the Divine Mind, is united thereto by \nan everlasting covenant.

Others held that forms are entirely from without, those, for \ninstance, who thought that corporeal forms originated from some separate \ncause. Others, however, esteemed that they are partly from within, in so \nfar as they pre-exist potentially in matter; and partly from without, in \nso far as they are brought into act by the agent.\nIn like manner with regard to sciences and virtues, some held that they \nare wholly from within, so that all virtues and sciences would pre-exist \nin the soul naturally, but that the hindrances to science and virtue, \nwhich are due to the soul being weighed down by the body, are removed by \nstudy and practice, even as iron is made bright by being polished. This \nwas the opinion of the Platonists. Others said that they are wholly from \nwithout, being due to the inflow of the active intellect, as Avicenna \nmaintained. Others said that sciences and virtues are within us by \nnature, so far as we are adapted to them, but not in their perfection: \nthis is the teaching of the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 1), and is nearer the \ntruth.\nTo make this clear, it must be observed that there are two ways in which \nsomething is said to be natural to a man; one is according to his \nspecific nature, the other according to his individual nature. And, since \neach thing derives its species from its form, and its individuation from \nmatter, and, again, since man's form is his rational soul, while his \nmatter is his body,  whatever belongs to him in respect of his rational \nsoul, is natural to him in respect of his specific nature; while whatever \nbelongs to him in respect of the particular temperament of his body, is \nnatural to him in respect of his individual nature. For whatever is \nnatural to man in respect of his body, considered as part of his species, \nis to be referred, in a way, to the soul, in so far as this particular \nbody is adapted to this particular soul.\nIn both these ways virtue is natural to man inchoatively. This is so in \nrespect of the specific nature, in so far as in man's reason are to be \nfound instilled by nature certain naturally known principles of both \nknowledge and action, which are the nurseries of intellectual and moral \nvirtues, and in so far as there is in the will a natural appetite for \ngood in accordance with reason. Again, this is so in respect of the \nindividual nature, in so far as by reason of a disposition in the body, \nsome are disposed either well or ill to certain virtues: because, to wit, \ncertain sensitive powers are acts of certain parts of the body, according \nto the disposition of which these powers are helped or hindered in the \nexercise of their acts, and, in consequence, the rational powers also, \nwhich the aforesaid sensitive powers assist. In this way one man has a \nnatural aptitude for science, another for fortitude, another for \ntemperance: and in these ways, both intellectual and moral virtues are in \nus by way of a natural aptitude, inchoatively, but not perfectly, since \nnature is determined to one, while the perfection of these virtues does \nnot depend on one particular mode of action, but on various modes, in \nrespect of the various matters, which constitute the sphere of virtue's \naction, and according to various circumstances.\nIt is therefore evident that all virtues are in us by nature, according \nto aptitude and inchoation, but not according to perfection, except the \ntheological virtues, which are entirely from without.\nThis suffices for the Replies to the Objections. For the first two argue \nabout the nurseries of virtue which are in us by nature, inasmuch as we \nare rational beings. The third objection must be taken in the sense that, \nowing to the natural disposition which the body has from birth, one has \nan aptitude for pity, another for living temperately, another for some \nother virtue."

Now it is evident \nthat the mean  that is appointed in such like concupiscences according to \nthe rule of human reason, is seen under a different aspect from the mean \nwhich is fixed according to Divine rule. For instance, in the consumption \nof food, the mean fixed by human reason, is that food should not harm the \nhealth of the body, nor hinder the use of reason: whereas, according to \nthe Divine rule, it behooves man to \"chastise his body, and bring it into \nsubjection\" (1 Cor. 9:27), by abstinence in food, drink and the like. It \nis therefore evident that infused and acquired temperance differ in \nspecies; and the same applies to the other virtues.\nThe other specific differences among habits is taken from the things to \nwhich they are directed: for a man's health and a horse's are not of the \nsame species, on account of the difference between the natures to which \ntheir respective healths are directed. In the same sense, the Philosopher \nsays (Polit. iii, 3) that citizens have diverse virtues according as they \nare well directed to diverse forms of government. In the same way, too, \nthose infused moral virtues, whereby men behave well in respect of their \nbeing \"fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household [Douay: \n'domestics'] of God\" (Eph. 2:19), differ from the acquired virtues, \nwhereby man behaves well in respect of human affairs.",

On the other hand, sometimes the rational mean is not the real \nmean, but is considered in relation to us: and such is the mean in all \nthe other moral virtues.

If \nwe take the moral virtues in this way, they are not connected: since we \nfind men who, by natural temperament or by being accustomed, are prompt \nin doing deeds of liberality, but are not prompt in doing deeds of \nchastity.\nBut the perfect moral virtue is a habit that inclines us to do a good \ndeed well; and if we take moral virtues in this way, we must say that \nthey are connected, as nearly as all are agreed in saying. For this two \nreasons are given, corresponding to the different ways of assigning the \ndistinction of the cardinal virtues. For, as we stated above (Question [61], Articles [3],4), some distinguish them according to certain general properties \nof the virtues: for instance, by saying that discretion belongs to \nprudence, rectitude to justice, moderation to temperance, and strength of \nmind to fortitude, in whatever matter we consider these properties to be. \nIn this way the reason for the connection is evident: for strength of \nmind is not commended as virtuous, if it be without moderation or \nrectitude or discretion: and so forth. This, too, is the reason assigned \nfor the connection by Gregory, who says (Moral. xxii, 1) that \"a virtue \ncannot be perfect\" as a virtue, \"if isolated from the others: for there \ncan be no true prudence without temperance, justice and fortitude\": and \nhe continues to speak in like manner of the other virtues (cf.

Augustine also gives the same reason  (De Trin. vi, 4).\nOthers, however, differentiate these virtues in respect of their \nmatters, and it is in this way that Aristotle assigns the reason for \ntheir connection (Ethic. vi, 13). Because, as stated above (Question [58], Article [4]), \nno moral virtue can be without prudence; since it is proper to moral \nvirtue to make a right choice, for it is an elective habit. Now right \nchoice requires not only the inclination to a due end, which inclination \nis the direct outcome of moral virtue, but also correct choice of things \nconducive to the end, which choice is made by prudence, that counsels, \njudges, and commands in those things that are directed to the end. In \nlike manner one cannot have prudence unless one has the moral virtues: \nsince prudence is \"right reason about things to be done,\" and the \nstarting point of reason is the end of the thing to be done, to which end \nman is rightly disposed by moral virtue.

Now for prudence to proceed aright, it is much more necessary \nthat man be well disposed towards his ultimate end, which is the effect \nof charity, than that he be well disposed in respect of other ends, which \nis the effect of moral virtue: just as in speculative matters right \nreason has greatest need of the first indemonstrable principle, that \n\"contradictories cannot both be true at the same time.\" It is therefore \nevident that neither can infused prudence be without charity; nor, \nconsequently, the other moral virtues, since they cannot be without \nprudence.\nIt is therefore clear from what has been said that only the infused \nvirtues are perfect, and deserve to be called virtues simply: since they \ndirect man well to the ultimate end. But the other virtues, those, \nnamely, that are acquired, are virtues in a restricted sense, but not \nsimply: for they direct man well in respect of the last end in some \nparticular genus of action, but not in respect of the last end simply. \nHence a gloss of Augustine [*Cf. Lib. Sentent. Prosperi cvi.] on the \nwords, \"All that is not of faith is sin\" (Rm. 14:23), says: \"He that \nfails to acknowledge the truth, has no true virtue, even if his conduct \nbe good.\"",

Now it is evident that charity, inasmuch as it directs man to his \nlast end, is the principle of all the good works that are referable to \nhis last end. Wherefore all the moral virtues must needs be infused \ntogether with charity, since it is through them that man performs each \ndifferent kind of good work.\nIt is therefore clear that the infused moral virtues are connected, not \nonly through prudence, but also on account of  charity: and, again, that \nwhoever loses charity through mortal sin, forfeits all the infused moral \nvirtues.",

        "ANS": "Faith and hope, like the moral virtues, can be considered \nin two ways; first in an inchoate state; secondly, as complete virtues. \nFor since virtue is directed to the doing of good works, perfect virtue \nis that which gives the faculty of doing a perfectly good work, and this \nconsists in not only doing what is good, but also in doing it well. Else, \nif what is done is good, but not well done, it will not be perfectly \ngood; wherefore neither will the habit that is the principle of such an \nact, have the perfect character of virtue. For instance, if a man do what \nis just, what he does is good: but it will not be the work of a perfect \nvirtue unless he do it well, i.e. by choosing rightly, which is the \nresult of prudence; for which reason justice cannot be a perfect virtue \nwithout prudence.\nAccordingly faith and hope can exist indeed in a fashion without \ncharity: but they have not the perfect character of virtue without \ncharity. For, since the act of faith is to believe in God; and since to \nbelieve is to assent to someone of one's own free will: to will not as \none ought, will not be a perfect act of faith. To will as one ought is \nthe outcome of charity which perfects the will: since every right \nmovement of the will proceeds from a right love, as Augustine says (De \nCiv. Dei xiv, 9). Hence faith may be without charity, but not as a \nperfect virtue: just as temperance and fortitude can be without prudence. \nThe same applies to hope. Because the act of hope consists in looking to \nGod for future bliss. This act is perfect, if it is based on the merits \nwhich we have; and this cannot be without charity. But to expect future \nbliss through merits which one has not yet, but which one proposes to \nacquire at some future time, will be an imperfect act; and this is \npossible without charity. Consequently, faith and hope can be without \ncharity; yet, without charity, they are not virtues properly so-called; \nbecause the nature of virtue requires that by it, we should not only do \nwhat is good, but also that we should do it well (Ethic. ii, 6).",

In this sense it is clear that one virtue \nis greater than another; since a cause is always more excellent than its \neffect; and among effects, those nearest to the cause are the most \nexcellent. Now it is clear from what has been said (Question [18], Article [5]; Question [61], Article [2]) that the cause and root of human good is the reason. Hence prudence \nwhich perfects the reason, surpasses in goodness the other moral virtues \nwhich perfect the appetitive power, in so far as it partakes of reason. \nAnd among these, one is better than another, according as it approaches  \nnearer to the reason. Consequently justice, which is in the will, excels \nthe remaining moral virtues; and fortitude, which is in the irascible \npart, stands before temperance, which is in the concupiscible, which has \na smaller share of reason, as stated in Ethic. vii, 6.\nThe question can be taken in another way, as referring to virtues of the \nsame species. In this way, according to what was said above (Question [52], Article [1]), when we were treating of the intensity of habits, virtue may be said \nto be greater or less in two ways: first, in itself; secondly with regard \nto the subject that partakes of it. If we consider it in itself, we shall \ncall it greater or little, according to the things to which it extends. \nNow whosoever has a virtue, e.g. temperance, has it in respect of \nwhatever temperance extends to. But this does not apply to science and \nart: for every grammarian does not know everything relating to grammar. \nAnd in this sense the Stoics said rightly, as Simplicius states in his \nCommentary on the Predicaments, that virtue cannot be more or less, as \nscience and art can; because the nature of virtue consists in a maximum.\nIf, however, we consider virtue on the part of the subject, it may then \nbe greater or less, either in relation to different times, or in \ndifferent men. Because one man is better disposed than another to attain \nto the mean of virtue which is defined by right reason; and this, on \naccount of either greater habituation, or a better natural disposition, \nor a more discerning judgment of reason, or again a greater gift of \ngrace, which is given to each one \"according to the measure of the giving \nof Christ,\" as stated in Eph. 4:9. And here the Stoics erred, for they \nheld that no man should be deemed virtuous, unless he were, in the \nhighest degree, disposed to virtue. Because the nature of virtue does not \nrequire that man should reach the mean of right reason as though it were \nan indivisible point, as the Stoics thought; but it is enough that he \nshould approach the mean, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6.

Secondly, it may be taken as referring to the degree of \nparticipation by the subject, according as a virtue becomes intense or \nremiss in its subject. In this sense all the virtues in one man are equal \nwith an equality of proportion, in so far as their growth in man is \nequal: thus the fingers are unequal in size, but equal in proportion, \nsince they grow in proportion to one another.\nNow the nature of this equality is to be explained in the same way as \nthe connection of virtues; for equality among virtues is their connection \nas to greatness. Now it has been stated above (Question [65], Article [1]) that a \ntwofold connection of virtues may be assigned. The first is according to \nthe opinion of those who understood these four virtues to be four general \nproperties of virtues, each of which is found together with the other in \nany matter. In this way virtues cannot be said to be equal in any matter \nunless they have all these properties equal. Augustine alludes to this \nkind of  equality (De Trin. vi, 4) when he says: \"If you say these men \nare equal in fortitude, but that one is more prudent than the other; it \nfollows that the fortitude of the latter is less prudent. Consequently \nthey are not really equal in fortitude, since the former's fortitude is \nmore prudent. You will find that this applies to the other virtues if you \nrun over them all in the same way.\"\nThe other kind of connection among virtues followed the opinion of those \nwho hold these virtues to have their own proper respective matters (Question [65], Articles [1],2). In this way the connection among moral virtues results from \nprudence, and, as to the infused virtues, from charity, and not from the \ninclination, which is on the part of the subject, as stated above (Question [65], Article [1]). Accordingly the nature of the equality among virtues can also be \nconsidered on the part of prudence, in regard to that which is formal in \nall the moral virtues: for in one and the same man, so long as his reason \nhas the same degree of perfection, the mean will be proportionately \ndefined according to right reason in each matter of virtue.\nBut in regard to that which is material in the moral virtues, viz. the \ninclination to the virtuous act, one may be readier to perform the act of \none virtue, than the act of another virtue, and this either from nature, \nor from habituation, or again by the grace of God.",

Hence the brave man \nand the just  man are honored more than others; because the former,\" i.e. \nfortitude, \"is useful in war, and the latter,\" i.e. justice, \"both in war \nand in peace.\" After fortitude comes temperance, which subjects the \nappetite to reason in matters directly relating to life, in the one \nindividual, or in the one species, viz. in matters of food and of sex. \nAnd so these three virtues, together with prudence, are called principal \nvirtues, in excellence also.\nA virtue is said to be greater relatively, by reason of its helping or \nadorning a principal virtue: even as substance is more excellent simply \nthan accident: and yet relatively some particular accident is more \nexcellent than substance in so far as it perfects substance in some \naccidental mode of being.",
        "RP1": "The act of liberality needs to be founded on an act of \njustice, for \"a man is not liberal in giving, unless he gives of his own\" \n(Polit. ii, 3). Hence there could be no liberality apart from justice, \nwhich discerns between \"meum\" and \"tuum\": whereas justice can be without \nliberality. Hence justice is simply greater than liberality, as being \nmore universal, and as being its foundation: while liberality is greater \nrelatively since it is an ornament and an addition to justice.",
        "RP2": "Patience is said to have \"a perfect work,\" by enduring \nevils, wherein it excludes not only unjust revenge, which is also \nexcluded by justice; not only hatred, which is also suppressed by \ncharity; nor only anger, which is calmed by gentleness; but also \ninordinate sorrow, which is the root of all the above. Wherefore it is \nmore perfect and excellent through plucking up the root in this matter. \nIt is not, however, more perfect than all the other virtues simply. \nBecause fortitude not only endures trouble without being disturbed, but \nalso fights against it if necessary. Hence whoever is brave is patient; \nbut the converse does not hold, for patience is a part of fortitude.",
        "RP3": "There can be no magnanimity without the other virtues, as \nstated in Ethic. iv, 3. Hence it is compared to them as their ornament, \nso that relatively it is greater than all the others, but not simply."

But a virtue which is less certain about a higher and \nbetter object, is preferable to that which is more certain about an \nobject of inferior degree. Wherefore the Philosopher says (De Coelo ii, \ntext. 60) that \"it is a great thing to be able to know something about \ncelestial beings, though it be based on weak and probable reasoning\"; and \nagain (De Part. Animal. i, 5) that \"it is better to know a little about \nsublime things, than much about mean things.\" Accordingly wisdom, to \nwhich knowledge about God pertains, is beyond the reach of man, \nespecially in this life, so as to be his possession: for this \"belongs to \nGod alone\" (Metaph. i, 2): and yet this little knowledge about God which \nwe can have through wisdom is preferable to all other knowledge.",

Now to know the meaning of being and non-being, of whole \nand part, and of other things consequent to being, which are the terms \nwhereof indemonstrable principles are constituted, is the function of \nwisdom: since universal being is the proper effect of the Supreme Cause, \nwhich is God. And so wisdom makes use of indemonstrable principles which \nare the object of understanding, not only by drawing conclusions from \nthem, as other sciences do, but also by passing its judgment on them, and \nby vindicating them against those who deny them.

The material element \nin these virtues is a certain inclination of the appetitive part to the \npassions and operations according to a certain mode: and since this mode \nis fixed by reason, the formal element is precisely this order of reason.\nAccordingly we must say that these moral virtues do not remain in the \nfuture life, as regards their material element. For in the future life \nthere will be no concupiscences and pleasures in matters of food and sex; \nnor fear and daring about dangers of death; nor distributions and \ncommutations of things employed in  this present life.

In others we find \nopposition in respect of perfection and imperfection: wherefore in \nalterations, more and less are considered to be contraries, as when a \nthing from being less hot is made more hot (Phys. v, text. 19). And since \nperfect and imperfect are opposite to one another, it is impossible for \nperfection and imperfection to affect the same thing at the same time.\nNow we must take note that sometimes imperfection belongs to a thing's \nvery nature, and belongs to its species: even as lack of reason belongs \nto the very specific nature of a horse and an ox. And since a thing, so \nlong as it remains the same identically, cannot pass from one species to \nanother, it follows that if such an imperfection be removed, the species \nof that thing is changed: even as it would no longer be an ox or a horse, \nwere it to be rational. Sometimes, however, the imperfection does not \nbelong to the specific nature, but is accidental to the individual by \nreason of something else; even as sometimes lack of reason is accidental \nto a man, because he is asleep, or because he is drunk, or for some like \nreason; and it is evident, that if such an imperfection be removed, the \nthing remains substantially.\nNow it is clear that imperfect knowledge belongs to the very nature of \nfaith: for it is included in its definition; faith being defined as \"the \nsubstance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear \nnot\" (Heb. 11:1). Wherefore Augustine says (Tract. xl in Joan.): \"Where \nis faith? Believing without seeing.\" But it is an imperfect knowledge \nthat is of things unapparent or unseen. Consequently imperfect knowledge \nbelongs to the very nature of faith: therefore it is clear that the \nknowledge of faith cannot be perfect and remain identically the same.\nBut we must also consider whether it is compatible with perfect \nknowledge: for there is nothing to prevent some kind of imperfect \nknowledge from being sometimes with perfect knowledge. Accordingly we \nmust observe that knowledge can be imperfect in three ways: first, on the \npart of the knowable object; secondly, on the part of the medium; \nthirdly, on the part of the subject. The difference of perfect and \nimperfect knowledge on the part of the knowable object is seen in the \n\"morning\" and \"evening\" knowledge of the angels: for the \"morning\" \nknowledge is about things according to the being which they have in the \nWord, while the \"evening\" knowledge is about things according as they \nhave being in their own natures, which being is imperfect in comparison \nwith the First Being. On the part of the medium, perfect and imperfect \nknowledge are exemplified in the knowledge of a conclusion through a \ndemonstrative medium, and through a probable medium. On the part of the \nsubject the difference of perfect and imperfect knowledge applies to \nopinion, faith, and science. For it is essential to opinion that we \nassent to one of two opposite assertions with fear of the other, so that \nour adhesion is not firm: to science it is essential to have firm \nadhesion with intellectual vision, for science possesses certitude which \nresults from the understanding of principles: while faith holds a middle \nplace, for it surpasses opinion in so far as its adhesion is firm, but \nfalls short of  science in so far as it lacks vision.\nNow it is evident that a thing cannot be perfect and imperfect in the \nsame respect; yet the things which differ as perfect and imperfect can be \ntogether in the same respect in one and the same other thing. \nAccordingly, knowledge which is perfect on the part of the object is \nquite incompatible with imperfect knowledge about the same object; but \nthey are compatible with one another in respect of the same medium or the \nsame subject: for nothing hinders a man from having at one and the same \ntime, through one and the same medium, perfect and imperfect knowledge \nabout two things, one perfect, the other imperfect, e.g. about health and \nsickness, good and evil. In like manner knowledge that is perfect on the \npart of the medium is incompatible with imperfect knowledge through one \nand the same medium: but nothing hinders them being about the same \nsubject or in the same subject: for one man can know the same conclusions \nthrough a probable and through a demonstrative medium. Again, knowledge \nthat is perfect on the part of the subject is incompatible with imperfect \nknowledge in the same subject. Now faith, of its very nature, contains an \nimperfection on the part of the subject, viz. that the believer sees not \nwhat he believes: whereas bliss, of its very nature, implies perfection \non the part of the subject, viz. that the Blessed see that which makes \nthem happy, as stated above (Question [3], Article [8]).

And if this be \nunderstood to mean that it remains the same, not identically but \ngenerically, it is absolutely true; since faith is of the same genus, \nviz. knowledge, as the beatific vision. On the other hand, hope is not of \nthe same genus as heavenly bliss: because it is compared to the enjoyment \nof bliss, as movement is to rest in the term of movement.\nBut if it be understood to mean that in heaven the knowledge of faith \nremains identically the same, this is absolutely impossible. Because when \nyou remove a specific difference, the substance of the genus does not \nremain identically the same: thus if you remove the difference \nconstituting whiteness, the substance of color does not remain \nidentically the same, as though the identical color were at one time \nwhiteness, and, at another, blackness. The reason is that genus is not \nrelated to difference as matter to form, so that the substance of the \ngenus remains identically the same, when the difference is removed, as \nthe substance of matter remains identically the same, when the form is \nchanged: for genus and difference are not the parts of a species, else \nthey would not be predicated of the species. But even as the species \ndenotes the whole, i.e. the compound of matter and form in material \nthings, so does the difference, and likewise the genus; the genus denotes \nthe whole by signifying that which is material; the difference, by \nsignifying that which is formal; the species, by signifying both. Thus, \nin man, the sensitive nature is as matter to the intellectual nature, and \nanimal is predicated of that which has a sensitive nature, rational of \nthat which has an intellectual nature, and man of that which has both. So \nthat the one same whole is denoted by these three, but not under the same \naspect.\nIt is therefore evident that, since the signification of the difference \nis confined to the genus if the difference be removed, the substance of \nthe genus cannot remain the same: for the same animal nature does not \nremain, if another kind of soul constitute the animal. Hence it is \nimpossible for the identical knowledge, which was previously obscure, to \nbecome clear vision.

        "ANS": "If we speak of gift and virtue with regard to the notion \nconveyed by the words themselves, there is no opposition between them. \nBecause the word \"virtue\" conveys the notion that it perfects man in \nrelation to well-doing, while the word \"gift\" refers to the cause from \nwhich it proceeds. Now there is no reason why that which proceeds from \none as a gift should not perfect another in well-doing: especially as we \nhave already stated (Question [63], Article [3]) that some virtues are infused into us \nby God. Wherefore in this respect we cannot differentiate gifts from \nvirtues. Consequently some have held that the gifts are not to be \ndistinguished from the virtues. But there remains no less a difficulty \nfor them to solve; for they must explain why some virtues are called \ngifts and some not; and why among the gifts there are some, fear, for \ninstance, that are not reckoned virtues.\nHence it is that others have said that the gifts should be held as being \ndistinct from the virtues; yet they have not assigned a suitable reason \nfor this distinction, a reason, to wit, which would apply either to all \nthe virtues, and to none of the gifts, or vice versa. For, seeing that of \nthe seven gifts, four belong to the reason, viz. wisdom, knowledge, \nunderstanding and counsel, and three to the appetite, viz. fortitude, \npiety and fear; they held that the gifts perfect the free-will according \nas it is a faculty of the reason, while the virtues perfect it as a \nfaculty of the will: since they observed only two virtues in the reason \nor intellect, viz. faith and prudence, the others being in the appetitive \npower or the affections. If this distinction were true, all the virtues \nwould have to be in the appetite, and all the gifts in the reason.\nOthers observing that Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that \"the gift of the \nHoly Ghost, by coming into the soul endows it with prudence, temperance, \njustice, and fortitude, and at the same time strengthens it against every \nkind of temptation by His sevenfold gift,\" said that the virtues are \ngiven us that we may do good works, and the gifts, that we may resist \ntemptation. But neither is this distinction sufficient. Because the \nvirtues also resist those temptations which lead to the sins that are \ncontrary to the virtues; for everything naturally resists its contrary: \nwhich is especially clear with regard to charity, of which it is written \n(Cant 8:7): \"Many waters cannot quench charity.\"\nOthers again, seeing that these gifts are set down in Holy Writ as \nhaving been in Christ, according to Is. 11:2,3, said that the virtues are \ngiven simply that we may do good works, but the gifts, in order to \nconform us to Christ, chiefly with regard to His Passion, for it was then \nthat these gifts shone with the greatest splendor. Yet neither does this \nappear to be a satisfactory distinction. Because Our Lord Himself wished \nus to be conformed to Him, chiefly in humility and meekness, according to \nMt. 11:29: \"Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart,\" and in  \ncharity, according to Jn. 15:12: \"Love one another, as I have loved you.\" \nMoreover, these virtues were especially resplendent in Christ's Passion.\nAccordingly, in order to differentiate the gifts from the virtues, we \nmust be guided by the way in which Scripture expresses itself, for we \nfind there that the term employed is \"spirit\" rather than \"gift.\" For \nthus it is written (Is. 11:2,3): \"The spirit . . . of wisdom and of \nunderstanding . . . shall rest upon him,\" etc.: from which words we are \nclearly given to understand that these seven are there set down as being \nin us by Divine inspiration. Now inspiration denotes motion from without. \nFor it must be noted that in man there is a twofold principle of \nmovement, one within him, viz. the reason; the other extrinsic to him, \nviz. God, as stated above (Question [9], Articles [4],6): moreover the Philosopher says \nthis in the chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem. vii, 8).\nNow it is evident that whatever is moved must be proportionate to its \nmover: and the perfection of the mobile as such, consists in a \ndisposition whereby it is disposed to be well moved by its mover. Hence \nthe more exalted the mover, the more perfect must be the disposition \nwhereby the mobile is made proportionate to its mover: thus we see that a \ndisciple needs a more perfect disposition in order to receive a higher \nteaching from his master. Now it is manifest that human virtues perfect \nman according as it is natural for him to be moved by his reason in his \ninterior and exterior actions. Consequently man needs yet higher \nperfections, whereby to be disposed to be moved by God. These perfections \nare called gifts, not only because they are infused by God, but also \nbecause by them man is disposed to become amenable to the Divine \ninspiration, according to Is. 50:5: \"The Lord . . . hath opened my ear, \nand I do not resist; I have not gone back.\" Even the Philosopher says in \nthe chapter On Good Fortune (Ethic. Eudem., vii, 8) that for those who \nare moved by Divine instinct, there is no need to take counsel according \nto human reason, but only to follow their inner promptings, since they \nare moved by a principle higher than human reason.

For it is one thing to hope that the tree \nwill bear fruit, when the leaves begin to appear, and another, when we \nsee the first signs of the fruit.\nAccordingly, those things which are set down as merits in the \nbeatitudes, are a kind of preparation for, or disposition to happiness, \neither perfect or inchoate: while those that are assigned as rewards, may \nbe either perfect happiness, so as to refer to the future life, or some \nbeginning of happiness, such as is found in those who have attained \nperfection, in which case they refer to the present life. Because when a \nman begins to make progress in the acts of the virtues and gifts, it is \nto be hoped that he will arrive at perfection, both as a wayfarer, and as \na citizen of the heavenly kingdom.",
        "RP1": "Hope regards future happiness as the last end: yet it may \nalso regard the assistance of grace as that which leads to that end, \naccording to Ps. 27:7: \"In Him hath my heart hoped, and I have been \nhelped.\"",
        "RP2": "Although sometimes the wicked do not undergo temporal \npunishment in this life, yet they suffer spiritual punishment. Hence \nAugustine says (Confess. i): \"Thou hast decreed, and it is so, \nLord---that the disordered mind should be its own punishment.\" The \nPhilosopher, too, says of the wicked (Ethic. ix, 4) that \"their soul is \ndivided against itself . . . one part pulls this way, another that\"; and \nafterwards he concludes, saying: \"If wickedness makes a man so miserable, \nhe should strain every nerve to avoid vice.\" In like manner, although, on \nthe other hand, the good sometimes do not receive material rewards in \nthis life, yet they never lack spiritual rewards, even in this life, \naccording to Mt. 19:29, and Mk. 10:30: \"Ye shall receive a hundred times \nas much\" even \"in this time.\"",
        "RP3": "All these rewards will be fully consummated in the life to \ncome: but meanwhile they are, in a manner, begun, even in this life. \nBecause the \"kingdom of heaven,\" as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv; *Cf. \nDe Serm. Dom. in Monte, i, 1), can denote the beginning of perfect \nwisdom, in so far as \"the spirit\" begins to reign in men. The \n\"possession\" of the land denotes the well-ordered affections of the soul \nthat rests, by its desire, on the solid foundation of the eternal \ninheritance, signified by \"the land.\" They are \"comforted\" in this life, \nby receiving the Holy Ghost, Who is called the \"Paraclete,\" i.e. the \nComforter. They  \"have their fill,\" even in this life, of that food of \nwhich Our Lord said (Jn. 4:34): \"My meat is to do the will of Him that \nsent Me.\" Again, in this life, men \"obtain\" God's \"Mercy.\" Again, the eye \nbeing cleansed by the gift of understanding, we can, so to speak, \"see \nGod.\" Likewise, in this life, those who are the \"peacemakers\" of their \nown movements, approach to likeness to God, and are called \"the children \nof God.\" Nevertheless these things will be more perfectly fulfilled in \nheaven."

        "question": "Whether the beatitudes are suitably enumerated?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that the beatitudes are unsuitably enumerated. For \nthe beatitudes are assigned to the gifts, as stated above (Article [1], ad 1). \nNow some of the gifts, viz. wisdom and understanding, belong to the \ncontemplative life: yet no beatitude is assigned to the act of \ncontemplation, for all are assigned to matters connected with the active \nlife. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently enumerated.",
        "OB2": "Further, not only do the executive gifts belong to the active \nlife, but also some of the directive gifts, e.g. knowledge and counsel: \nyet none of the beatitudes seems to be directly connected with the acts \nof knowledge or counsel. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently \nindicated.",
        "OB3": "Further, among the executive gifts connected with the active \nlife, fear is said to be connected with poverty, while piety seems to \ncorrespond to the beatitude of mercy: yet nothing is included directly \nconnected with justice. Therefore the beatitudes are insufficiently \nenumerated.",
        "OB4": "Further, many other beatitudes are mentioned in Holy Writ. Thus, \nit is written (Job 5:17): \"Blessed is the man whom God correcteth\"; and \n(Ps. i, 1): \"Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the \nungodly\"; and (Prov. 3:13): \"Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom.\" \nTherefore the beatitudes are insufficiently enumerated.",
        "OB5": "On the other hand, it seems that too many are mentioned. For \nthere are seven gifts of the Holy Ghost: whereas eight beatitudes are \nindicated.\nObjection 6: Further, only four beatitudes are indicated in the sixth chapter \nof Luke. Therefore the seven or eight mentioned in Matthew 5 are too many.\nReply to  The eighth beatitude is a confirmation and declaration of \nall those that precede. Because from the very fact that a man is \nconfirmed in poverty of spirit, meekness, and the rest, it follows that \nno persecution will induce him to renounce them. Hence the eighth \nbeatitude corresponds, in a way, to all the preceding seven.\nReply to Objection 6: Luke relates Our Lord's sermon as addressed to the \nmultitude (Lk. 6:17). Hence he sets down the beatitudes according to the \ncapacity of the multitude, who know no other happiness than pleasure, \ntemporal and earthly: wherefore by these four beatitudes Our Lord \nexcludes four things which seem to belong to such happiness. The first of \nthese is abundance of external goods, which he sets aside by saying: \n\"Blessed are ye poor.\" The second is that man be well off as to his body, \nin food and drink, and so forth; this he excludes by saying in the second \nplace: \"Blessed are ye that hunger.\" The third is that it should be well \nwith man as to joyfulness of heart, and this he puts aside by saying: \n\"Blessed are ye that weep now.\" The fourth is the outward favor of man; \nand this he excludes, saying, fourthly: \"Blessed shall you be, when men \nshall hate you.\" And as Ambrose says on Lk. 6:20, \"poverty corresponds to \ntemperance, which is unmoved by delights; hunger, to justice, since who \nhungers is compassionate and, through compassion gives; mourning, to \nprudence, which deplores perishable things; endurance of men's hatred \nbelongs to fortitude.\"",
        "ANS": "These beatitudes are most suitably enumerated. To make \nthis evident it must be observed that beatitude has been held to consist \nin one of three things: for some have ascribed it to a sensual life, \nsome, to an active life, and some, to a contemplative life [*See Question [3]]. \nNow these three kinds of happiness stand in different relations to future \nbeatitude, by hoping for which we are said to be happy. Because sensual \nhappiness, being  false and contrary to reason, is an obstacle to future \nbeatitude; while happiness of the active life is a disposition of future \nbeatitude; and contemplative happiness, if perfect, is the very essence \nof future beatitude, and, if imperfect, is a beginning thereof.\nAnd so Our Lord, in the first place, indicated certain beatitudes as \nremoving the obstacle of sensual happiness. For a life of pleasure \nconsists of two things. First, in the affluence of external goods, \nwhether riches or honors; from which man is withdrawn---by a virtue so \nthat he uses them in moderation---and by a gift, in a more excellent way, \nso that he despises them altogether. Hence the first beatitude is: \n\"Blessed are the poor in spirit,\" which may refer either to the contempt \nof riches, or to the contempt of honors, which results from humility. \nSecondly, the sensual life consists in following the bent of one's \npassions, whether irascible or concupiscible. From following the \nirascible passions man is withdrawn---by a virtue, so that they are kept \nwithin the bounds appointed by the ruling of reason---and by a gift, in a \nmore excellent manner, so that man, according to God's will, is \naltogether undisturbed by them: hence the second beatitude is: \"Blessed \nare the meek.\" From following the concupiscible passions, man is \nwithdrawn---by a virtue, so that man uses these passions in \nmoderation---and by gift, so that, if necessary, he casts them aside \naltogether; nay more, so that, if need be, he makes a deliberate choice \nof sorrow [*Cf. Question [35], Article [3]]; hence the third beatitude is: \"Blessed are \nthey that mourn.\"\nActive life consists chiefly in man's relations with his neighbor, \neither by way of duty or by way of spontaneous gratuity. To the former we \nare disposed---by a virtue, so that we do not refuse to do our duty to \nour neighbor, which pertains to justice---and by a gift, so that we do \nthe same much more heartily, by accomplishing works of justice with an \nardent desire, even as a hungry and thirsty man eats and drinks with \neager appetite. Hence the fourth beatitude is: \"Blessed are they that \nhunger and thirst after justice.\" With regard to spontaneous favors we \nare perfected---by a virtue, so that we give where reason dictates we \nshould give, e.g. to our friends or others united to us; which pertains \nto the virtue of liberality--and by a gift, so that, through reverence \nfor God, we consider only the needs of those on whom we bestow our \ngratuitous bounty: hence it is written (Lk. 14:12,13): \"When thou makest \na dinner or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,\" etc . . . \n\"but . . . call the poor, the maimed,\" etc.; which, properly, is to have \nmercy: hence the fifth beatitude is: \"Blessed are the merciful.\"\nThose things which concern the contemplative life, are either final \nbeatitude itself, or some beginning thereof: wherefore they are included \nin the beatitudes, not as merits, but as rewards. Yet the effects of the \nactive life, which dispose man for the contemplative life, are included \nin the beatitudes. Now the effect of the active life, as regards those \nvirtues and gifts whereby man is perfected in himself, is the cleansing \nof man's heart, so that  it is not defiled by the passions: hence the \nsixth beatitude is: \"Blessed are the clean of heart.\" But as regards the \nvirtues and gifts whereby man is perfected in relation to his neighbor, \nthe effect of the active life is peace, according to Is. 32:17: \"The work \nof justice shall be peace\": hence the seventh beatitude is \"Blessed are \nthe peacemakers.\"",
        "RP1": "The acts of the gifts which belong to the active life are \nindicated in the merits: but the acts of the gifts pertaining to the \ncontemplative life are indicated in the rewards, for the reason given \nabove. Because to \"see God\" corresponds to the gift of understanding; and \nto be like God by being adoptive \"children of God,\" corresponds to the \ngift of wisdom.",
        "RP2": "In things pertaining to the active life, knowledge is not \nsought for its own sake, but for the sake of operation, as even the \nPhilosopher states (Ethic. ii, 2). And therefore, since beatitude implies \nsomething ultimate, the beatitudes do not include the acts of those gifts \nwhich direct man in the active life, such acts, to wit, as are elicited \nby those gifts, as, e.g. to counsel is the act of counsel, and to judge, \nthe act of knowledge: but, on the other hand, they include those \noperative acts of which the gifts have the direction, as, e.g. mourning \nin respect of knowledge, and mercy in respect of counsel.",
        "RP3": "In applying the beatitudes to the gifts we may consider two \nthings. One is likeness of matter. In this way all the first five \nbeatitudes may be assigned to knowledge and counsel as to their directing \nprinciples: whereas they must be distributed among the executive gifts: \nso that, to wit, hunger and thirst for justice, and mercy too, correspond \nto piety, which perfects man in his relations to others; meekness to \nfortitude, for Ambrose says on Lk. 6:22: \"It is the business of fortitude \nto conquer anger, and to curb indignation,\" fortitude being about the \nirascible passions: poverty and mourning to the gift of fear, whereby man \nwithdraws from the lusts and pleasures of the world.\nSecondly, we may consider the motives of the beatitudes: and, in this \nway, some of them will have to be assigned differently. Because the \nprincipal motive for meekness is reverence for God, which belongs to \npiety. The chief motive for mourning is knowledge, whereby man knows his \nfailings and those of worldly things, according to Eccles. 1:18: \"He that \naddeth knowledge, addeth also sorrow [Vulg: labor].\" The principal motive \nfor hungering after the works of justice is fortitude of the soul: and \nthe chief motive for being merciful is God's counsel, according to Dan. \n4:24: \"Let my counsel be acceptable to the king [Vulg: to thee, O king]: \nand redeem thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of \nmercy to the poor.\" It is thus that Augustine assigns them (De Serm. Dom. \nin Monte i, 4).",
        "RP4": "All the beatitudes mentioned in Holy Writ must be reduced \nto these, either as to the merits or as to the rewards: because they must \nall belong either to the active or to the  contemplative life. \nAccordingly, when we read, \"Blessed is the man whom the Lord correcteth,\" \nwe must refer this to the beatitude of mourning: when we read, \"Blessed \nis the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,\" we must \nrefer it to cleanness of heart: and when we read, \"Blessed is the man \nthat findeth wisdom,\" this must be referred to the reward of the seventh \nbeatitude. The same applies to all others that can be adduced."

        "OB3": "Further, the beatitudes are arranged in the ascending order, as \nAugustine remarks (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): whereas the rewards seem \nto be placed in the descending order, since to \"possess the land\" is less \nthan to possess \"the kingdom of heaven.\" Therefore these rewards are \nunsuitably enumerated.",
        "CON": "stands the authority of Our Lord Who  propounded these \nrewards.",
        "ANS": "These rewards are most suitably assigned, considering the \nnature of the beatitudes in relation to the three kinds of happiness \nindicated above (Article [3]). For the first three beatitudes concerned the \nwithdrawal of man from those things in which sensual happiness consists: \nwhich happiness man desires by seeking the object of his natural desire, \nnot where he should seek it, viz. in God, but in temporal and perishable \nthings. Wherefore the rewards of the first three beatitudes correspond to \nthese things which some men seek to find in earthly happiness. For men \nseek in external things, viz. riches and honors, a certain excellence and \nabundance, both of which are implied in the kingdom of heaven, whereby \nman attains to excellence and abundance of good things in God. Hence Our \nLord promised the kingdom of heaven to the poor in spirit. Again, cruel \nand pitiless men seek by wrangling and fighting to destroy their enemies \nso as to gain security for themselves. Hence Our Lord promised the meek a \nsecure and peaceful possession of the land of the living, whereby the \nsolid reality of eternal goods is denoted. Again, men seek consolation \nfor the toils of the present life, in the lusts and pleasures of the \nworld. Hence Our Lord promises comfort to those that mourn.\nTwo other beatitudes belong to the works of active happiness, which are \nthe works of virtues directing man in his relations to his neighbor: from \nwhich operations some men withdraw through inordinate love of their own \ngood. Hence Our Lord assigns to these beatitudes rewards in \ncorrespondence with the motives for which men recede from them. For there \nare some who recede from acts of justice, and instead of rendering what \nis due, lay hands on what is not theirs, that they may abound in temporal \ngoods. Wherefore Our Lord promised those who hunger after justice, that \nthey shall have their fill. Some, again, recede from works of mercy, lest \nthey be busied with other people's misery. Hence Our Lord promised the \nmerciful that they should obtain mercy, and be delivered from all misery.\nThe last two beatitudes belong to contemplative happiness or beatitude: \nhence the rewards are assigned in correspondence with the dispositions \nincluded in the merit. For cleanness of the eye disposes one to see \nclearly: hence the clean of heart are promised that they shall see God. \nAgain, to make peace either in oneself or among others, shows a man to be \na follower of God, Who is the God of unity and peace. Hence, as a reward, \nhe is promised the glory of the Divine sonship, consisting in perfect \nunion with God through consummate wisdom.",
        "RP1": "As Chrysostom says (Hom. xv in Matth.), all these rewards \nare one in reality, viz. eternal happiness, which the human intellect \ncannot grasp. Hence it was necessary to describe it by means of various \nboons known to us, while observing due proportion to the merits to which \nthose rewards are assigned.",
        "RP2": "Just as the eighth beatitude is a confirmation of  all the \nbeatitudes, so it deserves all the rewards of the beatitudes. Hence it \nreturns to the first, that we may understand all the other rewards to be \nattributed to it in consequence. Or else, according to Ambrose (Super \nLuc. v), the kingdom of heaven is promised to the poor in spirit, as \nregards the glory of the soul; but to those who suffer persecution in \ntheir bodies, it is promised as regards the glory of the body.",
        "RP3": "The rewards are also arranged in ascending order. For it is \nmore to possess the land of the heavenly kingdom than simply to have it: \nsince we have many things without possessing them firmly and peacefully. \nAgain, it is more to be comforted in the kingdom than to have and possess \nit, for there are many things the possession of which is accompanied by \nsorrow. Again, it is more to have one's fill than simply to be comforted, \nbecause fulness implies abundance of comfort. And mercy surpasses \nsatiety, for thereby man receives more than he merited or was able to \ndesire. And yet more is it to see God, even as he is a greater man who \nnot only dines at court, but also sees the king's countenance. Lastly, \nthe highest place in the royal palace belongs to the king's son."

Now fruit, among material things, is the product \nof a plant when it comes to perfection, and has a certain sweetness. This \nfruit has a twofold relation: to the tree that produces it, and to the \nman who gathers the fruit from the tree. Accordingly, in spiritual \nmatters, we may take the word \"fruit\" in two ways: first, so that the \nfruit of man, who is likened to the tree, is that which he produces; \nsecondly, so that man's fruit is what he gathers.\nYet not all that man gathers is fruit, but only that which is last and \ngives pleasure. For a man has both a field and a tree, and yet these are \nnot called fruits; but that only which is last, to wit, that which man \nintends to derive from the field and from the tree. In this sense man's \nfruit is his last end which is intended for his enjoyment.\nIf, however, by man's fruit we understand a product of man, then human \nactions are called fruits: because operation is the second act of the \noperator, and gives pleasure if it is suitable to him. If then man's \noperation proceeds from man in virtue of his reason, it is said to be the \nfruit of his reason: but if it proceeds from him in respect of a higher \npower, which is the power of the Holy Ghost, then man's operation is said \nto be the fruit of the Holy Ghost, as of a Divine seed, for it is written \n(1 Jn. 3:9): \"Whosoever is born of God, committeth no sin, for His seed \nabideth in him.\"",
        "RP1": "Since fruit is something last and final, nothing hinders \none fruit bearing another fruit, even as one end is subordinate to \nanother. And so our works, in so far as they are produced by the Holy \nGhost working in us, are fruits: but, in so far as they are referred to \nthe end which is eternal life, they should rather be called flowers: \nhence it is written (Ecclus. 24:23): \"My flowers are the fruits of honor \nand riches.\"",
        "RP2": "When the will is said to delight in a thing for its own \nsake, this may be understood in two ways. First, so that the expression \n\"for the sake of\" be taken to designate the final cause; and in this way, \nman delights in nothing for its own sake, except the last end. Secondly, \nso that it expresses the formal cause; and in this way, a man may delight \nin anything that is delightful by reason of its form. Thus it is clear \nthat a sick man delights in health, for its own sake, as in an end; in a \nnice medicine, not as in an end, but as in something tasty; and in a \nnasty medicine, nowise for its own sake, but only for the sake of \nsomething else. Accordingly we must say that man must delight in God for \nHis own sake, as being his last end, and in virtuous deeds, not as being \nhis end, but for the sake of their inherent goodness which is delightful \nto the virtuous. Hence Ambrose says (De Parad.  xiii) that virtuous deeds \nare called fruits because \"they refresh those that have them, with a holy \nand genuine delight.\"",

        "ANS": "The number of the twelve fruits enumerated by the Apostle \nis suitable, and that there may be a reference to them in the twelve \nfruits of which it is written (Apoc. 22:2): \"On both sides of the river \nwas the tree bearing twelve fruits.\" Since, however, a fruit is something \nthat proceeds from a source as from a seed or root, the difference \nbetween these fruits must be gathered from the various ways in which the \nHoly Ghost proceeds in us: which process consists in this, that the mind \nof man is set in order, first of all, in regard to itself; secondly, in \nregard to things that are near it; thirdly, in regard to things that are \nbelow it.\nAccordingly man's mind is well disposed in regard to itself when it has \na good disposition towards good things and towards evil things. Now the \nfirst disposition of the human mind towards the good is effected by love, \nwhich is the first of our emotions and the root of them all, as stated \nabove (Question [27], Article [4]). Wherefore among the fruits of the Holy Ghost, we \nreckon \"charity,\" wherein the Holy Ghost is given in a special manner, as \nin His own likeness, since He Himself is love. Hence it is written (Rm. 5:5): \"The charity of  God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy \nGhost, Who is given to us.\" The necessary result of the love of charity \nis joy: because every lover rejoices at being united to the beloved. Now \ncharity has always actual presence in God Whom it loves, according to 1 \nJn. 4:16: \"He that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in Him\": \nwherefore the sequel of charity is \"joy.\" Now the perfection of joy is \npeace in two respects. First, as regards freedom from outward \ndisturbance; for it is impossible to rejoice perfectly in the beloved \ngood, if one is disturbed in the enjoyment thereof; and again, if a man's \nheart is perfectly set at peace in one object, he cannot be disquieted by \nany other, since he accounts all others as nothing; hence it is written \n(Ps. 118:165): \"Much peace have they that love Thy Law, and to them there \nis no stumbling-block,\" because, to wit, external things do not disturb \nthem in their enjoyment of God. Secondly, as regards the calm of the \nrestless desire: for he does not perfectly rejoice, who is not satisfied \nwith the object of his joy. Now peace implies these two things, namely, \nthat we be not disturbed by external things, and that our desires rest \naltogether in one object. Wherefore after charity and joy, \"peace\" is \ngiven the third place. In evil things the mind has a good disposition, in \nrespect of two things. First, by not being disturbed whenever evil \nthreatens: which pertains to \"patience\"; secondly, by not being \ndisturbed, whenever good things are delayed; which belongs to \"long \nsuffering,\" since \"to lack good is a kind of evil\" (Ethic. v, 3).\nMan's mind is well disposed as regards what is near him, viz. his \nneighbor, first, as to the will to do good; and to this belongs \n\"goodness.\" Secondly, as to the execution of well-doing; and to this \nbelongs \"benignity,\" for the benign are those in whom the salutary flame \n[bonus ignis] of love has enkindled the desire to be kind to their \nneighbor. Thirdly, as to his suffering with equanimity the evils his \nneighbor inflicts on him. To this belongs \"meekness,\" which curbs anger. \nFourthly, in the point of our refraining from doing harm to our neighbor \nnot only through anger, but also through fraud or deceit. To this \npertains \"faith,\" if we take it as denoting fidelity. But if we take it \nfor the faith whereby we believe in God, then man is directed thereby to \nthat which is above him, so that he subject his intellect and, \nconsequently, all that is his, to God.\nMan is well disposed in respect of that which is below him, as regards \nexternal action, by \"modesty,\" whereby we observe the \"mode\" in all our \nwords and deeds: as regards internal desires, by \"contingency\" and \n\"chastity\": whether these two differ because chastity withdraws man from \nunlawful desires, contingency also from lawful desires: or because the \ncontinent man is subject to concupiscence, but is not led away; whereas \nthe chaste man is neither subject to, nor led away from them.",

Thus contingency of the married \nstate is said to be signified by the thirtyfold fruit; the contingency of \nwidowhood, by the sixtyfold; and virginal contingency, by the hundredfold \nfruit. There are, moreover, other ways in which holy men distinguish \nthree evangelical fruits according to the three degrees of virtue: and \nthey speak of three degrees, because the perfection of anything is \nconsidered with respect to its beginning, its middle, and its end.",
        "RP3": "The fact of not being disturbed by painful things is \nsomething to delight in.

Nevertheless, all the acts of the gifts and virtues \ncan be reduced to these by a certain kind of fittingness, in so far as \nall the virtues and gifts must needs direct the mind in one of the \nabove-mentioned ways. Wherefore the acts of wisdom and of any gifts \ndirecting to good, are reduced to charity, joy and peace. The reason why \nhe mentions these rather than others, is that these imply either \nenjoyment of good things, or relief from evils, which things seem to \nbelong to the notion of fruit."

First, in general: and in this way the fruits of \nthe Holy Ghost considered in general are contrary to the works of the \nflesh. Because the Holy Ghost moves the human mind to that which is in \naccord with reason, or rather to that which surpasses reason: whereas the \nfleshly, viz. the sensitive, appetite draws man to sensible goods which \nare beneath him. Wherefore, since upward and downward are contrary \nmovements in the physical order, so in human actions the works of the \nflesh are contrary to the fruits of the Spirit.\nSecondly, both fruits and fleshly works as enumerated may be considered \nsingly, each according to its specific nature. And in this they are not \nof necessity contrary each to each: because, as stated above (Article [3], ad 4), the Apostle did not intend to enumerate all the works, whether \nspiritual or carnal. However, by a kind of adaptation, Augustine, \ncommenting on Gal. 5:22,23, contrasts the fruits with the carnal works, \neach to each. Thus \"to fornication, which is the love of satisfying lust \noutside lawful wedlock, we may contrast charity, whereby the soul is \nwedded to God: wherein also is true chastity. By uncleanness we must \nunderstand whatever disturbances arise from fornication: and to these the \njoy of tranquillity is opposed. Idolatry, by reason of which war was \nwaged against the Gospel of God, is opposed to peace. Against \nwitchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths and quarrels, \nthere is longsuffering, which helps us to bear the evils inflicted on us \nby those among whom we dwell; while kindness helps us to cure those \nevils; and goodness, to forgive them.

        "ANS": "Two things may be considered in virtue---the essence of \nvirtue, and that to which virtue is ordained. In the essence of virtue we \nmay consider something directly, and we may consider something \nconsequently. Virtue implies \"directly\" a disposition whereby the subject \nis well disposed according to the mode of its nature: wherefore the \nPhilosopher says (Phys. vii, text. 17) that \"virtue is a disposition of a \nperfect thing to that which is best; and by perfect I mean that which is \ndisposed according to its nature.\" That which virtue implies \n\"consequently\" is that it is a kind of goodness: because the goodness of \na thing consists in its being well disposed according to the mode of its \nnature. That to which virtue is directed is a good act, as was shown \nabove (Question [56], Article [3]).\nAccordingly three things are found to be contrary to virtue. One of \nthese is \"sin,\" which is opposed to virtue in respect of that to which \nvirtue is ordained: since, properly speaking, sin denotes an inordinate \nact; even as an act of virtue is an ordinate  and due act: in respect of \nthat which virtue implies consequently, viz. that it is a kind of \ngoodness, the contrary of virtue is \"malice\": while in respect of that \nwhich belongs to the essence of virtue directly, its contrary is \"vice\": \nbecause the vice of a thing seems to consist in its not being disposed in \na way befitting its nature: hence Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. iii): \n\"Whatever is lacking for a thing's natural perfection may be called a \nvice.\"",

But \"vice \nof the soul,\" as Cicero says (De Quaest. Tusc. iv), \"is a habit or \naffection of the soul discordant and inconsistent with itself through \nlife\": and this is to be found even without disease and sickness, e.g. \nwhen a man sins from weakness or passion. Consequently vice is of wider \nextent than sickness or disease; even as virtue extends to more things \nthan health; for health itself is reckoned a kind of virtue (Phys. vii, \ntext. 17).

For some \nsay that in every sin of omission there is some act, either interior or \nexterior---interior, as when a man wills \"not to go to church,\" when he \nis bound to go---exterior, as when a man, at the very hour that he is \nbound to go to church (or even before), occupies himself in such a way \nthat he is hindered from going. This seems, in a way, to amount to the \nsame as the first, for whoever wills one thing that is incompatible with \nthis other, wills, consequently, to go without this other: unless, \nperchance, it does not occur to him, that what he wishes to do, will \nhinder him from that which he is bound to do, in which case he might be \ndeemed guilty of negligence. On the other hand, others say, that a sin of \nomission does not necessarily suppose an act: for the mere fact of not \ndoing what one is bound to do is a sin.\nNow each of these opinions has some truth in it. For if in the sin of \nomission we look merely at that in which the essence of the sin consists, \nthe sin of omission will be sometimes with an interior act, as when a man \nwills \"not to go to church\": while sometimes it will be without any act \nat all, whether interior or exterior, as when a man, at the time that he \nis bound to go to church, does not think of going or not going to church.\nIf, however, in the sin of omission, we consider also the causes, or \noccasions of the omission, then the sin of omission must of necessity \ninclude some act. For there is no sin of omission, unless we omit what we \ncan do or not do: and that we turn aside so as not to do what we can do \nor not do, must needs be due to some cause or occasion, either united \nwith the omission or preceding it. Now if this cause be not in man's \npower, the omission will not be sinful, as when anyone omits going to \nchurch on account of sickness: but if the cause or occasion be subject to \nthe will, the omission is sinful; and such cause, in so far as it is \nvoluntary, must needs always include some act, at least the interior act \nof the will: which act sometimes bears directly on the omission, as when \na man wills \"not to go to church,\" because it is too much trouble; and in \nthis case this act, of its very nature, belongs to the omission, because \nthe volition of any sin whatever, pertains,  of itself, to that sin, \nsince voluntariness is essential to sin. Sometimes, however, the act of \nthe will bears directly on something else which hinders man from doing \nwhat he ought, whether this something else be united with the omission, \nas when a man wills to play at the time he ought to go to church---or, \nprecede the omission, as when a man wills to sit up late at night, the \nresult being that he does not go to church in the morning. In this case \nthe act, interior or exterior, is accidental to the omission, since the \nomission follows outside the intention, and that which is outside the \nintention is said to be accidental (Phys. ii, text. 49,50). Wherefore it \nis evident that then the sin of omission has indeed an act united with, \nor preceding the omission, but that this act is accidental to the sin of \nomission.\nNow in judging about things, we must be guided by that which is proper \nto them, and not by that which is accidental: and consequently it is \ntruer to say that a sin can be without any act; else the circumstantial \nacts and occasions would be essential to other actual sins.",

Again, a human \nact is evil through lacking conformity with its due measure: and \nconformity of measure in a thing depends on a rule, from which if that \nthing depart, it is incommensurate. Now there are two rules of the human \nwill: one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the human reason; the other \nis the first rule, viz. the eternal law, which is God's reason, so to \nspeak. Accordingly Augustine (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) includes two things \nin the definition of sin; one, pertaining to the substance of a human \nact, and which is the matter, so to speak, of sin, when he says \"word,\" \n\"deed,\" or \"desire\"; the other, pertaining to the nature of evil, and \nwhich is the form, as it were, of sin, when he says, \"contrary to the \neternal law.\"",

Therefore \nthe difference derived from the debt of punishment, may be consequent to \nthe specific diversity of sins, but cannot constitute it.\nNow the difference between venial and mortal sin is consequent to the \ndiversity of that inordinateness which constitutes the notion of sin. For \ninordinateness is twofold, one that destroys the principle of order, and \nanother which, without destroying the principle of order, implies \ninordinateness in the things which follow the principle: thus, in an \nanimal's body, the frame may be so out of order that the vital principle \nis destroyed; this is the inordinateness of death; while, on the other \nhand, saving the vital principle, there may be disorder in the bodily \nhumors; and then there is sickness. Now the principle of the entire moral \norder is the last end, which stands in the same relation to matters of \naction, as the indemonstrable principle does to matters of speculation \n(Ethic. vii, 8). Therefore when the soul is so disordered by sin as to \nturn away from its last end, viz. God, to Whom it is united by charity, \nthere is mortal sin; but when it is disordered without turning away from \nGod, there is venial sin. For even as in the body, the disorder of death \nwhich results from the destruction of the principle of life, is \nirreparable according to  nature, while the disorder of sickness can be \nrepaired by reason of the vital principle being preserved, so it is in \nmatters concerning the soul. Because, in speculative matters, it is \nimpossible to convince one who errs in the principles, whereas one who \nerrs, but retains the principles, can be brought back to the truth by \nmeans of the principles. Likewise in practical matters, he who, by \nsinning, turns away from his last end, if we consider the nature of his \nsin, falls irreparably, and therefore is said to sin mortally and to \ndeserve eternal punishment: whereas when a man sins without turning away \nfrom God, by the very nature of his sin, his disorder can be repaired, \nbecause the principle of the order is not destroyed; wherefore he is said \nto sin venially, because, to wit, he does not sin so as to deserve to be \npunished eternally.",

Hence we find certain acts differing from one \nanother in the material specific difference, which are nevertheless \nformally in the same species of sin, because they are directed to the one \nsame end: thus strangling, stoning, and stabbing come under the one \nspecies of murder, although the actions themselves differ specifically \naccording to the natural species.

Three reasons may be assigned for this. The first is \non the part of the subject: because spiritual sins belong to the spirit, \nto which it is proper to turn to God, and to turn away from Him; whereas \ncarnal sins are consummated in the carnal pleasure of the appetite, to \nwhich it chiefly belongs to turn to goods of the body; so that carnal \nsin, as such, denotes more a \"turning to\" something, and for that reason, \nimplies a closer cleaving; whereas spiritual sin denotes more a \"turning \nfrom\" something, whence the notion of guilt arises; and for this reason \nit involves greater guilt. A second reason may be taken on the part of \nthe person against whom sin is committed: because carnal sin, as such, is \nagainst the sinner's own body, which he ought to love less, in the order \nof charity, than God and his neighbor, against whom he commits spiritual \nsins, and consequently spiritual sins, as such, are of greater guilt. A \nthird reason may be taken from the motive, since the stronger the impulse \nto sin, the less grievous the sin, as we shall state further on (Article [6]). \nNow carnal sins have a stronger impulse, viz. our innate concupiscence of \nthe flesh. Therefore spiritual sins, as such, are of greater guilt.",

Among these causes we must \nmake a distinction; for some of them induce the will to sin in accord \nwith the very nature of the will: such is the end, which is the proper \nobject of the will; and by a such like cause sin is made more grievous, \nbecause a man sins more grievously if his will is induced to sin by the \nintention of a more evil end.

This happens in three ways. First, in so far \nas a circumstance draws a sin from one kind to another: thus fornication \nis the intercourse of a man with one who is not his wife: but if to this \nbe added the circumstance that the latter is the wife of another, the sin \nis drawn to another kind of sin, viz. injustice, in so far as he usurps \nanother's property; and in this respect adultery is a more grievous sin \nthan fornication. Secondly, a circumstance aggravates a sin, not by \ndrawing it into another genus, but only by multiplying the ratio of sin: \nthus if a wasteful man gives both when he ought not, and to whom he ought \nnot to give, he commits the same kind of sin in more ways than if he were \nto merely to give to whom he ought not, and for that very reason his sin \nis more grievous; even as that sickness is the graver which affects more \nparts of the body. Hence Cicero says (Paradox. iii) that \"in taking his \nfather's life a man commits many sins; for he outrages one who begot him, \nwho fed him, who educated him, to whom he owes his lands, his house, his \nposition in the republic.\" Thirdly, a circumstance aggravates a sin by \nadding to the deformity which the sin derives from another circumstance: \nthus, taking another's property constitutes the sin of theft; but if to \nthis be added the circumstance that much is taken of another's property, \nthe sin will be more grievous; although in itself, to take more or less \nhas not the character of a good or of an evil act.",

In this case the quantity of harm aggravates the sin directly, \nbecause then the harm is the direct object of the sin. Sometimes the harm \nis foreseen, but not intended; for instance, when a man takes a short cut \nthrough a field, the result being that he knowingly injures the growing \ncrops, although his intention is not to do this harm, but to commit \nfornication. In this case again the quantity of the harm done  aggravates \nthe sin; indirectly, however, in so far, to wit, as it is owing to his \nwill being strongly inclined to sin, that a man does not forbear from \ndoing, to himself or to another, a harm which he would not wish simply. \nSometimes, however, the harm is neither foreseen nor intended: and then \nif this harm is connected with the sin accidentally, it does not \naggravate the sin directly; but, on account of his neglecting to consider \nthe harm that might ensue, a man is deemed punishable for the evil \nresults of his action if it be unlawful. If, on the other hand, the harm \nfollow directly from the sinful act, although it be neither foreseen nor \nintended, it aggravates the sin directly, because whatever is directly \nconsequent to a sin, belongs, in a manner, to the very species of that \nsin: for instance, if a man is a notorious fornicator, the result is that \nmany are scandalized; and although such was not his intention, nor was it \nperhaps foreseen by him, yet it aggravates his sin directly.\nBut this does not seem to apply to penal harm, which the sinner himself \nincurs. Such like harm, if accidentally connected with the sinful act, \nand if neither foreseen nor intended, does not aggravate a sin, nor does \nit correspond with the gravity of the sin: for instance, if a man in \nrunning to slay, slips and hurts his foot. If, on the other hand, this \nharm is directly consequent to the sinful act, although perhaps it be \nneither foreseen nor intended, then greater harm does not make greater \nsin, but, on the contrary, a graver sin calls for the infliction of a \ngreater harm. Thus, an unbeliever who has heard nothing about the pains \nof hell, would suffer greater pain in hell for a sin of murder than for a \nsin of theft: but his sin is not aggravated on account of his neither \nintending nor foreseeing this, as it would be in the case of a believer, \nwho, seemingly, sins more grievously in the very fact that he despises a \ngreater punishment, that he may satisfy his desire to sin; but the \ngravity of this harm is caused by the sole gravity of sin.",

Hence it does not follow, supposing harm to be inflicted \nchiefly by sins against our neighbor, that such sins are the most \ngrievous, since a much greater inordinateness is to be found against \nwhich man commits against God, and in some which he commits against \nhimself. Moreover we might say that although no man can do God any harm \nin His substance, yet he can endeavor to do so in things concerning Him, \ne.g. by destroying faith, by outraging holy things, which are most \ngrievous sins.

Now the delectation in the \nthought itself results from the inclination of the appetite to the \nthought; and the thought itself is not in itself a mortal sin; sometimes \nindeed it is only a venial sin, as when a man thinks of such a thing for \nno purpose; and sometimes it is no sin at all, as when a man has a \npurpose in thinking of it; for instance, he may wish to preach or dispute \nabout it. Consequently such affection or delectation in respect of the \nthought of fornication is not a mortal sin in virtue of its genus, but is \nsometimes a venial sin and sometimes no sin at all: wherefore neither is \nit a mortal sin to consent to such a thought. In this sense the first \nopinion is true.\nBut that a man in thinking of fornication takes pleasure in the act \nthought of, is due to his desire being inclined to this act. Wherefore \nthe fact that a man consents to such a delectation, amounts to nothing \nless than a consent to the inclination of his appetite to fornication: \nfor no man takes pleasure except in that which is in conformity with his \nappetite. Now it is a mortal sin, if a man deliberately chooses that his \nappetite be conformed to what is in itself a mortal sin. Wherefore such a \nconsent to delectation in a mortal sin, is itself a mortal sin, as the \nsecond opinion maintains.",

Accordingly, so far as it is \nan act, it can have a direct cause, even as any other act; but, so far as \nit is inordinate, it has a cause, in the same way as a negation or \nprivation can have a cause. Now two causes may be assigned to a negation: \nin the first place, absence of the cause of affirmation; i.e. the \nnegation of the cause itself, is the cause of the negation in itself; \nsince the result of the removing the cause is the removal of the effect: \nthus the absence of the sun is the cause of darkness. In the second \nplace, the cause of an affirmation, of which a negation is a sequel, is \nthe accidental cause of the resulting negation: thus fire by causing heat \nin virtue of its principal tendency, consequently causes a privation of \ncold. The first of these suffices to cause a simple negation. But, since \nthe inordinateness of sin and of every evil is not a simple negation, but \nthe privation of that which something ought naturally to have, such an \ninordinateness must needs have an accidental efficient cause. For that \nwhich naturally is and ought to be in a thing, is never lacking except on \naccount of some impeding cause. And accordingly we are wont to say that \nevil, which consists in a certain privation, has a deficient cause, or an \naccidental efficient cause. Now every accidental cause is reducible to \nthe direct cause. Since then sin, on the part of its inordinateness, has \nan accidental efficient cause, and on the part of the act, a direct \nefficient cause, it follows that the  inordinateness of sin is a result \nof the cause of the act. Accordingly then, the will lacking the direction \nof the rule of reason and of the Divine law, and intent on some mutable \ngood, causes the act of sin directly, and the inordinateness of the act, \nindirectly, and beside the intention: for the lack of order in the act \nresults from the lack of direction in the will.",

If, \nhowever, the knowledge, which is removed by ignorance, would not have \nprevented the act, on account of the inclination of the will thereto, the \nlack of this knowledge does not make that man unwilling, but not willing, \nas stated in Ethic. iii, 1: and such like ignorance which is not the \ncause of the sinful act, as already stated, since it does not make the \nact to be involuntary, does not excuse from sin. The same applies to any \nignorance that does not cause, but follows or accompanies the sinful act.\nOn the other hand, ignorance which is the cause of the act, since it \nmakes it to be involuntary, of its very nature excuses from sin, because \nvoluntariness is essential to sin. But it may fail to excuse altogether \nfrom sin, and this for two reasons. First, on the part of the thing \nitself which is not known. For ignorance excuses from sin, in so far as \nsomething is not known to be a sin. Now it may happen that a person \nignores some circumstance of a sin, the knowledge of which circumstance \nwould prevent him from sinning, whether it belong to the substance of the \nsin, or not; and nevertheless his knowledge is sufficient for him to be \naware that the act is sinful; for instance, if a man strike someone, \nknowing that it is a man (which suffices for it to be sinful) and yet be \nignorant of the fact that it is his father, (which is a circumstance \nconstituting another species of sin); or, suppose that he is unaware that \nthis man will defend himself and strike him back, and that if he had \nknown this, he would not have struck him (which does not affect the \nsinfulness of the act). Wherefore, though this man sins through \nignorance, yet he is not altogether excused, because, not withstanding, \nhe has knowledge of the sin. Secondly, this may happen on the part of the \nignorance itself, because, to wit, this ignorance is voluntary, either \ndirectly, as when a man wishes of set purpose to be ignorant of certain \nthings that he may sin the more freely; or indirectly, as when a man, \nthrough stress of work or other occupations, neglects to acquire the \nknowledge which would restrain him from sin. For such like negligence \nrenders the ignorance itself voluntary and sinful, provided it be about \nmatters one is bound and able to know. Consequently this ignorance does \nnot altogether excuse from sin. If, however, the ignorance be such as to \nbe entirely involuntary, either through being invincible, or through \nbeing of matters one is not bound to know, then such like ignorance \nexcuses from sin  altogether.",

Now it happens sometimes that such like ignorance is \ndirectly and essentially voluntary, as when a man is purposely ignorant \nthat he may sin more freely, and ignorance of this kind seems rather to \nmake the act more voluntary and more sinful, since it is through the \nwill's intention to sin that he is willing to bear the hurt of ignorance, \nfor the sake of freedom in sinning.

In this he was somewhat right, because, since the object of \nthe will is a good or an apparent good, it is never moved to an evil, \nunless that which is not good appear good in some respect to the reason; \nso that the will would  never tend to evil, unless there were ignorance \nor error in the reason. Hence it is written (Prov. 14:22): \"They err that \nwork evil.\"\nExperience, however, shows that many act contrary to the knowledge that \nthey have, and this is confirmed by Divine authority, according to the \nwords of Lk. 12:47: \"The servant who knew that the will of his lord . . . \nand did not . . . shall be beaten with many stripes,\" and of James 4:17: \n\"To him . . . who knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is a \nsin.\" Consequently he was not altogether right, and it is necessary, with \nthe Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 3) to make a distinction. Because, since man \nis directed to right action by a twofold knowledge, viz. universal and \nparticular, a defect in either of them suffices to hinder the rectitude \nof the will and of the deed, as stated above (Question [76], Article [1]). It may \nhappen, then, that a man has some knowledge in general, e.g. that no \nfornication is lawful, and yet he does not know in particular that this \nact, which is fornication, must not be done; and this suffices for the \nwill not to follow the universal knowledge of the reason. Again, it must \nbe observed that nothing prevents a thing which is known habitually from \nnot being considered actually: so that it is possible for a man to have \ncorrect knowledge not only in general but also in particular, and yet not \nto consider his knowledge actually: and in such a case it does not seem \ndifficult for a man to act counter to what he does not actually consider. \nNow, that a man sometimes fails to consider in particular what he knows \nhabitually, may happen through mere lack of attention: for instance, a \nman who knows geometry, may not attend to the consideration of \ngeometrical conclusions, which he is ready to consider at any moment. \nSometimes man fails to consider actually what he knows habitually, on \naccount of some hindrance supervening, e.g. some external occupation, or \nsome bodily infirmity; and, in this way, a man who is in a state of \npassion, fails to consider in particular what he knows in general, in so \nfar as the passions hinder him from considering it. Now it hinders him in \nthree ways. First, by way of distraction, as explained above (Article [1]). \nSecondly, by way of opposition, because a passion often inclines to \nsomething contrary to what man knows in general. Thirdly, by way of \nbodily transmutation, the result of which is that the reason is somehow \nfettered so as not to exercise its act freely; even as sleep or \ndrunkenness, on account of some change wrought on the body, fetters the \nuse of reason. That this takes place in the passions is evident from the \nfact that sometimes, when the passions are very intense, man loses the \nuse of reason altogether: for many have gone out of their minds through \nexcess of love or anger. It is in this way that passion draws the reason \nto judge in particular, against the knowledge which it has in general.",

        "RP4": "He that has knowledge in a universal, is hindered, on \naccount of a passion, from reasoning about that universal, so as to draw \nthe conclusion: but he reasons about another universal proposition \nsuggested by the inclination of the passion, and draws his conclusion \naccordingly. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 3) that the \nsyllogism of an incontinent man has four propositions, two particular and \ntwo universal, of which one is of the reason, e.g. No fornication is \nlawful, and the other, of passion, e.g. Pleasure is to be pursued.

Yet neither of these \namounts to a sin through certain malice; for then alone does anyone sin \nthrough certain malice, when his will is moved to evil of its own accord. \nThis may happen in two ways. First, through his having a corrupt \ndisposition inclining him to evil, so that, in respect of that \ndisposition, some evil is, as it were, suitable and similar to him; and \nto this thing, by reason of its suitableness, the will tends, as to \nsomething good, because everything tends, of its own accord, to that \nwhich is suitable to it. Moreover this corrupt disposition is either a \nhabit acquired by custom, or a sickly condition on the part of the body, \nas in the case of a man who is naturally inclined to certain sins, by \nreason of some natural corruption in himself.  Secondly, the will, of its \nown accord, may tend to an evil, through the removal of some obstacle: \nfor instance, if a man be prevented from sinning, not through sin being \nin itself displeasing to him, but through hope of eternal life, or fear \nof hell, if hope give place to despair, or fear to presumption, he will \nend in sinning through certain malice, being freed from the bridle, as it \nwere.\nIt is evident, therefore, that sin committed through certain malice, \nalways presupposes some inordinateness in man, which, however, is not \nalways a habit: so that it does not follow of necessity, if a man sins \nthrough certain malice, that he sins through habit.",

        "ANS": "A sin committed through malice is more grievous than a \nsin committed through passion, for three reasons. First, because, as sin \nconsists chiefly in an act of the will, it follows that, other things \nbeing equal, a sin is all the more grievous, according as the movement of \nthe sin belongs more to the will. Now when a sin is committed through \nmalice, the movement of sin belongs more to the will, which is then moved \nto evil of its own accord, than when a sin is committed through passion, \nwhen the will is impelled to sin by something extrinsic, as it were. \nWherefore a sin is aggravated by the very fact that it is committed \nthrough certain malice, and so much the more, as the malice is greater; \nwhereas it is diminished by being committed through passion, and so much \nthe more, as the passion is stronger. Secondly, because the passion which \nincites the will to sin, soon passes away, so that man repents of his \nsin, and soon returns to his good intentions; whereas the habit, through \nwhich a man sins, is a permanent quality, so that he who sins through \nmalice, abides longer in his sin. For this reason the Philosopher (Ethic. \nvii, 8) compares the intemperate man, who sins through malice, to a sick \nman who suffers from a chronic disease, while he compares the incontinent \nman, who sins through passion, to one who suffers intermittently. \nThirdly, because he who sins through certain malice is ill-disposed in \nrespect of the end itself, which is the principle in matters of action; \nand so the defect is more dangerous than in the case of the man who sins \nthrough passion, whose purpose tends to a good end, although this purpose \nis interrupted on account of the passion, for the time being. Now the \nworst of all defects is defect of principle. Therefore it is evident that \na sin committed through malice is more grievous than one committed \nthrough passion.",

Now the intellect, of its very nature, \nis moved by that which enlightens it in the knowledge of truth, which the \ndevil has no intention of doing in man's regard; rather does he darken \nman's reason so that it may consent to sin, which darkness is due to the \nimagination and sensitive appetite. Consequently the operation of the \ndevil seems to be confined to the imagination and sensitive appetite, by \nmoving either of which he can induce man to sin. For his operation may \nresult in presenting certain forms to the imagination; and he is able to \nincite the sensitive appetite to some passion or other.\nThe reason of this is, that as stated in the FP, Question [110], Article [3], the \ncorporeal nature has a natural aptitude to be moved locally by the \nspiritual nature: so that the devil can produce all those effects which \ncan result from the local movement of bodies here below, except he be \nrestrained by the Divine power. Now the representation of forms to the \nimagination is due, sometimes, to local movement: for the Philosopher \nsays (De Somno et Vigil.) [*De Insomn. iii, iv.] that \"when an animal \nsleeps, the blood descends in abundance to the sensitive principle, and \nthe movements descend with it, viz.  the impressions left by the action \nof sensible objects, which impressions are preserved by means of sensible \nspecies, and continue to move the apprehensive principle, so that they \nappear just as though the sensitive principles were being affected by \nthem at the time.\" Hence such a local movement of the vital spirits or \nhumors can be procured by the demons, whether man sleep or wake: and so \nit happens that man's imagination is brought into play.\nIn like manner, the sensitive appetite is incited to certain passions \naccording to certain fixed movements of the heart and the vital spirits: \nwherefore the devil can cooperate in this also. And through certain \npassions being aroused in the sensitive appetite, the result is that man \nmore easily perceives the movement or sensible image which is brought in \nthe manner explained, before the apprehensive principle, since, as the \nPhilosopher observes (De Somno et Virgil.: De Insomn. iii, iv), \"lovers \nare moved, by even a slight likeness, to an apprehension of the beloved.\" \nIt also happens, through the rousing of a passion, that what is put \nbefore the imagination, is judged, as being something to be pursued, \nbecause, to him who is held by a passion, whatever the passion inclines \nhim to, seems good. In this way the devil induces man inwardly to sin.",

For this reason children are taken to be baptized soon after \ntheir birth, to show that they have to be washed from some uncleanness. \nThe contrary is part of the Pelagian heresy, as is clear from Augustine \nin many of his books [*For instance, Retract. i, 9; De Pecc. Merit. et \nRemiss. ix; Contra Julian. iii, 1; De Dono Persev. xi, xii.]\nIn endeavoring to explain how the sin of our first parent could be \ntransmitted by way of origin to his descendants, various writers have \ngone about it in various ways. For some, considering that the subject of \nsin is the rational soul, maintained that the rational soul is \ntransmitted with the semen, so that thus an infected soul would seem to \nproduce other infected souls. Others, rejecting this as erroneous, \nendeavored to show how the guilt of the parent's soul can be transmitted \nto the children, even though the soul be not transmitted, from the fact \nthat defects of the body are transmitted from parent to child---thus a \nleper may beget a leper, or a gouty man may be the father of a gouty son, \non account of some seminal corruption, although this corruption is not \nleprosy or gout. Now since the body is proportionate to the soul, and \nsince the soul's defects redound into the body, and vice versa, in like \nmanner, say they, a culpable defect of the soul is passed on to the \nchild, through the transmission of the semen, albeit the semen itself is \nnot the subject of the guilt.\nBut all these explanations are insufficient. Because, granted that some \nbodily defects are transmitted by way of origin from parent to child, and \ngranted that even some defects of the soul are transmitted in \nconsequence, on account of a defect in the bodily habit, as in the case \nof idiots begetting idiots; nevertheless the fact of having a defect by \nthe way of origin seems to exclude the notion of guilt, which is \nessentially something voluntary. Wherefore granted that the rational soul \nwere transmitted, from the very fact that the stain on the child's soul \nis not in its will, it would cease to be a guilty stain binding its \nsubject to punishment; for, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5), \"no \none reproaches a man born blind; one rather takes pity on him.\"\nTherefore we must explain the matter otherwise by saying that all men \nborn of Adam may be considered as one man, inasmuch as they have one \ncommon nature, which they receive from their first parents; even as in \ncivil matters, all who are members of one community are reputed as one \nbody, and the whole community as one man. Indeed Porphyry says (Praedic., \nDe Specie) that \"by sharing the same species, many men are one man.\" \nAccordingly the multitude of men born of Adam, are as so many members of \none body. Now the action of one member of the body, of the hand for \ninstance, is voluntary not by the will of that hand, but by the will of \nthe soul, the first mover of the members. Wherefore a murder which the \nhand commits would not be imputed as a sin to the hand, considered  by \nitself as apart from the body, but is imputed to it as something \nbelonging to man and moved by man's first moving principle. In this way, \nthen, the disorder which is in this man born of Adam, is voluntary, not \nby his will, but by the will of his first parent, who, by the movement of \ngeneration, moves all who originate from him, even as the soul's will \nmoves all the members to their actions. Hence the sin which is thus \ntransmitted by the first parent to his descendants is called \"original,\" \njust as the sin which flows from the soul into the bodily members is \ncalled \"actual.\" And just as the actual sin that is committed by a member \nof the body, is not the sin of that member, except inasmuch as that \nmember is a part of the man, for which reason it is called a \"human sin\"; \nso original sin is not the sin of this person, except inasmuch as this \nperson receives his nature from his first parent, for which reason it is \ncalled the \"sin of nature,\" according to Eph. 2:3: \"We . . . were by \nnature children of wrath.\"",

But if \nanyone were to be formed by God out of human flesh, it is evident that \nthe active power would not be derived from Adam. Consequently he would \nnot contract original sin: even as a hand would have no part in a human \nsin, if it were moved, not by the man's will, but by some external power.\nThe solution of this question is made clear by what has \nbeen said. For it has been stated (Article [1]) that original sin is transmitted \nby the first parent in so far as he is the mover in the begetting of his \nchildren: wherefore it has been said (Article [4]) that if anyone were begotten \nmaterially only, of human flesh, they would not contract original sin. \nNow it is evident that in the opinion of philosophers, the active \nprinciple of generation is from the father, while the mother provides the \nmatter.

This, however, seems unreasonable. Because, as \nstated in the FP, Question [97], Articles [1], 2, ad 4, immortality and impassibility, \nin the original state, were a result, not of the condition of matter, but \nof original justice, whereby the body was subjected to the soul, so long \nas the soul remained subject to God.

First, on account of the condition of \nthe sinner, who is disposed so as to have a strong inclination for one \nparticular end, the result being that he frequently goes forward to other \nsins. But this kind of  origin does not come under the consideration of \nart, because man's particular dispositions are infinite in number. \nSecondly, on account of a natural relationship of the ends to one \nanother: and it is in this way that most frequently one vice arises from \nanother, so that this kind of origin can come under the consideration of \nart.\nAccordingly therefore, those vices are called capital, whose ends have \ncertain fundamental reasons for moving the appetite; and it is in respect \nof these fundamental reasons that the capital vices are differentiated. \nNow a thing moves the appetite in two ways. First, directly and of its \nvery nature: thus good moves the appetite to seek it, while evil, for the \nsame reason, moves the appetite to avoid it. Secondly, indirectly and on \naccount of something else, as it were: thus one seeks an evil on account \nof some attendant good, or avoids a good on account of some attendant \nevil.\nAgain, man's good is threefold. For, in the first place, there is a \ncertain good of the soul, which derives its aspect of appetibility, \nmerely through being apprehended, viz. the excellence of honor and \npraise, and this good is sought inordinately by \"vainglory.\" Secondly, \nthere is the good of the body, and this regards either the preservation \nof the individual, e.g. meat and drink, which good is pursued \ninordinately by \"gluttony,\" or the preservation of the species, e.g. \nsexual intercourse, which good is sought inordinately by \"lust.\" Thirdly, \nthere is external good, viz. riches, to which \"covetousness\" is referred. \nThese same four vices avoid inordinately the contrary evils.\nOr again, good moves the appetite chiefly through possessing some \nproperty of happiness, which all men seek naturally. Now in the first \nplace happiness implies perfection, since happiness is a perfect good, to \nwhich belongs excellence or renown, which is desired by \"pride\" or \n\"vainglory.\" Secondly, it implies satiety, which \"covetousness\" seeks in \nriches that give promise thereof. Thirdly, it implies pleasure, without \nwhich happiness is impossible, as stated in Ethic. i, 7; x, 6,7,[8] and \nthis \"gluttony\" and \"lust\" pursue.\nOn the other hand, avoidance of good on account of an attendant evil \noccurs in two ways. For this happens either in respect of one's own good, \nand thus we have \"sloth,\" which is sadness about one's spiritual good, on \naccount of the attendant bodily labor: or else it happens in respect of \nanother's good, and this, if it be without recrimination, belongs to \n\"envy,\" which is sadness about another's good as being a hindrance to \none's own excellence, while if it be with recrimination with a view to \nvengeance, it is \"anger.\" Again, these same vices seek the contrary evils.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [1]), the good of nature, that is \ndiminished by sin, is the natural inclination to virtue, which is \nbefitting to man from the very fact that he is a rational being; for it \nis due to this that he performs actions in accord with reason, which is \nto act virtuously. Now sin cannot entirely take away from man the fact \nthat he is a rational being, for then he would no longer be capable of \nsin. Wherefore it is not possible for this good of nature to be destroyed \nentirely.\nSince, however, this same good of nature may be continually diminished \nby sin, some, in order to illustrate this, have made use of the example \nof a finite thing being diminished indefinitely, without being entirely \ndestroyed. For the Philosopher says (Phys. i, text. 37) that if from a \nfinite magnitude a continual subtraction be made in the same quantity, it \nwill at last be entirely destroyed, for instance if from any finite \nlength I continue to subtract the length of a span. If, however, the \nsubtraction be made each time in the same proportion, and not in the same \nquantity, it may go on indefinitely, as, for instance, if a quantity be \nhalved, and one half be diminished by half, it will be possible to go on \nthus indefinitely, provided that what is subtracted in each case be less \nthan what was subtracted before. But this does not apply to the question \nat issue, since a subsequent sin does not diminish the good of nature \nless than a previous sin, but perhaps more, if it be a more grievous sin.\nWe must, therefore, explain the matter otherwise by saying that the \naforesaid inclination is to be considered as a middle term between two \nothers: for it is based on the rational nature as on its root, and tends \nto the good of virtue, as to its term and end.  Consequently its \ndiminution may be understood in two ways: first, on the part of its rood, \nsecondly, on the part of its term. In the first way, it is not diminished \nby sin, because sin does not diminish nature, as stated above (Article [1]). But \nit is diminished in the second way, in so far as an obstacle is placed \nagainst its attaining its term. Now if it were diminished in the first \nway, it would needs be entirely destroyed at last by the rational nature \nbeing entirely destroyed. Since, however, it is diminished on the part of \nthe obstacle which is place against its attaining its term, it is evident \nthat it can be diminished indefinitely, because obstacles can be placed \nindefinitely, inasmuch as man can go on indefinitely adding sin to sin: \nand yet it cannot be destroyed entirely, because the root of this \ninclination always remains. An example of this may be seen in a \ntransparent body, which has an inclination to receive light, from the \nvery fact that it is transparent; yet this inclination or aptitude is \ndiminished on the part of supervening clouds, although it always remains \nrooted in the nature of the body.",
        "RP1": "This objection avails when diminution is made by \nsubtraction. But here the diminution is made by raising obstacles, and \nthis neither diminishes nor destroys the root of the inclination, as \nstated above.",

        "RP3": "Even in the lost the natural inclination to virtue remains, \nelse they would have no remorse of conscience. That it is not reduced to \nact is owing to their being deprived of grace by Divine justice. Thus \neven in a blind man the aptitude to see remains in the very root of his \nnature, inasmuch as he is an animal naturally endowed with sight: yet \nthis aptitude is not reduced to act, for the lack of a cause capable of \nreducing it, by forming the organ requisite for sight."

And in respect of this nature, every corruption and \ndefect is contrary to nature, as stated in De Coelo ii, text. 37, since \nthis power tends to the being and preservation of the thing to which it \nbelongs.\nOn the other hand, the universal nature is an active force in some \nuniversal principle of nature, for instance in some heavenly body; or \nagain belonging to some superior substance, in which sense God is said by \nsome to be \"the Nature Who makes nature.\" This force intends the good and \nthe preservation of the universe, for which alternate generation and \ncorruption in things are requisite: and in this respect corruption and \ndefect in things are natural, not indeed as regards the inclination of \nthe form which is the principle of being and perfection, but as regards \nthe inclination of matter which is allotted proportionately to its \nparticular form  according to the discretion of the universal agent.

In \nthis respect man is naturally corruptible as regards the nature of his \nmatter left to itself, but not as regards the nature of his form.\nThe first three objections argue on the side of the matter; while the \nother three argue on the side of the form.

For we may note a twofold condition in \nany matter, one which the agent chooses, and another which is not chosen \nby the agent, and is a natural condition of matter. Thus, a smith in \norder to make a knife, chooses a matter both hard and flexible, which can \nbe sharpened so as to be useful for cutting, and in respect of this \ncondition iron is a matter adapted for a knife: but that iron be \nbreakable and inclined to rust, results from the natural disposition of \niron, nor does the workman choose this in the iron, indeed he would do \nwithout it if he could: wherefore this disposition of matter is not \nadapted to the workman's intention, nor to the purpose of his art. In \nlike manner the human body is the matter chosen by nature in respect of \nits being of a mixed temperament, in order that it may be most suitable \nas an organ of touch and of the other sensitive and motive powers. \nWhereas the fact that it is corruptible is due to a condition of matter, \nand is not chosen by nature: indeed nature would choose an incorruptible \nmatter if it could. But God, to Whom every nature is subject, in forming \nman supplied the defect of nature, and by the gift of original justice, \ngave the body a certain incorruptibility, as was stated in the FP, Question [97], \nArticle [1].

But if we speak of a punishment that is \nmedicinal, in this way it does happen that one is punished for another's \nsin. For it has been stated (Article [7]) that ills sustained in bodily goods or \neven in the body itself, are medicinal punishments intended for the \nhealth of the soul. Wherefore there is no reason why one should not have \nsuch like punishments inflicted on one for another's sin, either by God \nor by man; e.g. on children for their parents, or on servants for their \nmasters, inasmuch as they are their property so to speak; in such a way, \nhowever, that, if the children or the servants take part in the sin, this \npenal ill has the character of punishment in regard to both the one \npunished and the one he is punished for. But if they do not take part in \nthe sin, it has the character of punishment in regard to the one for whom \nthe punishment is borne, while, in regard to the one who is punished, it \nis merely medicinal (except accidentally, if he consent to the other's \nsin), since it is intended for the good of his soul, if he bears it \npatiently.\nWith regard to spiritual punishments, these are not merely medicinal, \nbecause the good of the soul is not directed to a yet higher good. \nConsequently no one suffers loss in the goods of the soul without some \nfault of his own. Wherefore Augustine says (Ep. ad Avit.) [*Ep. ad \nAuxilium, ccl.], such like punishments are not inflicted on one for \nanother's sin, because, as regards the soul, the son is not the father's \nproperty.

Moreover they \ndeserve heavier punishment if, seeing the punishment of their parents, \nthey fail to mend their ways. The text adds, \"to the third and fourth \ngeneration,\" because men are wont to live long  enough to see the third \nand fourth generation, so that both the children can witness their \nparents' sins so as to imitate them, and the parents can see their \nchildren's punishments so as to grieve for them.",

Consequently the perfect notion of sin, which Augustine \ngives, applies to mortal sin. On the other hand, venial sin is called a \nsin, in reference to an imperfect notion of sin, and in relation to \nmortal sin: even as an accident is called a being, in relation to \nsubstance, in reference to the imperfect notion of being.

It is of this venial sin that we wish to \nspeak now.\nFor as regards the first two, it is evident that they have no \ndeterminate genus: whereas venial sin, taken in the third sense, can have \na determinate genus, so that one sin may be venial generically, and \nanother generically mortal, according as the genus or species of an act \nis determined by its object.

Now, just as in the body there is a twofold comeliness, one \nresulting from the inward disposition of the members and colors, the \nother resulting from outward refulgence supervening, so too, in the soul, \nthere is a twofold comeliness, one habitual and, so to speak, intrinsic, \nthe other actual like an outward flash of light. Now venial sin is a \nhindrance to actual comeliness, but not to habitual comeliness, because \nit neither destroys nor diminishes the habit of charity and of the other \nvirtues, as we shall show further on (SS, Question [24], Article [10]; Question [133], Article [1], ad 2), but only hinders their acts. On the other hand a stain denotes \nsomething permanent in the thing stained, wherefore it seems in the \nnature of a loss of habitual rather than of actual comeliness. Therefore, \nproperly speaking, venial sin does not cause a stain in the soul. If, \nhowever, we find it stated anywhere that it does induce a stain, this is \nin a restricted sense, in so far as it hinders the comeliness that \nresults from acts of virtue.\nIn mortal sin the soul comes into contact with a temporal \nthing as its end, so that the shedding of the light of grace, which \naccrues to those who, by charity, cleave to God as their last end, is \nentirely cut off.  in venial sin, man does not cleave to \na creature as his last end: hence there is no comparison.",

This, however, is not to be \nunderstood as though on account of the perfection of his state, the sin \nwhich is venial for us would have been mortal for him, if he had \ncommitted it. Because the dignity of a person is circumstance that \naggravates a sin, but it does not transfer it to another species, unless \nthere be an additional deformity by reason of disobedience, or vow or the \nlike, which does not apply to the question in point. Consequently what is \nvenial in itself could not be changed into mortal by reason of the \nexcellence of the original state. We must therefore understand this to \nmean that he could not sin venially, because it was impossible for him to \ncommit a sin which was venial in itself, before losing the integrity of \nthe original state by sinning mortally.\nThe reason for this is because venial sin occurs in us, either through \nthe imperfection of the act, as in the case of sudden movements, in a \ngenus of mortal sin or through some inordinateness in respect of things \nreferred to the end, the due order of the end being safeguarded. Now each \nof these happens on account of some defect of order, by reason of the \nlower powers not being checked by the higher. Because the sudden rising \nof a movement of the sensuality in us is due to the sensuality not being \nperfectly subject to reason: and the sudden rising of a movement of \nreason itself is due, in us, to the fact that the execution of the act of \nreason is not subject to the act of deliberation which proceeds from a \nhigher good, as stated above (Question [74], Article [10]); and that the human mind be \nout of order as regards things directed to the end, the due order of the \nend being safeguarded, is due to the fact that the things referred to the \nend are not infallibly directed under the end, which holds the highest \nplace, being the beginning, as it were, in matters concerning the \nappetite, as stated above (Question [10], Articles [1],2, ad 3; Question [72], Article [5]). Now, in \nthe state of innocence, as stated in the FP, Question [95], Article [1], there was an \nunerring stability of order, so that the lower powers were always \nsubjected to the higher, so long as man remained subject to God, as \nAugustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 13). Hence there can be no \ninordinateness in man, unless first of  all the highest part of man were \nnot subject to God, which constitutes a mortal sin.

Secondly, as perfect and imperfect in the same species, e.g. a boy \nand a man: and in this way the Divine law is divided into Old and New. \nHence the Apostle (Gal. 3:24,25) compares the state of man under the Old \nLaw to that of a child \"under a pedagogue\"; but the state under the New \nLaw, to that of a full grown man, who is \"no longer under a pedagogue.\"\nNow the perfection and imperfection of these two laws is to be taken in \nconnection with the three conditions pertaining to law, as stated above. \nFor, in the first place, it belongs to law to be directed to the common \ngood as to its end, as stated above (Question [90], Article [2]). This good may be \ntwofold. It may be a sensible and earthly good; and to this, man was \ndirectly ordained by the Old Law: wherefore, at the very outset of the \nlaw, the people were invited to the earthly kingdom of the Chananaeans \n(Ex. 3:8,17). Again it may be an intelligible and heavenly good: and to \nthis, man is ordained by the New Law. Wherefore, at the very beginning of \nHis preaching, Christ invited men to the kingdom of heaven, saying (Mt. 4:17): \"Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Hence \nAugustine says (Contra Faust. iv) that \"promises of temporal goods are \ncontained in the Old Testament, for which reason it is called old; but \nthe promise of eternal life belongs to the New Testament.\"\nSecondly, it belongs to the law to direct human acts according to the \norder of righteousness (Article [4]): wherein also the New Law surpasses the Old \nLaw, since it directs our internal acts, according to Mt. 5:20: \"Unless \nyour justice abound more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you \nshall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" Hence the saying that \"the \nOld Law restrains the hand, but the New Law controls the mind\" ( Sentent. \niii, D, xl).\nThirdly, it belongs to the law to induce men to observe its  \ncommandments. This the Old Law did by the fear of punishment: but the New \nLaw, by love, which is poured into our hearts by the grace of Christ, \nbestowed in the New Law, but foreshadowed in the Old. Hence Augustine \nsays (Contra Adimant. Manich. discip. xvii) that \"there is little \ndifference [*The 'little difference' refers to the Latin words 'timor' \nand 'amor'---'fear' and 'love.'] between the Law and the Gospel---fear \nand love.\"",

        "RP2": "The salvation of man could not be achieved otherwise than \nthrough Christ, according to Acts 4:12: \"There is no other name . . . \ngiven to men, whereby we must be saved.\" Consequently the law that brings \nall to salvation could not be given until after the coming of Christ. But \nbefore His coming it was necessary to give to the people, of whom Christ \nwas to be born, a law containing certain rudiments of righteousness unto \nsalvation, in order to prepare them to receive Him.",

Hence the necessity for the Divine law to be twofold, \nas already explained."

Now those who are subject to a law may receive a twofold \ninclination from the lawgiver. First, in so far as he directly inclines \nhis subjects to something; sometimes indeed different subjects to \ndifferent acts; in this way we may say that there is a military law and a \nmercantile law. Secondly, indirectly; thus by the very fact that a \nlawgiver deprives a subject of some dignity, the latter passes into \nanother order, so as to be under another law, as it were: thus if a \nsoldier be turned out of the army, he becomes a subject of rural or of \nmercantile legislation.\nAccordingly under the Divine Lawgiver various creatures have various \nnatural inclinations, so that what is, as it were, a law for one, is \nagainst the law for another: thus I might say that fierceness is, in a \nway, the law of a dog, but against the law of a sheep or another meek \nanimal. And so the law of man, which, by the Divine ordinance, is \nallotted to him, according to his proper natural condition, is that he \nshould act in accordance with reason: and this law was so effective in \nthe primitive state, that nothing either beside or against reason could \ntake man unawares. But when man turned his back on God, he fell under the \ninfluence of his sensual impulses: in fact this happens to each one \nindividually, the more he deviates from the path of reason, so that, \nafter a fashion, he is likened to the beasts that are led by the impulse \nof sensuality, according to Ps. 48:21: \"Man, when he was in honor, did \nnot understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like \nto them.\"\nSo, then, this very inclination of sensuality which is called the \n\"fomes,\" in other animals has simply the nature of a law (yet only in so \nfar as a law may be said to be in such things), by reason of a direct \ninclination. But in man, it has not the nature of law in this way, rather \nis it a deviation from the law of reason. But since, by the just sentence \nof God, man is destitute of original justice, and his reason bereft of \nits vigor, this impulse of sensuality, whereby he is led, in so far as it \nis a penalty following from the Divine law depriving man of his proper \ndignity, has the nature of a law.",

For those things are subject to human government, which can be \ndone by man; but what pertains to the nature of man is not subject to \nhuman government; for instance, that he should have a soul, hands, or \nfeet.

But since the rational nature, \ntogether with that which it has in common with all creatures, has \nsomething proper to itself inasmuch as it is rational, consequently it is \nsubject to the eternal law in both ways; because while each rational \ncreature has some knowledge of the eternal law, as stated above (Article [2]), \nit also has a natural  inclination to that which is in harmony with the \neternal law; for \"we are naturally adapted to the recipients of virtue\" \n(Ethic. ii, 1).\nBoth ways, however, are imperfect, and to a certain extent destroyed, in \nthe wicked; because in them the natural inclination to virtue is \ncorrupted by vicious habits, and, moreover, the natural knowledge of good \nis darkened by passions and habits of sin. But in the good both ways are \nfound more perfect: because in them, besides the natural knowledge of \ngood, there is the added knowledge of faith and wisdom; and again, \nbesides the natural inclination to good, there is the added motive of \ngrace and virtue.\nAccordingly, the good are perfectly subject to the eternal law, as \nalways acting according to it: whereas the wicked are subject to the \neternal law, imperfectly as to their actions, indeed, since both their \nknowledge of good, and their inclination thereto, are imperfect; but this \nimperfection on the part of action is supplied on the part of passion, in \nso far as they suffer what the eternal law decrees concerning them, \naccording as they fail to act in harmony with that law. Hence Augustine \nsays (De Lib. Arb. i, 15): \"I esteem that the righteous act according to \nthe eternal law; and (De Catech.

Secondly, it can be understood as meaning that the \nworks of a man, who is led by the Holy Ghost, are the works of the Holy \nGhost rather than his own. Therefore, since the Holy Ghost is not under \nthe law, as neither is the Son, as stated above (Article [4], ad 2); it follows \nthat such works, in so far as they are of the Holy Ghost, are not under \nthe law.

Nevertheless in no man does the prudence of the flesh dominate \nso far as to destroy the whole good of his nature: and consequently there \nremains in man the inclination to act in accordance with the eternal law. \nFor we have seen above (Question [85], Article [2]) that sin does not destroy entirely \nthe good of nature.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [91], Article [3]), the precepts of the \nnatural law are to the practical reason, what the first principles of \ndemonstrations are to the speculative reason; because both are \nself-evident principles. Now a thing is said to be self-evident in two \nways: first, in itself; secondly, in relation to us. Any proposition is \nsaid to be self-evident in itself, if its predicate is contained in the \nnotion of the subject: although, to one who knows not the definition of \nthe subject, it happens that such a proposition is not self-evident. For \ninstance, this proposition, \"Man is a rational being,\" is, in its very \nnature, self-evident, since who says \"man,\" says \"a rational being\": and \nyet to one who knows not what a man is, this proposition is not \nself-evident. Hence it is that, as Boethius says (De Hebdom.), certain \naxioms or propositions are universally self-evident to all; and such are \nthose propositions whose terms are known to all, as, \"Every whole is \ngreater than its part,\" and, \"Things equal to one and the same are equal \nto one another.\" But some propositions are self-evident only to the wise, \nwho understand the meaning of the terms of such propositions: thus to one \nwho understands that an angel is not a body, it is self-evident that an \nangel is not circumscriptively in a place: but this is not evident to the \nunlearned, for they cannot grasp it.\nNow a certain order is to be found in those things that are apprehended \nuniversally. For that which, before aught else, falls under apprehension, \nis \"being,\" the notion of which is included in all things whatsoever a \nman apprehends. Wherefore the first indemonstrable principle is that \"the \nsame thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time,\" which is \nbased on the notion of \"being\" and \"not-being\": and on this principle all \nothers are based, as is stated in Metaph. iv, text. 9. Now as \"being\" is \nthe first thing that falls under the apprehension simply, so \"good\" is \nthe first thing that falls under the apprehension of the practical \nreason, which is directed to action: since every agent acts for an end \nunder the aspect of good. Consequently the first principle of practical \nreason is one founded on the notion of good, viz. that \"good is that \nwhich all things seek after.\" Hence this is the first precept of law, \nthat \"good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided.\" All \nother precepts of the natural law are based upon this: so that whatever \nthe practical reason naturally apprehends as man's good (or evil) belongs \nto the precepts of the natural law as something to be done or avoided.\nSince, however, good has the nature of an end, and evil, the nature of a \ncontrary, hence it is that all those things to which man has a natural \ninclination, are naturally apprehended by reason as being good, and \nconsequently as objects of pursuit, and their  contraries as evil, and \nobjects of avoidance. Wherefore according to the order of natural \ninclinations, is the order of the precepts of the natural law. Because in \nman there is first of all an inclination to good in accordance with the \nnature which he has in common with all substances: inasmuch as every \nsubstance seeks the preservation of its own being, according to its \nnature: and by reason of this inclination, whatever is a means of \npreserving human life, and of warding off its obstacles, belongs to the \nnatural law. Secondly, there is in man an inclination to things that \npertain to him more specially, according to that nature which he has in \ncommon with other animals: and in virtue of this inclination, those \nthings are said to belong to the natural law, \"which nature has taught to \nall animals\" [*Pandect. Just. I, tit. i], such as sexual intercourse, \neducation of offspring and so forth. Thirdly, there is in man an \ninclination to good, according to the nature of his reason, which nature \nis proper to him: thus man has a natural inclination to know the truth \nabout God, and to live in society: and in this respect, whatever pertains \nto this inclination belongs to the natural law; for instance, to shun \nignorance, to avoid offending those among whom one has to live, and other \nsuch things regarding the above inclination.",

Now the process \nof reason is from the common to the proper, as stated in Phys. i. The \nspeculative reason, however, is differently situated in this matter, from \nthe practical reason. For, since the speculative reason is busied chiefly \nwith the necessary things, which cannot be otherwise than they are, its \nproper conclusions, like the universal principles, contain the truth \nwithout fail. The practical reason, on the other hand, is busied with \ncontingent matters, about which human actions are concerned: and \nconsequently, although there is necessity in the general principles, the \nmore we descend to matters of detail, the more frequently we encounter \ndefects. Accordingly then in speculative matters truth is the same in all \nmen, both as to principles and as to conclusions: although the truth is \nnot known to all as regards the conclusions, but only as regards the \nprinciples which are called common notions. But in matters of action, \ntruth or practical rectitude is not the same for all, as to matters of \ndetail, but only as to the general principles: and where there is the \nsame rectitude in matters of detail, it is not equally known to all.\nIt is therefore evident that, as regards the general principles whether \nof speculative or of practical reason, truth or rectitude is the same for \nall, and is equally known by all. As to the proper conclusions of the \nspeculative reason, the truth is the same for all, but is not equally \nknown to all: thus it is true for all that the three angles of a triangle \nare together equal to two right angles, although it is not known to all. \nBut as to the proper conclusions of the practical reason, neither is the \ntruth or rectitude the same for all, nor, where it is the same, is it \nequally known by all. Thus it is right and true for all to act according \nto reason: and from this principle it follows as a proper  conclusion, \nthat goods entrusted to another should be restored to their owner.

And this principle will be found to fail \nthe more, according as we descend further into detail, e.g. if one were \nto say that goods held in trust should be restored with such and such a \nguarantee, or in such and such a way; because the greater the number of \nconditions added, the greater the number of ways in which the principle \nmay fail, so that it be not right to restore or not to restore.\nConsequently we must say that the natural law, as to general principles, \nis the same for all, both as to rectitude and as to knowledge. But as to \ncertain matters of detail, which are conclusions, as it were, of those \ngeneral principles, it is the same for all in the majority of cases, both \nas to rectitude and as to knowledge; and yet in some few cases it may \nfail, both as to rectitude, by reason of certain obstacles (just as \nnatures subject to generation and corruption fail in some few cases on \naccount of some obstacle), and as to knowledge, since in some the reason \nis perverted by passion, or evil habit, or an evil disposition of nature; \nthus formerly, theft, although it is expressly contrary to the natural \nlaw, was not considered wrong among the Germans, as Julius Caesar relates \n(De Bello Gall. vi).",

Certain beginnings of these he has from nature, viz. his reason \nand his hands; but he has not the full complement, as other animals have, \nto whom nature has given sufficiency of clothing and food. Now it is \ndifficult to see how man could suffice for himself in the matter of this \ntraining: since the perfection of virtue consists chiefly in withdrawing \nman from undue pleasures, to which above all man is inclined, and \nespecially the young, who are more capable of being trained. Consequently \na man needs to receive this training from another, whereby to arrive at \nthe perfection of virtue. And as to those young people who are inclined \nto acts of virtue, by their good natural disposition, or by custom, or \nrather by the gift of God, paternal training suffices, which is by \nadmonitions. But since some are found to be depraved, and prone to vice, \nand not easily amenable to words, it was necessary for such to be \nrestrained from evil by force and fear, in order that, at least, they \nmight desist from evil-doing, and leave others in peace, and that they \nthemselves, by being habituated in this way, might be brought to do \nwillingly what hitherto they did from fear, and thus become virtuous.

And this higher measure is twofold, viz. \nthe Divine law and the natural law, as explained above (Article [2]; Question [93], Article [3]).

Now, in the notion of human law, \nmany things are contained, in respect of any of which human law can be \ndivided properly and of itself. For in the first place it belongs to the \nnotion of human law, to be derived from the law of nature, as explained \nabove (Article [2]).

In this respect human law may be divided \naccording to the different kinds of men who work in a special way for the \ncommon good: e.g. priests, by praying to God for the people; princes, by \ngoverning the people; soldiers, by fighting for the safety of the people. \nWherefore certain special kinds of law are adapted to these men.\nThirdly, it belongs to the notion of human law, to be framed by that one \nwho governs the community of the state, as shown above (Question [90], Article [3]). In \nthis respect, there are various human laws according to the various forms \nof government. Of these, according to the Philosopher (Polit. iii, 10) \none is \"monarchy,\" i.e. when the state is governed by one; and then we \nhave \"Royal Ordinances.\" Another form is \"aristocracy,\" i.e. government \nby the best men or men of highest rank; and then we have the \n\"Authoritative legal opinions\" [Responsa Prudentum] and \"Decrees of the \nSenate\" [Senatus consulta].

Another form of government is that of the people, \nwhich is called \"democracy,\" and there we have \"Decrees of the \ncommonalty\" [Plebiscita]. There is also tyrannical government, which is \naltogether corrupt, which, therefore, has no corresponding law. Finally, \nthere is a form of government made up of all these, and which is the \nbest: and in this respect we have law sanctioned by the \"Lords and \nCommons,\" as stated by Isidore (Etym. v, 4, seqq.).\nFourthly, it belongs to the notion of human law to direct human actions. \nIn this respect, according to the various matters of which the law \ntreats, there are various kinds of laws, which are sometimes named after \ntheir authors: thus we have the \"Lex Julia\" about adultery, the \"Lex \nCornelia\" concerning assassins, and so on, differentiated in this way, \nnot on account of the authors, but on account of the matters to which \nthey refer.",

Wherefore on Ps. 50:6: \"To Thee only have I sinned,\" a gloss says \nthat \"there is no man who can judge the deeds of a king.\" But as to the \ndirective force of law, the sovereign is subject to the law by his own \nwill, according to the statement (Extra, De Constit. cap.

For just as a \ndoctrine is shown to be good by the fact that it accords with right \nreason, so is a law proved to be good if it accords with reason. Now the \nOld Law was in accordance with reason. Because it repressed concupiscence \nwhich is in conflict with reason, as evidenced by the commandment, \"Thou \nshalt not covet thy neighbor's goods\" (Ex. 20:17). Moreover the same law \nforbade all kinds of sin; and these too are contrary to reason. \nConsequently it is evident that it was a good law. The Apostle argues in \nthe same way (Rm. 7): \"I am delighted,\" says he (verse 22), \"with the law \nof God, according to the inward man\": and again (verse 16): \"I consent to \nthe law, that is good.\"\nBut it must be noted that the good has various degrees, as Dionysius \nstates (Div. Nom. iv): for there is a perfect good, and an imperfect \ngood. In things ordained to an end, there is perfect goodness when a \nthing is such that it is sufficient in itself to conduce to the end: \nwhile there is imperfect goodness when a thing is of some assistance in \nattaining the end, but is not sufficient for the realization thereof. \nThus a medicine is perfectly good, if it gives health to a man; but it is \nimperfect, if it helps to cure him, without being able to bring him back \nto health. Again it must be observed that the end of human law is \ndifferent from the end of Divine law. For the end of human law is the \ntemporal tranquillity of the state, which end law effects by directing \nexternal actions, as regards those evils which might disturb the peaceful \ncondition of the state. On the other hand, the end of the Divine law is \nto bring man to that end which is everlasting happiness; which end is \nhindered by any sin, not only of external, but also of internal action. \nConsequently that which suffices for the perfection of human law, viz. \nthe prohibition and punishment of sin, does not suffice for the \nperfection of the Divine law: but it is requisite that it should make man \naltogether fit to partake of everlasting happiness. Now this cannot be \ndone save by the grace of the Holy Ghost, whereby \"charity\" which \nfulfilleth the law . . . \"is spread abroad in our hearts\" (Rm. 5:5): \nsince \"the grace of God is life everlasting\" (Rm. 6:23). But the Old Law \ncould not confer this grace, for this was reserved to Christ; because, as \nit is written  (Jn. 1:17), the law was given \"by Moses, grace and truth \ncame by Jesus Christ.\" Consequently the Old Law was good indeed, but \nimperfect, according to Heb. 7:19: \"The law brought nothing to \nperfection.\"",

Hence it is written (Is. 41:2): \"Who hath raised up the just one form the east, hath called him to \nfollow him?\"\nIt is therefore evident that it was merely from gratuitous  election \nthat the patriarchs received the promise, and that the people sprung from \nthem received the law; according to Dt. 4:36, 37: \"Ye did [Vulg.: 'Thou \ndidst'] hear His words out of the midst of the fire, because He loved thy \nfathers, and chose their seed after them.\" And if again it asked why He \nchose this people, and not another, that Christ might be born thereof; a \nfitting answer is given by Augustine (Tract. super Joan. xxvi): \"Why He \ndraweth one and draweth not another, seek not thou to judge, if thou wish \nnot to err.\"",

Now \nthe precepts refer to things which have to be done: and to their \nfulfilment man is induced by two considerations, viz. the authority of \nthe lawgiver, and the benefit derived from the fulfilment, which benefit \nconsists in the attainment of some good, useful, pleasurable or virtuous, \nor in the avoidance of some contrary evil. Hence it was necessary that in \nthe Old Law certain things should be set forth to indicate the authority \nof God the lawgiver: e.g. Dt. 6:4: \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is \none Lord\"; and Gn. 1:1: \"In the beginning God created heaven and earth\": \nand these are called \"testimonies.\" Again it was necessary that in the \nLaw certain rewards should be appointed for those who observe the Law, \nand punishments for those who transgress; as it may be seen in Dt. 28: \n\"If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God . . . He will make thee \nhigher than all the nations,\" etc.: and these are called \n\"justifications,\" according as God punishes or rewards certain ones \njustly.\nThe things that have to be done do not come under the precept except in \nso far as they have the character of a duty. Now a duty is twofold: one \naccording to the rule of reason; the other according to the rule of a law \nwhich prescribes that duty: thus the Philosopher distinguishes a twofold \njust---moral and legal (Ethic. v, 7).\nMoral duty is twofold: because reason dictates that something must be \ndone, either as being so necessary that without it the order of virtue \nwould be destroyed; or as being useful for the better maintaining of the \norder of virtue. And in this sense some of the moral precepts are \nexpressed by way of absolute command or prohibition, as \"Thou shalt not \nkill, Thou shalt not steal\": and these are properly called \"precepts.\" \nOther things are prescribed or forbidden, not as an absolute duty, but as \nsomething better to be done. These may be called \"commandments\"; because \nthey are expressed by way of inducement and persuasion: an example \nwhereof is seen in Ex. 22:26: \"If thou take of thy neighbor a garment in \npledge, thou shalt give it him again before sunset\"; and in other like \ncases. Wherefore Jerome (Praefat. in Comment. super Marc.) says that \n\"justice is in the precepts, charity in the commandments.\" Duty as fixed \nby the Law, belongs to the judicial precepts, as regards human affairs; \nto the \"ceremonial\" precepts, as regards Divine matters.\nNevertheless those ordinances also which refer to punishments and \nrewards may be called \"testimonies,\" in so far as they testify to the \nDivine justice. Again all the precepts of the Law may be  styled \n\"justifications,\" as being executions of legal justice. Furthermore the \ncommandments may be distinguished from the precepts, so that those things \nbe called \"precepts\" which God Himself prescribed; and those things \n\"commandments\" which He enjoined [mandavit] through others, as the very \nword seems to denote.\nFrom this it is clear that all the precepts of the Law are either moral, \nceremonial, or judicial; and that other ordinances have not the character \nof a precept, but are directed to the observance of the precepts, as \nstated above.",

Consequently with regard to sins of murder and \nfalse witness, it was necessary to proscribe, not sins of thought, but \nonly sins of deed.\nReply to Objection 6: As stated above (Question [25], Article [1]), all the passions of the \nirascible faculty arise from the passions of the concupiscible part. \nHence, as the precepts of the decalogue are, as it were, the first \nelements of the Law, there was no need for mention of the irascible \npassions, but only of the concupiscible passions.",

        "ANS": "As stated above (Article [2]), just as the precepts of human law \ndirect man in his relations to the human community, so the precepts of \nthe Divine law direct man in his relations to a community or commonwealth \nof men under God. Now in order that any man may dwell aright in a \ncommunity, two things are required: the first is that he behave well to \nthe head of the community; the other is that he behave well to those who \nare his fellows and partners in the community. It is therefore necessary \nthat the Divine law should contain in the first place precepts ordering \nman  in his relations to God; and in the second place, other precepts \nordering man in his relations to other men who are his neighbors and live \nwith him under God.\nNow man owes three things to the head of the community: first, fidelity; \nsecondly, reverence; thirdly, service. Fidelity to his master consists in \nhis not giving sovereign honor to another: and this is the sense of the \nfirst commandment, in the words \"Thou shalt not have strange gods.\" \nReverence to his master requires that he should do nothing injurious to \nhim: and this is conveyed by the second commandment, \"Thou shalt not take \nthe name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" Service is due to the master in \nreturn for the benefits which his subjects receive from him: and to this \nbelongs the third commandment of the sanctification of the Sabbath in \nmemory of the creation of all things.\nTo his neighbors a man behaves himself well both in particular and in \ngeneral. In particular, as to those to whom he is indebted, by paying his \ndebts: and in this sense is to be taken the commandment about honoring \none's parents. In general, as to all men, by doing harm to none, either \nby deed, or by word, or by thought. By deed, harm is done to one's \nneighbor---sometimes in his person, i.e. as to his personal existence; \nand this is forbidden by the words, \"Thou shalt not kill\": sometimes in a \nperson united to him, as to the propagation of offspring; and this is \nprohibited by the words, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\": sometimes in \nhis possessions, which are directed to both the aforesaid; and with this \nregard to this it is said, \"Thou shalt not steal.\" Harm done by word is \nforbidden when it is said, \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy \nneighbor\": harm done by thought is forbidden in the words, \"Thou shalt \nnot covet.\"\nThe three precepts that direct man in his behavior towards God may also \nbe differentiated in this same way. For the first refers to deeds; \nwherefore it is said, \"Thou shalt not make . . . a graven thing\": the \nsecond, to words; wherefore it is said, \"Thou shalt not take the name of \nthe Lord thy God in vain\": the third, to thoughts; because the \nsanctification of the Sabbath, as the subject of a moral precept, \nrequires repose of the heart in God. Or, according to Augustine (In Ps. \n32: Conc. 1), by the first commandment we reverence the unity of the \nFirst Principle; by the second, the Divine truth; by the third, His \ngoodness whereby we are sanctified, and wherein we rest as in our last \nend.",
        "RP1": "This objection may be answered in two ways. First, because \nthe precepts of the decalogue can be reduced to the precepts of charity. \nNow there was need for man to receive a precept about loving God and his \nneighbor, because in this respect the natural law had become obscured on \naccount of sin: but not about the duty of loving oneself, because in this \nrespect the natural law retained its vigor: or again, because love of \noneself is contained in the love of God and of one's neighbor: since true \nself-love consists in directing oneself to God. And for this reason the \ndecalogue includes those precepts only which refer to our  neighbor and \nto God.\nSecondly, it may be answered that the precepts of the decalogue are \nthose which the people received from God immediately; wherefore it is \nwritten (Dt. 10:4): \"He wrote in the tables, according as He had written \nbefore, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you.\" Hence the precepts \nof the decalogue need to be such as the people can understand at once. \nNow a precept implies the notion of duty. But it is easy for a man, \nespecially for a believer, to understand that, of necessity, he owes \ncertain duties to God and to his neighbor. But that, in matters which \nregard himself and not another, man has, of necessity, certain duties to \nhimself, is not so evident: for, at the first glance, it seems that \neveryone is free in matters that concern himself. And therefore the \nprecepts which prohibit disorders of a man with regard to himself, reach \nthe people through the instruction of men who are versed through the \ninstruction of men who are versed in such matters; and, consequently, \nthey are not contained in the decalogue.",
        "RP2": "All the solemnities of the Old Law were instituted in \ncelebration of some Divine favor, either in memory of past favors, or in \nsign of some favor to come: in like manner all the sacrifices were \noffered up with the same purpose. Now of all the Divine favors to be \ncommemorated the chief was that of the Creation, which was called to mind \nby the sanctification of the Sabbath; wherefore the reason for this \nprecept is given in Ex. 20:11: \"In six days the Lord made heaven and \nearth,\" etc. And of all future blessings, the chief and final was the \nrepose of the mind in God, either, in the present life, by grace, or, in \nthe future life, by glory; which repose was also foreshadowed in the \nSabbath-day observance: wherefore it is written (Is. 58:13): \"If thou \nturn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy own will in My holy \nday, and call the Sabbath delightful, and the holy of the Lord glorious.\" \nBecause these favors first and chiefly are borne in mind by men, \nespecially by the faithful. But other solemnities were celebrated on \naccount of certain particular favors temporal and transitory, such as the \ncelebration of the Passover in memory of the past favor of the delivery \nfrom Egypt, and as a sign of the future Passion of Christ, which though \ntemporal and transitory, brought us to the repose of the spiritual \nSabbath. Consequently, the Sabbath alone, and none of the other \nsolemnities and sacrifices, is mentioned in the precepts of the decalogue.",
        "RP3": "As the Apostle says (Heb. 6:16), \"men swear by one greater \nthan themselves; and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their \ncontroversy.\" Hence, since oaths are common to all, inordinate swearing \nis the matter of a special prohibition by a precept of the decalogue. \nAccording to one interpretation, however, the words, \"Thou shalt not take \nthe name of the Lord thy God in vain,\" are a prohibition of false \ndoctrine, for one gloss expounds them thus: \"Thou shalt not say that \nChrist is a creature.\"",
        "RP4": "That a man should not do harm to anyone is an immediate \ndictate of his natural reason: and therefore the precepts  that forbid \nthe doing of harm are binding on all men. But it is not an immediate \ndictate of natural reason that a man should do one thing in return for \nanother, unless he happen to be indebted to someone. Now a son's debt to \nhis father is so evident that one cannot get away from it by denying it: \nsince the father is the principle of generation and being, and also of \nupbringing and teaching. Wherefore the decalogue does not prescribe deeds \nof kindness or service to be done to anyone except to one's parents. On \nthe other hand parents do not seem to be indebted to their children for \nany favors received, but rather the reverse is the case. Again, a child \nis a part of his father; and \"parents love their children as being a part \nof themselves,\" as the Philosopher states (Ethic. viii, 12). Hence, just \nas the decalogue contains no ordinance as to man's behavior towards \nhimself, so, for the same reason, it includes no precept about loving \none's children."

        "ANS": "As stated above (Articles [3],5, ad 1), the precepts of the \ndecalogue are such as the mind of man is ready to grasp at once. Now it \nis evident that a thing is so much the more easily grasped by the reason, \nas its contrary is more grievous and repugnant to reason. Moreover, it is \nclear, since the order of reason begins with the end, that, for a man to \nbe inordinately disposed towards his end, is supremely contrary to \nreason. Now the end of human life and society is God. Consequently it was \nnecessary for the precepts of the decalogue, first of all, to direct man \nto God; since the contrary to this is most grievous. Thus also, in an \narmy, which is ordained to the commander as to its end, it is requisite \nfirst that the soldier should be subject to the commander, and the \nopposite of this is most grievous; and secondly it is requisite that he \nshould be in coordination with the other soldiers.\nNow among those things whereby we are ordained to God, the first is that \nman should be subjected to Him faithfully, by having nothing in common \nwith His enemies. The second is that he should show Him reverence: the \nthird that he should offer Him service. Thus, in an army, it is a greater \nsin for a soldier to act treacherously and make a compact with the foe, \nthan to be insolent to his commander: and this last is more grievous than \nif he be found wanting in some point of service to him.\nAs to the precepts that direct man in his behavior towards his neighbor, \nit is evident that it is more repugnant to reason, and a more grievous \nsin, if man does not observe the due order as to those persons to whom he \nis most indebted. Consequently, among those precepts that direct man in \nhis relations to his neighbor, the first place is given to that one which \nregards his parents. Among the other precepts we again find the order to \nbe according to the gravity of sin. For it is more grave and more \nrepugnant to reason, to sin by deed than by word; and by word than by \nthought. And among sins of deed, murder which destroys life in one \nalready living is more grievous than adultery, which imperils the life of \nthe unborn child; and adultery is more grave than theft, which regards \nexternal goods.",

For although in the order of execution, vices \nshould be uprooted before virtues are sown, according to Ps. 33:15: \"Turn \naway from evil, and do good,\" and Is. 1:16,17: \"Cease to do perversely; \nlearn to do well\"; yet, in the order of knowledge, virtue precedes vice, \nbecause \"the crooked line is known by the straight\" (De Anima i): and \"by \nthe law is the knowledge of sin\" (Rm. 3:20).

Now the mode of \nvirtue consists in three things, as the Philosopher states in Ethic. ii. \nThe first is that man should act \"knowingly\": and this is subject to the \njudgment of both Divine and human law; because what a man does in \nignorance, he does accidentally. Hence according to both human and Divine \nlaw, certain things are judged in respect of ignorance to be punishable \nor pardonable.\nThe second point is that a man should act \"deliberately,\" i.e. \"from \nchoice, choosing that particular action for its own sake\"; wherein a \ntwofold internal movement is implied, of volition and of intention, about \nwhich we have spoken above (Questions [8], 12): and concerning these two, Divine \nlaw alone, and not human law, is competent to judge. For human law does \nnot punish the man who wishes to slay, and slays not: whereas the Divine \nlaw does, according to Mt. 5:22: \"Whosoever is angry with his brother, \nshall be in danger of the judgment.\"\nThe third point is that he should \"act from a firm and  immovable \nprinciple\": which firmness belongs properly to a habit, and implies that \nthe action proceeds from a rooted habit. In this respect, the mode of \nvirtue does not fall under the precept either of Divine or of human law, \nsince neither by man nor by God is he punished as breaking the law, who \ngives due honor to his parents and yet has not the habit of filial piety.",
        "RP1": "The mode of doing acts of justice, which falls under the \nprecept, is that they be done in accordance with right; but not that they \nbe done from the habit of justice.",
        "RP2": "The intention of the lawgiver is twofold. His aim, in the \nfirst place, is to lead men to something by the precepts of the law: and \nthis is virtue. Secondly, his intention is brought to bear on the matter \nitself of the precept: and this is something leading or disposing to \nvirtue, viz. an act of virtue. For the end of the precept and the matter \nof the precept are not the same: just as neither in other things is the \nend the same as that which conduces to the end.",
        "RP3": "That works of virtue should be done without sadness, falls \nunder the precept of the Divine law; for whoever works with sadness works \nunwillingly. But to work with pleasure, i.e. joyfully or cheerfully, in \none respect falls under the precept, viz. in so far as pleasure ensues \nfrom the love of God and one's neighbor (which love falls under the \nprecept), and love causes pleasure: and in another respect does not fall \nunder the precept, in so far as pleasure ensues from a habit; for \n\"pleasure taken in a work proves the existence of a habit,\" as stated in \nEthic. ii, 3. For an act may give pleasure either on account of its end, \nor through its proceeding from a becoming habit."

        "question": "Whether the mode of charity falls under the precept of the Divine law?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that the mode of charity falls under the precept of \nthe Divine law. For it is written (Mt. 19:17): \"If thou wilt enter into \nlife, keep the commandments\": whence it seems to follow that the \nobservance of the commandments suffices for entrance into life. But good \nworks do not suffice for entrance into life, except they be done from \ncharity: for it is written (1 Cor. 13:3): \"If I should distribute all my \ngoods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and \nhave not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\" Therefore the mode of charity \nis included in the commandment.",
        "OB2": "Further, the mode of charity consists properly speaking in doing \nall things for God. But this falls under the precept; for the Apostle \nsays (1 Cor. 10:31): \"Do all to the glory of God.\" Therefore the mode of \ncharity falls under the precept.",
        "OB3": "Further, if the mode of charity does not fall under the precept, \nit follows that one can fulfil the precepts of the law  without having \ncharity. Now what can be done without charity can be done without grace, \nwhich is always united to charity. Therefore one can fulfil the precepts \nof the law without grace. But this is the error of Pelagius, as Augustine \ndeclares (De Haeres. lxxxviii). Therefore the mode of charity is included \nin the commandment.",
        "CON": "Whoever breaks a commandment sins mortally. If \ntherefore the mode of charity falls under the precept, it follows that \nwhoever acts otherwise than from charity sins mortally. But whoever has \nnot charity, acts otherwise than from charity. Therefore it follows that \nwhoever has not charity, sins mortally in whatever he does, however good \nthis may be in itself: which is absurd.",
        "ANS": "Opinions have been contrary on this question. For some \nhave said absolutely that the mode of charity comes under the precept; \nand yet that it is possible for one not having charity to fulfil this \nprecept: because he can dispose himself to receive charity from God. Nor \n(say they) does it follow that a man not having charity sins mortally \nwhenever he does something good of its kind: because it is an affirmative \nprecept that binds one to act from charity, and is binding not for all \ntime, but only for such time as one is in a state of charity. On the \nother hand, some have said that the mode of charity is altogether outside \nthe precept.\nBoth these opinions are true up to a certain point. Because the act of \ncharity can be considered in two ways. First, as an act by itself: and \nthus it falls under the precept of the law which specially prescribes it, \nviz. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,\" and \"Thou shalt love thy \nneighbor.\" In this sense, the first opinion is true. Because it is not \nimpossible to observe this precept which regards the act of charity; \nsince man can dispose himself to possess charity, and when he possesses \nit, he can use it. Secondly, the act of charity can be considered as \nbeing the mode of the acts of the other virtues, i.e. inasmuch as the \nacts of the other virtues are ordained to charity, which is \"the end of \nthe commandment,\" as stated in 1 Tim. i, 5: for it has been said above \n(Question [12], Article [4]) that the intention of the end is a formal mode of the act \nordained to that end. In this sense the second opinion is true in saying \nthat the mode of charity does not fall under the precept, that is to say \nthat this commandment, \"Honor thy father,\" does not mean that a man must \nhonor his father from charity, but merely that he must honor him. \nWherefore he that honors his father, yet has not charity, does not break \nthis precept: although he does break the precept concerning the act of \ncharity, for which reason he deserves to be punished.",

Wherefore he that honors \nhis father and mother, is bound to honor them from charity, not in virtue \nof the precept, \"Honor thy father and mother,\" but in virtue of the \nprecept, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart.\" And \nsince these are two affirmative precepts, not binding for all times, they \ncan be binding, each one at a different time: so that it may happen that \na man fulfils the precept of honoring his father and mother, without at \nthe same time breaking the precept concerning the omission of the mode of \ncharity.",

But the moral \nprecepts derive their efficacy from the very dictate of natural reason, \neven if they were never included in the Law. Now of these there are three \ngrades: for some are most certain, and so evident as to need no \npromulgation; such as the commandments of the love of God and our \nneighbor, and others like these, as stated above (Article [3]), which are, as it \nwere, the ends of the commandments; wherefore no man can have an \nerroneous judgment about them. Some precepts are more detailed, the \nreason of which even an uneducated man can easily grasp; and yet they \nneed to be promulgated, because human judgment, in a few instances, \nhappens to be led astray concerning them: these are the precepts of the \ndecalogue. Again, there are some precepts the reason of which is not so \nevident to everyone, but only the wise; these are moral precepts added to \nthe decalogue, and given to the people by God through Moses and Aaron.\nBut since the things that are evident are the principles whereby we know \nthose that are not evident, these other moral precepts added to the \ndecalogue are reducible to the precepts of the decalogue, as so many \ncorollaries. Thus the first commandment of the decalogue forbids the \nworship of strange gods: and to this are added other precepts forbidding \nthings relating to worship of idols: thus it is written (Dt. 18:10,11): \n\"Neither let there be found among you anyone that shall expiate his son \nor daughter, making them to pass through the fire: . . . neither let \nthere by any wizard nor charmer, nor anyone that consulteth pythonic \nspirits, or fortune-tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead.\" \nThe second commandment forbids perjury.

If justice be taken in \nthe last two ways, it is evident that it was conferred by the precepts of \nthe Law; in so far, to wit, as they disposed men to the justifying grace \nof Christ, which they also signified, because as Augustine says (Contra \nFaust. xxii, 24), \"even the life of that people foretold and foreshadowed \nChrist.\"\nBut if we speak of justification properly so called, then we must notice \nthat it can be considered as in the habit or as in the act: so that \naccordingly justification may be taken in two ways. First, according as \nman is made just, by becoming possessed of the habit of justice: \nsecondly, according as he does works of justice, so that in this sense \njustification is nothing else than the execution of justice. Now justice, \nlike the other virtues, may denote either the acquired or the infused \nvirtue, as is clear from what has been stated (Question [63], Article [4]). The acquired \nvirtue is caused by works; but the infused virtue is caused by God \nHimself through His grace. The latter is true justice, of which we are \nspeaking now, and in this respect of which a man is said to be just \nbefore God, according to Rm. 4:2: \"If Abraham were justified by works, he \nhath whereof to glory, but not before God.\" Hence this justice could not \nbe caused by moral precepts, which are about human actions: wherefore the \nmoral precepts could not justify man by causing justice.\nIf, on the other hand, by justification we understand the execution of \njustice, thus all the precepts of the Law justified man, but in various \nways. Because the ceremonial precepts taken as a whole contained \nsomething just in itself, in so far as they aimed at offering worship to \nGod; whereas taken individually they contained that which is just, not in \nitself, but by being a determination of the Divine law. Hence it is said \nof these precepts that they did not justify man save through the devotion \nand obedience of those who complied with them. On the other hand the \nmoral and judicial precepts, either in general or also in particular, \ncontained that which is just in itself: but the moral precepts contained \nthat which is just in itself according to that \"general justice\" which is \n\"every virtue\" according to Ethic. v, 1: whereas the judicial precepts \nbelonged to \"special justice,\" which is about contracts connected with \nthe human mode of life, between one man and another.",

Because those things that are done for the \npurpose of divine worship should not be like the observances of \nidolaters: since it is written (Dt. 12:31): \"Thou shalt not do in like \nmanner to the Lord thy God: for they have done to their gods all the \nabominations which the Lord abhorreth.\" Now worshippers of idols used to \nknive themselves to the shedding of blood: for it is related (3 Kgs. 18:28) that they \"cut themselves after their manner with knives and \nlancets, till they were all covered with blood.\" For this reason the Lord \ncommanded (Dt. 14:1): \"You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness \nfor the dead.\" Therefore it was unfitting for circumcision to be \nprescribed by the Law (Lev. 12:3).\n: Further, as stated in 1 Kgs. 16:7, \"Man seeth those things that \nappear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.\" But those things that appear \noutwardly in man are the dispositions of his body and his clothes. \nTherefore it was unfitting for certain special garments to be appointed \nto the higher and lower priests, as related in Ex. 28 [*Cf. Lev. 8:7, \nseqq.]. It seems, moreover, unreasonable that anyone should be debarred \nfrom the priesthood on account of defects in the body, as stated in Lev. \n21:17, seqq.: \"Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families, hath a \nblemish, he shall not offer bread to his God . . . if he be blind, if he \nbe lame,\" etc. It seems, therefore, that the sacraments of the Old Law \nwere unreasonable.",

Therefore it was unfittingly \ncommanded (Ex. 12:11) that they should eat the Paschal lamb \"in haste.\" \nOther things too relative to the eating of the lamb were prescribed, \nwhich seem altogether unreasonable.",

        "OB4": "Further, purification can scarcely be done except by removing \nsomething impure. But as far as God is concerned, no bodily thing is \nreputed impure, because all bodies are God's creatures; and \"every \ncreature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with \nthanksgiving\" (1 Tim. 4:4).

        "OB5": "Further, it is written (Ecclus. 34:4): \"What can be made clean by \nthe unclean?\" But the ashes of the red heifer [*Cf. Heb. 9:13] which was \nburnt, were unclean, since they made a man unclean: for it is stated \n(Num. 19:7, seqq.) that the priest who immolated her was rendered unclean \n\"until the evening\"; likewise he that burnt her; and he that gathered up \nher ashes.

It was therefore unfitting for the purpose of \nexpiating the sins of the people that the priest should confess the sins \nof the children of Israel on one of the buck-goats, that it might carry \nthem away into the wilderness: while they were rendered unclean by the \nother, which they used for the purpose of purification, by burning it \ntogether with the calf outside the camp; so that they had to wash their \nclothes and their bodies with water (Lev. 16).\nObjection 7: Further, what is already cleansed should not be cleansed again. \nIt was therefore unfitting to apply a second purification to a man \ncleansed from leprosy, or to a house; as laid down in Lev. 14.\nObjection 8: Further, spiritual uncleanness cannot be cleansed by material \nwater or by shaving the hair. Therefore it seems unreasonable that the \nLord ordered (Ex. 30:18, seqq.) the making of a brazen laver with its \nfoot, that the priests might wash their hands and feet before entering \nthe temple; and that He commanded (Num. 8:7) the Levites to be sprinkled \nwith the water of purification, and to shave all the hairs of their flesh.\nObjection 9: Further, that which is greater cannot be cleansed by that which \nis less. Therefore it was unfitting that, in the Law, the higher and \nlower priests, as stated in Lev. 8 [*Cf. Ex. 29], and the Levites, \naccording to Num. 8, should be consecrated with any bodily anointing, \nbodily sacrifices, and bodily oblations.\nReply to  As stated above (ad 4), there was a twofold uncleanness in \nthe Law; one by way of corruption in the mind or in the body; and this \nwas the graver uncleanness; the other was by mere contact with an unclean \nthing, and this was less grave, and was more easily expiated. Because the \nformer uncleanness was  expiated by sacrifices for sins, since all \ncorruption is due to sin, and signifies sin: whereas the latter \nuncleanness was expiated by the mere sprinkling of a certain water, of \nwhich water we read in Num. 19. For there God commanded them to take a \nred cow in memory of the sin they had committed in worshipping a calf. \nAnd a cow is mentioned rather than a calf, because it was thus that the \nLord was wont to designate the synagogue, according to Osee 4:16: \"Israel \nhath gone astray like a wanton heifer\": and this was, perhaps, because \nthey worshipped heifers after the custom of Egypt, according to Osee \n10:5: \"(They) have worshipped the kine of Bethaven.\" And in detestation \nof the sin of idolatry it was sacrificed outside the camp; in fact, \nwhenever sacrifice was offered up in expiation of the multitude of sins, \nit was all burnt outside the camp. Moreover, in order to show that this \nsacrifice cleansed the people from all their sins, \"the priest\" dipped \n\"his finger in her blood,\" and sprinkled \"it over against the door of the \ntabernacle seven times\"; for the number seven signified universality. \nFurther, the very sprinkling of blood pertained to the detestation of \nidolatry, in which the blood that was offered up was not poured out, but \nwas collected together, and men gathered round it to eat in honor of the \nidols. Likewise it was burnt by fire, either because God appeared to \nMoses in a fire, and the Law was given from the midst of fire; or to \ndenote that idolatry, together with all that was connected therewith, was \nto be extirpated altogether; just as the cow was burnt \"with her skin and \nher flesh, her blood and dung being delivered to the flames.\" To this \nburning were added \"cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet twice dyed,\" to \nsignify that just as cedar-wood is not liable to putrefaction, and \nscarlet twice dyed does not easily lose its color, and hyssop retains its \nodor after it has been dried; so also was this sacrifice for the \npreservation of the whole people, and for their good behavior and \ndevotion. Hence it is said of the ashes of the cow: \"That they may be \nreserved for the multitude of the children of Israel.\" Or, according to \nJosephus (Antiq. iii, 8,9,10), the four elements are indicated here: for \n\"cedar-wood\" was added to the fire, to signify the earth, on account of \nits earthiness; \"hyssop,\" to signify the air, on account of its smell; \n\"scarlet twice dyed,\" to signify water, for the same reason as purple, on \naccount of the dyes which are taken out of the water: thus denoting the \nfact that this sacrifice was offered to the Creator of the four elements. \nAnd since this sacrifice was offered for the sin of idolatry, both \"he \nthat burned her,\" and \"he that gathered up the ashes,\" and \"he that \nsprinkled the water\" in which the ashes were placed, were deemed unclean \nin detestation of that sin, in order to show that whatever was in any way \nconnected with idolatry should be cast aside as being unclean. From this \nuncleanness they were purified by the mere washing of their clothes; nor \ndid they need to be sprinkled with the water on account of this kind of \nuncleanness, because otherwise the process would have been unending, \nsince he that sprinkled the water became unclean, so that if he were to \nsprinkle himself he would remain unclean; and if another were to sprinkle \nhim, that one would have become unclean, and in like manner, whoever \nmight sprinkle him, and so on indefinitely.\nThe figurative reason of this sacrifice was that the red cow signified \nChrist in respect his assumed weakness, denoted by the female sex; while \nthe color of the cow designated the blood of His Passion. And the \"red \ncow was of full age,\" because all Christ's works are perfect, \"in which \nthere\" was \"no blemish\"; \"and which\" had \"not carried the yoke,\" because \nChrist was innocent, nor did He carry the yoke of sin. It was commanded \nto be taken to Moses, because they blamed Him for transgressing the law \nof Moses by breaking the Sabbath. And it was commanded to be delivered \n\"to Eleazar the priest,\" because Christ was delivered into the hands of \nthe priests to be slain. It was immolated \"without the camp,\" because \nChrist \"suffered outside the gate\" (Heb. 13:12). And the priest dipped \n\"his finger in her blood,\" because the mystery of Christ's Passion should \nbe considered and imitated.\nIt was sprinkled \"over against . . . the tabernacle,\" which denotes the \nsynagogue, to signify either the condemnation of the unbelieving Jews, or \nthe purification of believers; and this \"seven times,\" in token either of \nthe seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, or of the seven days wherein all time \nis comprised. Again, all things that pertain to the Incarnation of Christ \nshould be burnt with fire, i.e. they should be understood spiritually; \nfor the \"skin\" and \"flesh\" signified Christ's outward works; the \"blood\" \ndenoted the subtle inward force which quickened His external deeds; the \n\"dung\" betokened His weariness, His thirst, and all such like things \npertaining to His weakness. Three things were added, viz. \"cedar-wood,\" \nwhich denotes the height of hope or contemplation; \"hyssop,\" in token of \nhumility or faith; \"scarlet twice dyed,\" which denotes twofold charity; \nfor it is by these three that we should cling to Christ suffering. The \nashes of this burning were gathered by \"a man that is clean,\" because the \nrelics of the Passion came into the possession of the Gentiles, who were \nnot guilty of Christ's death. The ashes were put into water for the \npurpose of expiation, because Baptism receives from Christ's Passion the \npower of washing away sins. The priest who immolated and burned the cow, \nand he who burned, and he who gathered together the ashes, were unclean, \nas also he that sprinkled the water: either because the Jews became \nunclean through putting Christ to death, whereby our sins are expiated; \nand this, until the evening, i.e. until the end of the world, when the \nremnants of Israel will be converted; or else because they who handle \nsacred things with a view to the cleansing of others contract certain \nuncleannesses, as Gregory says (Pastor. ii, 5); and this until the \nevening, i.e. until the end of this life.\nReply to Objection 6: As stated above (ad 5), an uncleanness which was caused by \ncorruption either of mind or of body was expiated by sin-offerings. Now \nspecial sacrifices were wont to be offered for the sins of individuals: \nbut since some were neglectful about expiating such sins and \nuncleannesses; or, through ignorance, failed to offer this expiation; it \nwas laid down that once a year, on the tenth day of the seventh month, a \nsacrifice of expiation should be offered for the whole people. And \nbecause, as the Apostle  says (Heb. 7:28), \"the Law maketh men priests, \nwho have infirmity,\" it behooved the priest first of all to offer a calf \nfor his own sins, in memory of Aaron's sin in fashioning the molten calf; \nand besides, to offer a ram for a holocaust, which signified that the \npriestly sovereignty denoted by the ram, who is the head of the flock, \nwas to be ordained to the glory of God. Then he offered two he-goats for \nthe people: one of which was offered in expiation of the sins of the \nmultitude. For the he-goat is an evil-smelling animal; and from its skin \nclothes are made having a pungent odor; to signify the stench, \nuncleanness and the sting of sin. After this he-goat had been immolated, \nits blood was taken, together with the blood of the calf, into the Holy \nof Holies, and the entire sanctuary was sprinkled with it; to signify \nthat the tabernacle was cleansed from the uncleanness of the children of \nIsrael. But the corpses of the he-goat and calf which had been offered up \nfor sin had to be burnt, to denote the destruction of sins. They were \nnot, however, burnt on the altar: since none but holocausts were burnt \nthereon; but it was prescribed that they should be burnt without the \ncamp, in detestation of sin: for this was done whenever sacrifice was \noffered for a grievous sin, or for the multitude of sins. The other goat \nwas let loose into the wilderness: not indeed to offer it to the demons, \nwhom the Gentiles worshipped in desert places, because it was unlawful to \noffer aught to them; but in order to point out the effect of the \nsacrifice which had been offered up. Hence the priest put his hand on its \nhead, while confessing the sins of the children of Israel: as though that \ngoat were to carry them away into the wilderness, where it would be \ndevoured by wild beasts, because it bore the punishment of the people's \nsins. And it was said to bear the sins of the people, either because the \nforgiveness of the people's sins was signified by its being let loose, or \nbecause on its head written lists of sins were fastened.\nThe figurative reason of these things was that Christ was foreshadowed \nboth by the calf, on account of His power; and by the ram, because He is \nthe Head of the faithful; and by the he-goat, on account of \"the likeness \nof sinful flesh\" (Rm. 8:3). Moreover, Christ was sacrificed for the sins \nof both priests and people: since both those of high and those of low \ndegree are cleansed from sin by His Passion. The blood of the calf and of \nthe goat was brought into the Holies by the priest, because the entrance \nto the kingdom of heaven was opened to us by the blood of Christ's \nPassion. Their bodies were burnt without the camp, because \"Christ \nsuffered without the gate,\" as the Apostle declares (Heb. 13:12). The \nscape-goat may denote either Christ's Godhead Which went away into \nsolitude when the Man Christ suffered, not by going to another place, but \nby restraining His power: or it may signify the base concupiscence which \nwe ought to cast away from ourselves, while we offer up to Our Lord acts \nof virtue.\nWith regard to the uncleanness contracted by those who burnt these \nsacrifices, the reason is the same as that which we assigned (ad 5) to \nthe sacrifice of the red heifer.\nReply to Objection 7: The legal rite did not cleanse the leper of his deformity, \nbut declared him to be cleansed. This is shown by the words of Lev. 14:3, \nseqq., where it was said that the priest, \"when he shall find that the \nleprosy is cleansed,\" shall command \"him that is to be purified\": \nconsequently, the leper was already healed: but he was said to be \npurified in so far as the verdict of the priest restored him to the \nsociety of men and to the worship of God. It happened sometimes, however, \nthat bodily leprosy was miraculously cured by the legal rite, when the \npriest erred in his judgment.\nNow this purification of a leper was twofold: for, in the first place, \nhe was declared to be clean; and, secondly, he was restored, as clean, to \nthe society of men and to the worship of God, to wit, after seven days. \nAt the first purification the leper who sought to be cleansed offered for \nhimself \"two living sparrows . . . cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop,\" \nin such wise that a sparrow and the hyssop should be tied to the \ncedar-wood with a scarlet thread, so that the cedar-wood was like the \nhandle of an aspersory: while the hyssop and sparrow were that part of \nthe aspersory which was dipped into the blood of the other sparrow which \nwas \"immolated . . . over living waters.\" These things he offered as an \nantidote to the four defects of leprosy: for cedar-wood, which is not \nsubject to putrefaction, was offered against the putrefaction; hyssop, \nwhich is a sweet-smelling herb, was offered up against the stench; a \nliving sparrow was offered up against numbness; and scarlet, which has a \nvivid color, was offered up against the repulsive color of leprosy. The \nliving sparrow was let loose to fly away into the plain, because the \nleper was restored to his former liberty.\nOn the eighth day he was admitted to divine worship, and was restored to \nthe society of men; but only after having shaved all the hair of his \nbody, and washed his clothes, because leprosy rots the hair, infects the \nclothes, and gives them an evil smell. Afterwards a sacrifice was offered \nfor his sin, since leprosy was frequently a result of sin: and some of \nthe blood of the sacrifice was put on the tip of the ear of the man that \nwas to be cleansed, \"and on the thumb of his right hand, and the great \ntoe of his right foot\"; because it is in these parts that leprosy is \nfirst diagnosed and felt. In this rite, moreover, three liquids were \nemployed: viz. blood, against the corruption of the blood; oil, to denote \nthe healing of the disease; and living waters, to wash away the filth.\nThe figurative reason was that the Divine and human natures in Christ \nwere denoted by the two sparrows, one of which, in likeness of His human \nnature, was offered up in an earthen vessel over living waters, because \nthe waters of Baptism are sanctified by Christ's Passion. The other \nsparrow, in token of His impassible Godhead, remained living, because the \nGodhead cannot die: hence it flew away, for the Godhead could not be \nencompassed by the Passion. Now this living sparrow, together with the \ncedar-wood and scarlet or cochineal, and hyssop, i.e. faith, hope and \ncharity, as stated above (ad 5), was put into the water for the purpose \nof sprinkling, because we are baptized in the faith of the God-Man. By \nthe waters  of Baptism or of his tears man washes his clothes, i.e. his \nworks, and all his hair, i.e. his thoughts. The tip of the right ear of \nthe man to be cleansed is moistened with some the blood and oil, in order \nto strengthen his hearing against harmful words; and the thumb and toe of \nhis right hand and foot are moistened that his deeds may be holy. Other \nmatters pertaining to this purification, or to that also of any other \nuncleannesses, call for no special remark, beyond what applies to other \nsacrifices, whether for sins or for trespasses.\nReply to Objection 8:and 9: Just as the people were initiated by circumcision to \nthe divine worship, so were the ministers by some special purification or \nconsecration: wherefore they are commanded to be separated from other \nmen, as being specially deputed, rather than others, to the ministry of \nthe divine worship. And all that was done touching them in their \nconsecration or institution, was with a view to show that they were in \npossession of a prerogative of purity, power and dignity. Hence three \nthings were done in the institution of ministers: for first, they were \npurified; secondly, they were adorned [*'Ornabantur.' Some editions have \n'ordinabantur'---'were ordained': the former reading is a reference to \nLev. 8:7-9] and consecrated; thirdly, they were employed in the ministry. \nAll in general used to be purified by washing in water, and by certain \nsacrifices; but the Levites in particular shaved all the hair of their \nbodies, as stated in Lev. 8 (cf. Num. 8).\nWith regard to the high-priests and priests the consecration was \nperformed as follows. First, when they had been washed, they were clothed \nwith certain special garments in designation of their dignity. In \nparticular, the high-priest was anointed on the head with the oil of \nunction: to denote that the power of consecration was poured forth by him \non to others, just as oil flows from the head on to the lower parts of \nthe body; according to Ps. 132:2: \"Like the precious ointment on the head \nthat ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron.\" But the Levites \nreceived no other consecration besides being offered to the Lord by the \nchildren of Israel through the hands of the high-priest, who prayed for \nthem. The lesser priests were consecrated on the hands only, which were \nto be employed in the sacrifices. The tip of their right ear and the \nthumb of their right hand, and the great toe of their right foot were \ntinged with the blood of the sacrificial animal, to denote that they \nshould be obedient to God's law in offering the sacrifices (this is \ndenoted by touching their right ear); and that they should be careful and \nready in performing the sacrifices (this is signified by the moistening \nof the right foot and hand). They themselves and their garments were \nsprinkled with the blood of the animal that had been sacrificed, in \nmemory of the blood of the lamb by which they had been delivered in \nEgypt. At their consecration the following sacrifices were offered: a \ncalf, for sin, in memory of Aaron's sin in fashioning the molten calf; a \nram, for a holocaust, in memory of the sacrifice of Abraham, whose \nobedience it behooved the high-priest to imitate; again, a ram of \nconsecration, which was a peace-offering, in memory of the delivery form \nEgypt through the blood of the lamb; and a basket of bread, in  memory of \nthe manna vouchsafed to the people.\nIn reference to their being destined to the ministry, the fat of the \nram, one roll of bread, and the right shoulder were placed on their \nhands, to show that they received the power of offering these things to \nthe Lord: while the Levites were initiated to the ministry by being \nbrought into the tabernacle of the covenant, as being destined to the \nministry touching the vessels of the sanctuary.\nThe figurative reason of these things was that those who are to be \nconsecrated to the spiritual ministry of Christ, should be first of all \npurified by the waters of Baptism, and by the waters of tears, in their \nfaith in Christ's Passion, which is a sacrifice both of expiation and of \npurification. They have also to shave all the hair of their body, i.e. \nall evil thoughts. They should, moreover, be decked with virtues, and be \nconsecrated with the oil of the Holy Ghost, and with the sprinkling of \nChrist's blood. And thus they should be intent on the fulfilment of their \nspiritual ministry.",
        "CON": "It is written (Lev. 20:8): \"I am the Lord that sanctify \nyou.\" But nothing unreasonable is done by God, for it is written (Ps. 103:24): \"Thou hast made all things in wisdom.\" Therefore there was \nnothing without a reasonable cause in the sacraments of the Old Law, \nwhich were ordained to the sanctification of man.",
        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [101], Article [4]), the sacraments are, \nproperly speaking, things applied to the worshippers of God for their \nconsecration so as, in some way, to depute them to the worship of God. \nNow the worship of God belonged in a general way to the whole people; but \nin a special way, it belonged to the priests and Levites, who were the \nministers of divine worship.  Consequently, in these sacraments of the \nOld Law, certain things concerned the whole people in general; while \nothers belonged to the ministers.\nIn regard to both, three things were necessary. The first was to be \nestablished in the state of worshipping God: and this institution was \nbrought about---for all in general, by circumcision, without which no one \nwas admitted to any of the legal observances---and for the priests, by \ntheir consecration. The second thing required was the use of those things \nthat pertain to divine worship. And thus, as to the people, there was the \npartaking of the paschal banquet, to which no uncircumcised man was \nadmitted, as is clear from Ex. 12:43, seqq.: and, as to the priests, the \noffering of the victims, and the eating of the loaves of proposition and \nof other things that were allotted to the use of the priests. The third \nthing required was the removal of all impediments to divine worship, viz. \nof uncleannesses. And then, as to the people, certain purifications were \ninstituted for the removal of certain external uncleannesses; and also \nexpiations from sins; while, as to the priests and Levites, the washing \nof hands and feet and the shaving of the hair were instituted.\nAnd all these things had reasonable causes, both literal, in so far as \nthey were ordained to the worship of God for the time being, and \nfigurative, in so far as they were ordained to foreshadow Christ: as we \nshall see by taking them one by one.",
        "RP1": "The chief literal reason for circumcision was in order that \nman might profess his belief in one God. And because Abraham was the \nfirst to sever himself from the infidels, by going out from his house and \nkindred, for this reason he was the first to receive circumcision. This \nreason is set forth by the Apostle (Rm. 4:9, seqq.) thus: \"He received \nthe sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which he \nhad, being uncircumcised\"; because, to wit, we are told that \"unto \nAbraham faith was reputed to justice,\" for the reason that \"against hope \nhe believed in hope,\" i.e. against the hope that is of nature he believed \nin the hope that is of grace, \"that he might be made the father of many \nnations,\" when he was an old man, and his wife an old and barren woman. \nAnd in order that this declaration, and imitation of Abraham's faith, \nmight be fixed firmly in the hearts of the Jews, they received in their \nflesh such a sign as they could not forget, wherefore it is written (Gn. 17:13): \"My covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.\" \nThis was done on the eighth day, because until then a child is very \ntender, and so might be seriously injured; and is considered as something \nnot yet consolidated: wherefore neither are animals offered before the \neighth day. And it was not delayed after that time, lest some might \nrefuse the sign of circumcision on account of the pain: and also lest the \nparents, whose love for their children increases as they become used to \ntheir presence and as they grow older, should withdraw their children \nfrom circumcision. A second reason may have been the weakening of \nconcupiscence in that member. A third motive may have been to revile the \nworship of Venus and Priapus, which  gave honor to that part of the body. \nThe Lord's prohibition extended only to the cutting of oneself in honor \nof idols: and such was not the circumcision of which we have been \nspeaking.\nThe figurative reason for circumcision was that it foreshadowed the \nremoval of corruption, which was to be brought about by Christ, and will \nbe perfectly fulfilled in the eighth age, which is the age of those who \nrise from the dead. And since all corruption of guilt and punishment \ncomes to us through our carnal origin, from the sin of our first parent, \ntherefore circumcision was applied to the generative member. Hence the \nApostle says (Col. 2:11): \"You are circumcised\" in Christ \"with \ncircumcision not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but \nin the circumcision of\" Our Lord Jesus \"Christ.\"\n: As already stated (Article [4]), the purpose of the Law was to \ninduce men to have reverence for the divine worship: and this in two \nways; first, by excluding from the worship of God whatever might be an \nobject of contempt; secondly, by introducing into the divine worship all \nthat seemed to savor of reverence. And, indeed, if this was observed in \nregard to the tabernacle and its vessels, and in the animals to be \nsacrificed, much more was it to be observed in the very ministers. \nWherefore, in order to obviate contempt for the ministers, it was \nprescribed that they should have no bodily stain or defect: since men so \ndeformed are wont to be despised by others. For the same reason it was \nalso commanded that the choice of those who were to be destined to the \nservice of God was not to be made in a broadcast manner from any family, \nbut according to their descent from one particular stock, thus giving \nthem distinction and nobility.\nIn order that they might be revered, special ornate vestments were \nappointed for their use, and a special form of consecration. This indeed \nis the general reason of ornate garments. But the high-priest in \nparticular had eight vestments. First, he had a linen tunic. Secondly, he \nhad a purple tunic; round the bottom of which were placed \"little bells\" \nand \"pomegranates of violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed.\" \nThirdly, he had the ephod, which covered his shoulders and his breast \ndown to the girdle; and it was made of gold, and violet and purple, and \nscarlet twice dyed and twisted linen: and on his shoulders he bore two \nonyx stones, on which were graven the names of the children of Israel. \nFourthly, he had the rational, made of the same material; it was square \nin shape, and was worn on the breast, and was fastened to the ephod. On \nthis rational there were twelve precious stones set in four rows, on \nwhich also were graven the names of the children of Israel, in token that \nthe priest bore the burden of the whole people, since he bore their names \non his shoulders; and that it was  his duty ever to think of their \nwelfare, since he wore them on his breast, bearing them in his heart, so \nto speak. And the Lord commanded the \"Doctrine and Truth\" to be put in \nthe rational: for certain matters regarding moral and dogmatic truth were \nwritten on it. The Jews indeed pretend that on the rational was placed a \nstone which changed color according to the various things which were \nabout to happen to the children of Israel: and this they call the \"Truth \nand Doctrine.\" Fifthly, he wore a belt or girdle made of the four colors \nmentioned above. Sixthly, there was the tiara or mitre which was made of \nlinen. Seventhly, there was the golden plate which hung over his \nforehead; on it was inscribed the Lord's name. Eighthly, there were \"the \nlinen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness,\" when they went up \nto the sanctuary or altar. Of these eight vestments the lesser priests \nhad four, viz. the linen tunic and breeches, the belt and the tiara.\nAccording to some, the literal reason for these vestments was that they \ndenoted the disposition of the terrestrial globe; as though the \nhigh-priest confessed himself to be the minister of the Creator of the \nworld, wherefore it is written (Wis. 18:24): \"In the robe\" of Aaron \"was \nthe whole world\" described. For the linen breeches signified the earth \nout of which the flax grows. The surrounding belt signified the ocean \nwhich surrounds the earth. The violet tunic denoted the air by its color: \nits little bells betoken the thunder; the pomegranates, the lightning. \nThe ephod, by its many colors, signified the starry heaven; the two onyx \nstones denoted the two hemispheres, or the sun and moon. The twelve \nprecious stones on the breast are the twelve signs of the zodiac: and \nthey are said to have been placed on the rational because in heaven, are \nthe types [rationes] of earthly things, according to Job 38:33: \"Dost \nthou know the order of heaven, and canst thou set down the reason \n[rationem] thereof on the earth?\" The turban or tiara signified the \nempyrean: the golden plate was a token of God, the governor of the \nuniverse.\nThe figurative reason is evident. Because bodily stains or defects \nwherefrom the priests had to be immune, signify the various vices and \nsins from which they should be free. Thus it is forbidden that he should \nbe blind, i.e. he ought not to be ignorant: he must not be lame, i.e. \nvacillating and uncertain of purpose: that he must have \"a little, or a \ngreat, or a crooked nose,\" i.e. that he should not, from lack of \ndiscretion, exceed in one direction or in another, or even exercise some \nbase occupation: for the nose signifies discretion, because it discerns \nodors. It is forbidden that he should have \"a broken foot\" or \"hand,\" \ni.e. he should not lose the power of doing good works or of advancing in \nvirtue. He is rejected, too, if he have a swelling either in front or \nbehind [Vulg.: 'if he be crook-backed']: by which is signified too much \nlove of earthly things: if he be blear-eyed, i.e. if his mind is darkened \nby carnal affections: for running of the eyes is caused by a flow of \nmatter. He is also rejected if he had \"a pearl in his eye,\" i.e. if he \npresumes in his own estimation that he is clothed in the white robe of \nrighteousness. Again, he is rejected \"if he have a continued scab,\" i.e. \nlustfulness of the flesh: also, if he  have \"a dry scurf,\" which covers \nthe body without giving pain, and is a blemish on the comeliness of the \nmembers; which denotes avarice. Lastly, he is rejected \"if he have a \nrupture\" or hernia; through baseness rending his heart, though it appear \nnot in his deeds.\nThe vestments denote the virtues of God's ministers. Now there are four \nthings that are necessary to all His ministers, viz. chastity denoted by \nthe breeches; a pure life, signified by the linen tunic; the moderation \nof discretion, betokened by the girdle; and rectitude of purpose, denoted \nby the mitre covering the head. But the high-priests needed four other \nthings in addition to these. First, a continual recollection of God in \ntheir thoughts; and this was signified by the golden plate worn over the \nforehead, with the name of God engraved thereon. Secondly, they had to \nbear with the shortcomings of the people: this was denoted by the ephod \nwhich they bore on their shoulders. Thirdly, they had to carry the people \nin their mind and heart by the solicitude of charity, in token of which \nthey wore the rational. Fourthly, they had to lead a godly life by \nperforming works of perfection; and this was signified by the violet \ntunic. Hence little golden bells were fixed to the bottom of the violet \ntunic, which bells signified the teaching of divine things united in the \nhigh-priest to his godly mode of life. In addition to these were the \npomegranates, signifying unity of faith and concord in good morals: \nbecause his doctrine should hold together in such a way that it should \nnot rend asunder the unity of faith and peace.",
        "RP2": "The literal reason of the paschal banquet was to \ncommemorate the blessing of being led by God out of Egypt. Hence by \ncelebrating this banquet they declared that they belonged to that people \nwhich God had taken to Himself out of Egypt. For when they were delivered \nfrom Egypt, they were commanded to sprinkle the lamb's blood on the \ntransoms of their house doors, as though declaring that they were averse \nto the rites of the Egyptians who worshipped the ram. Wherefore they were \ndelivered by the sprinkling or rubbing of the blood of the lamb on the \ndoor-posts, from the danger of extermination which threatened the \nEgyptians.\nNow two things are to be observed in their departure from Egypt: namely, \ntheir haste in going, for the Egyptians pressed them to go forth \nspeedily, as related in Ex. 12:33; and there was danger that anyone who \ndid not hasten to go with the crowd might be slain by the Egyptians. \nTheir haste was shown in two ways. First by what they ate. For they were \ncommanded to eat unleavened bread, as a sign \"that it could not be \nleavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart\"; and to eat roast meat, \nfor this took less time to prepare; and that they should not break a bone \nthereof, because in their haste there was no time to break bones. \nSecondly, as to the manner of eating. For it is written: \"You shall gird \nyour reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your \nhands, and you shall eat in haste\": which clearly designates men at the \npoint of starting on a journey. To this also is to be referred the \ncommand: \"In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth \nof the flesh thereof out of the house\": because, to wit, on account of \ntheir haste, they could not send any gifts of it.\nThe stress they suffered while in Egypt was denoted by the wild \nlettuces. The figurative reason is evident, because the sacrifice of the \npaschal lamb signified the sacrifice of Christ according to 1 Cor. 5:7: \n\"Christ our pasch is sacrificed.\" The blood of the lamb, which ensured \ndeliverance from the destroyer, by being sprinkled on the transoms, \nsignified faith in Christ's Passion, in the hearts and on the lips of the \nfaithful, by which same Passion we are delivered from sin and death, \naccording to 1 Pt. 1:18: \"You were . . . redeemed . . . with the precious \nblood . . . of a lamb unspotted.\" The partaking of its flesh signified \nthe  eating of Christ's body in the Sacrament; and the flesh was roasted \nat the fire to signify Christ's Passion or charity. And it was eaten with \nunleavened bread to signify the blameless life of the faithful who \npartake of Christ's body, according to 1 Cor. 5:8: \"Let us feast . . . \nwith the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\" The wild lettuces were \nadded to denote repentance for sins, which is required of those who \nreceive the body of Christ. Their loins were girt in sign of chastity: \nand the shoes of their feet are the examples of our dead ancestors. The \nstaves they were to hold in their hands denoted pastoral authority: and \nit was commanded that the paschal lamb should be eaten in one house, i.e. \nin a catholic church, and not in the conventicles of heretics.",
        "RP3": "Some of the sacraments of the New Law had corresponding \nfigurative sacraments in the Old Law. For Baptism, which is the sacrament \nof Faith, corresponds to circumcision. Hence it is written (Col. \n2:11,12): \"You are circumcised . . . in the circumcision of\" Our Lord \nJesus \"Christ: buried with Him in Baptism.\" In the New Law the sacrament \nof the Eucharist corresponds to the banquet of the paschal lamb. The \nsacrament of Penance in the New Law corresponds to all the purifications \nof the Old Law. The sacrament of Orders corresponds to the consecration \nof the pontiff and of the priests. To the sacrament of Confirmation, \nwhich is the sacrament of the fulness of grace, there would be no \ncorresponding sacrament of the Old Law, because the time of fulness had \nnot yet come, since \"the Law brought no man [Vulg.: 'nothing'] to \nperfection\" (Heb. 7:19). The same applies to the sacrament of Extreme \nUnction, which is an immediate preparation for entrance into glory, to \nwhich the way was not yet opened out in the Old Law, since the price had \nnot yet been paid. Matrimony did indeed exist under the Old Law, as a \nfunction of nature, but not as the sacrament of the union of Christ with \nthe Church, for that union was not as yet brought about. Hence under the \nOld Law it was allowable to give a bill of divorce, which is contrary to \nthe nature of the sacrament.",
        "RP4": "As already stated, the purifications of the Old Law were \nordained for the removal of impediments to the divine worship: which \nworship is twofold; viz. spiritual, consisting in devotion of the mind to \nGod; and corporal, consisting in sacrifices, oblations, and so forth. Now \nmen are hindered in the spiritual worship by sins, whereby men were said \nto be polluted, for instance, by idolatry, murder, adultery, or incest. \nFrom such pollutions men were purified by certain sacrifices, offered \neither for the whole community in general, or also for the sins of \nindividuals; not that those carnal sacrifices had of themselves the power \nof expiating sin; but that they signified that expiation of sins which \nwas to be effected by Christ, and of which those of old became partakers \nby protesting their faith in the Redeemer, while taking part in the \nfigurative sacrifices.\nThe impediments to external worship consisted in certain bodily \nuncleannesses; which were considered in the first place as existing in \nman, and consequently in other animals also, and in  man's clothes, \ndwelling-place, and vessels. In man himself uncleanness was considered as \narising partly from himself and partly from contact with unclean things. \nAnything proceeding from man was reputed unclean that was already subject \nto corruption, or exposed thereto: and consequently since death is a kind \nof corruption, the human corpse was considered unclean. In like manner, \nsince leprosy arises from corruption of the humors, which break out \nexternally and infect other persons, therefore were lepers also \nconsidered unclean; and, again, women suffering from a flow of blood, \nwhether from weakness, or from nature (either at the monthly course or at \nthe time of conception); and, for the same reason, men were reputed \nunclean if they suffered from a flow of seed, whether due to weakness, to \nnocturnal pollution, or to sexual intercourse. Because every humor \nissuing from man in the aforesaid ways involves some unclean infection. \nAgain, man contracted uncleanness by touching any unclean thing whatever.\nNow there was both a literal and a figurative reason for these \nuncleannesses. The literal reason was taken from the reverence due to \nthose things that belong to the divine worship: both because men are not \nwont, when unclean, to touch precious things: and in order that by rarely \napproaching sacred things they might have greater respect for them. For \nsince man could seldom avoid all the aforesaid uncleannesses, the result \nwas that men could seldom approach to touch things belonging to the \nworship of God, so that when they did approach, they did so with greater \nreverence and humility. Moreover, in some of these the literal reason was \nthat men should not be kept away from worshipping God through fear of \ncoming in contact with lepers and others similarly afflicted with \nloathsome and contagious diseases. In others, again, the reason was to \navoid idolatrous worship: because in their sacrificial rites the Gentiles \nsometimes employed human blood and seed. All these bodily uncleannesses \nwere purified either by the mere sprinkling of water, or, in the case of \nthose which were more grievous, by some sacrifice of expiation for the \nsin which was the occasion of the uncleanness in question.\nThe figurative reason for these uncleannesses was that they were figures \nof various sins. For the uncleanness of any corpse signifies the \nuncleanness of sin, which is the death of the soul. The uncleanness of \nleprosy betokened the uncleanness of heretical doctrine: both because \nheretical doctrine is contagious just as leprosy is, and because no \ndoctrine is so false as not to have some truth mingled with error, just \nas on the surface of a leprous body one may distinguish the healthy parts \nfrom those that are infected. The uncleanness of a woman suffering from a \nflow of blood denotes the uncleanness of idolatry, on account of the \nblood which is offered up. The uncleanness of the man who has suffered \nseminal loss signifies the uncleanness of empty words, for \"the seed is \nthe word of God.\" The uncleanness of sexual intercourse and of the woman \nin child-birth signifies the uncleanness of original sin. The uncleanness \nof the woman in her periods signifies the uncleanness of a mind that is \nsensualized by pleasure. Speaking generally, the uncleanness contracted \nby touching an unclean thing denotes the  uncleanness arising from \nconsent in another's sin, according to 2 Cor. 6:17: \"Go out from among \nthem, and be ye separate . . . and touch not the unclean thing.\"\nMoreover, this uncleanness arising from the touch was contracted even by \ninanimate objects; for whatever was touched in any way by an unclean man, \nbecame itself unclean. Wherein the Law attenuated the superstition of the \nGentiles, who held that uncleanness was contracted not only by touch, but \nalso by speech or looks, as Rabbi Moses states (Doct. Perplex. iii) of a \nwoman in her periods. The mystical sense of this was that \"to God the \nwicked and his wickedness are hateful alike\" (Wis. 14:9).\nThere was also an uncleanness of inanimate things considered in \nthemselves, such as the uncleanness of leprosy in a house or in clothes. \nFor just as leprosy occurs in men through a corrupt humor causing \nputrefaction and corruption in the flesh; so, too, through some \ncorruption and excess of humidity or dryness, there arises sometimes a \nkind of corruption in the stones with which a house is built, or in \nclothes. Hence the Law called this corruption by the name of leprosy, \nwhereby a house or a garment was deemed to be unclean: both because all \ncorruption savored of uncleanness, as stated above, and because the \nGentiles worshipped their household gods as a preservative against this \ncorruption. Hence the Law prescribed such houses, where this kind of \ncorruption was of a lasting nature, to be destroyed; and such garments to \nbe burnt, in order to avoid all occasion of idolatry. There was also an \nuncleanness of vessels, of which it is written (Num. 19:15): \"The vessel \nthat hath no cover, and binding over it, shall be unclean.\" The cause of \nthis uncleanness was that anything unclean might easily drop into such \nvessels, so as to render them unclean. Moreover, this command aimed at \nthe prevention of idolatry. For idolaters believed that if mice, lizards, \nor the like, which they used to sacrifice to the idols, fell into the \nvessels or into the water, these became more pleasing to the gods. Even \nnow some women let down uncovered vessels in honor of the nocturnal \ndeities which they call \"Janae.\"\nThe figurative reason of these uncleannesses is that the leprosy of a \nhouse signified the uncleanness of the assembly of heretics; the leprosy \nof a linen garment signified an evil life arising from bitterness of \nmind; the leprosy of a woolen garment denoted the wickedness of \nflatterers; leprosy in the warp signified the vices of the soul; leprosy \non the woof denoted sins of the flesh, for as the warp is in the woof, so \nis the soul in the body. The vessel that has neither cover nor binding, \nbetokens a man who lacks the veil of taciturnity, and who is unrestrained \nby any severity of discipline."

        "question": "Whether there was any reasonable cause for the ceremonial observances?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that there was no reasonable cause for the \nceremonial observances. Because, as the Apostle says (1 Tim. 4:4), \"every \ncreature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with \nthanksgiving.\" It was therefore unfitting that they should be forbidden \nto eat certain foods, as being unclean according to Lev. 11 [*Cf. Dt. 14].\n: Further, it is apparent that inanimate things are most of all \nsubject to the power of man. Therefore it was unfitting to  debar man \nfrom taking silver and gold of which idols were made, or anything they \nfound in the houses of idols, as expressed in the commandment of the Law \n(Dt. 7:25, seqq.). It also seems an absurd commandment set forth in Dt. \n23:13, that they should \"dig round about and . . . cover with earth that \nwhich they were eased of.\"\n: Further, piety is required especially in priests. But it seems \nto be an act of piety to assist at the burial of one's friends: wherefore \nTobias is commended for so doing (Tob. 1:20, seqq.). In like manner it is \nsometimes an act of piety to marry a loose woman, because she is thereby \ndelivered from sin and infamy. Therefore it seems inconsistent for these \nthings to be forbidden to priests (Lev. 21).",
        "OB2": "Further, just as animals are given to man for food, so also are \nherbs: wherefore it is written (Gn. 9:3): \"As the green herbs have I \ndelivered all\" flesh \"to you.\" But the Law did not distinguish any herbs \nfrom the rest as being unclean, although some are most harmful, for \ninstance, those that are poisonous. Therefore it seems that neither \nshould any animals have been prohibited as being unclean.",
        "OB3": "Further, if the matter from which a thing is generated be \nunclean, it seems that likewise the thing generated therefrom is unclean. \nBut flesh is generated from blood. Since therefore all flesh was not \nprohibited as unclean, it seems that in like manner neither should blood \nhave been forbidden as unclean; nor the fat which is engendered from \nblood.",
        "OB4": "Further, Our Lord said (Mt. 10:28; cf. Lk. 12:4), that those \nshould not be feared \"that kill the body,\" since after death they \"have \nno more that they can do\": which would not be true if after death harm \nmight come to man through anything done with his body. Much less \ntherefore does it matter to an animal already dead how its flesh be \ncooked. Consequently there seems to be no reason in what is said, Ex. \n23:19: \"Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of its dam.\"",
        "OB5": "Further, all that is first brought forth of man and beast, as \nbeing most perfect, is commanded to be offered to the Lord (Ex. 13). \nTherefore it is an unfitting command that is set forth in Lev. 19:23: \n\"when you shall be come into the land, and shall have planted in it fruit \ntrees, you shall take away the uncircumcision [*'Praeputia,' which Douay \nversion renders 'first fruits'] of them,\" i.e. the first crops, and they \n\"shall be unclean to you, neither shall you eat of them.\"\nObjection 6: Further, clothing is something extraneous to man's body. \nTherefore certain kinds of garments should not have been forbidden to the \nJews: for instance (Lev. 19:19): \"Thou shalt not wear a garment that is \nwoven of two sorts\": and (Dt. 22:5): \"A woman shall not be clothed with \nman's apparel, neither shall a man use woman's apparel\": and further on \n(Dt. 22:11): \"Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woolen and \nlinen together.\"\nObjection 7: Further, to be mindful of God's commandments concerns not the \nbody but the heart. Therefore it is unsuitably prescribed (Dt. 6:8, seqq.) that they should \"bind\" the commandments of God \"as a sign\" on \ntheir hands; and that they should \"write them in the entry\"; and (Num. 15:38, seqq.) that they should \"make to themselves fringes in the corners \nof their garments, putting in them ribands of blue . . . they may \nremember . . . the commandments of the Lord.\"\nObjection 8: Further, the Apostle says (1 Cor. 9:9) that God does not \"take \ncare for oxen,\" and, therefore, neither of other irrational animals. \nTherefore without reason is it commanded (Dt. 22:6): \"If thou find, as \nthou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree . . . thou shalt not \ntake the dam with her young\"; and (Dt. 25:4): \"Thou shalt not muzzle the \nox that treadeth out thy corn\"; and (Lev. 19:19): \"Thou shalt not make \nthy cattle to gender with beasts of any other kind.\"\nObjection 9: Further, no distinction was made between clean and unclean \nplants. Much less therefore should any distinction have been made about \nthe cultivation of plants. Therefore it was unfittingly prescribed (Lev. \n19:19): \"Thou shalt not sow thy field with different seeds\"; and (Dt. 22:9, seqq.): \"Thou shalt sow thy vineyard with divers seeds\"; and: \"Thou \nshalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.\"\nReply to  The Gentiles offered their gods the first-fruits, which \nthey held to bring them good luck: or they burnt them for the purpose of \nsecrecy. Consequently (the Israelites) were commanded to look upon the \nfruits of the first three years as unclean: for in that country nearly \nall the trees bear fruit in three years' time; those trees, to wit, that \nare cultivated either from seed, or from a graft, or from a cutting: but \nit seldom happens that the fruit-stones or seeds encased in a pod are \nsown: since it would take a longer time for these to bear fruit: and the \nLaw considered what happened most frequently. The fruits, however, of the \nfourth year, as being the firstlings of clean fruits, were offered to \nGod: and from the fifth year onward they were eaten.\nThe figurative reason was that this foreshadowed the fact that after the \nthree states of the Law (the first lasting from Abraham to David, the \nsecond, until they were carried away to Babylon, the third until the time \nof Christ), the Fruit of the Law, i.e. Christ, was to be offered to God. \nOr again, that we must mistrust our first efforts, on account of their \nimperfection.\nReply to Objection 6: It is said of a man in Ecclus. 19:27, that \"the attire of \nthe body . . . \" shows \"what he is.\" Hence the Lord wished His people to \nbe distinguished from other nations, not only by the sign of the \ncircumcision, which was in the flesh, but also by a certain difference of \nattire. Wherefore they were forbidden to wear garments woven of woolen \nand linen together, and for a woman to be clothed with man's apparel, or \nvice versa, for two reasons. First, to avoid idolatrous worship. Because \nthe Gentiles, in their religious rites, used garments of this sort, made \nof various materials. Moreover in the worship of Mars, women put on men's \narmor; while, conversely, in the worship of Venus men donned women's \nattire. The second reason was to preserve them from lust: because the \nemployment of various materials in the making of garments signified \ninordinate union of sexes, while the use of male attire by a woman, or \nvice versa, has an incentive to evil desires, and offers an occasion of \nlust. The figurative reason is that the prohibition of wearing a garment \nwoven of woolen and linen signified that it was forbidden to unite the \nsimplicity of innocence, denoted by wool, with the duplicity of malice, \nbetokened by linen. It also signifies that woman is forbidden to presume \nto teach, or perform other duties of men: or that man should not adopt \nthe effeminate manners of a woman.\nReply to Objection 7: As Jerome says on Mt. 23:6, \"the Lord commanded them to \nmake violet-colored fringes in the four corners of their  garments, so \nthat the Israelites might be distinguished from other nations.\" Hence, in \nthis way, they professed to be Jews: and consequently the very sight of \nthis sign reminded them of their law.\nWhen we read: \"Thou shalt bind them on thy hand, and they shall be ever \nbefore thy eyes [Vulg.: 'they shall be and shall move between thy eyes'], \nthe Pharisees gave a false interpretation to these words, and wrote the \ndecalogue of Moses on a parchment, and tied it on their foreheads like a \nwreath, so that it moved in front of their eyes\": whereas the intention \nof the Lord in giving this commandment was that they should be bound in \ntheir hands, i.e. in their works; and that they should be before their \neyes, i.e. in their thoughts. The violet-colored fillets which were \ninserted in their cloaks signify the godly intention which should \naccompany our every deed. It may, however, be said that, because they \nwere a carnal-minded and stiff-necked people, it was necessary for them \nto be stirred by these sensible things to the observance of the Law.\nReply to Objection 8: Affection in man is twofold: it may be an affection of \nreason, or it may be an affection of passion. If a man's affection be one \nof reason, it matters not how man behaves to animals, because God has \nsubjected all things to man's power, according to Ps. 8:8: \"Thou hast \nsubjected all things under his feet\": and it is in this sense that the \nApostle says that \"God has no care for oxen\"; because God does not ask of \nman what he does with oxen or other animals.\nBut if man's affection be one of passion, then it is moved also in \nregard to other animals: for since the passion of pity is caused by the \nafflictions of others; and since it happens that even irrational animals \nare sensible to pain, it is possible for the affection of pity to arise \nin a man with regard to the sufferings of animals. Now it is evident that \nif a man practice a pitiful affection for animals, he is all the more \ndisposed to take pity on his fellow-men: wherefore it is written (Prov. 11:10): \"The just regardeth the lives of his beasts: but the bowels of \nthe wicked are cruel.\" Consequently the Lord, in order to inculcate pity \nto the Jewish people, who were prone to cruelty, wished them to practice \npity even with regard to dumb animals, and forbade them to do certain \nthings savoring of cruelty to animals. Hence He prohibited them to \"boil \na kid in the milk of its dam\"; and to \"muzzle the ox that treadeth out \nthe corn\"; and to slay \"the dam with her young.\" It may, nevertheless, be \nalso said that these prohibitions were made in hatred of idolatry. For \nthe Egyptians held it to be wicked to allow the ox to eat of the grain \nwhile threshing the corn. Moreover certain sorcerers were wont to ensnare \nthe mother bird with her young during incubation, and to employ them for \nthe purpose of securing fruitfulness and good luck in bringing up \nchildren: also because it was held to be a good omen to find the mother \nsitting on her young.\nAs to the mingling of animals of divers species, the literal reason may \nhave been threefold. The first was to show detestation  for the idolatry \nof the Egyptians, who employed various mixtures in worshipping the \nplanets, which produce various effects, and on various kinds of things \naccording to their various conjunctions. The second reason was in \ncondemnation of unnatural sins. The third reason was the entire removal \nof all occasions of concupiscence. Because animals of different species \ndo not easily breed, unless this be brought about by man; and movements \nof lust are aroused by seeing such things. Wherefore in the Jewish \ntraditions we find it prescribed as stated by Rabbi Moses that men shall \nturn away their eyes from such sights.\nThe figurative reason for these things is that the necessities of life \nshould not be withdrawn from the ox that treadeth the corn, i.e. from the \npreacher bearing the sheaves of doctrine, as the Apostle states (1 Cor. 9:4, seqq.). Again, we should not take the dam with her young: because in \ncertain things we have to keep the spiritual senses, i.e. the offspring, \nand set aside the observance of the letter, i.e. the mother, for \ninstance, in all the ceremonies of the Law. It is also forbidden that \nbeast of burden, i.e. any of the common people, should be allowed to \nengender, i.e. to have any connection, with animals of another kind, i.e. \nwith Gentiles or Jews.\nReply to Objection 9: All these minglings were forbidden in agriculture; \nliterally, in detestation of idolatry. For the Egyptians in worshipping \nthe stars employed various combinations of seeds, animals and garments, \nin order to represent the various connections of the stars. Or else all \nthese minglings were forbidden in detestation of the unnatural vice.\nThey have, however, a figurative reason. For the prohibition: \"Thou \nshalt not sow thy field with different seeds,\" is to be understood, in \nthe spiritual sense, of the prohibition to sow strange doctrine in the \nChurch, which is a spiritual vineyard. Likewise \"the field,\" i.e. the \nChurch, must not be sown \"with different seeds,\" i.e. with Catholic and \nheretical doctrines. Neither is it allowed to plough \"with an ox and an \nass together\"; thus a fool should not accompany a wise man in preaching, \nfor one would hinder the other.",
        "CON": "It is written (Dt. 18:14): \"But thou art otherwise \ninstructed by the Lord thy God\": from which words we may gather that \nthese observances were instituted by God to be a special prerogative of \nthat people. Therefore they are not without reason or cause.",
        "ANS": "The Jewish people, as stated above (Article [5]), were specially \nchosen for the worship of God, and among them the priests themselves were \nspecially set apart for that purpose. And just as other things that are \napplied to the divine worship, need to be marked in some particular way \nso that they be worthy of the worship of God; so too in that people's, \nand especially the priests', mode of life, there needed to be certain \nspecial things befitting the divine worship, whether spiritual or \ncorporal. Now the worship prescribed by the Law foreshadowed the mystery \nof Christ: so that whatever they did was a figure of things pertaining to \nChrist, according to 1 Cor. 10:11: \"All these things happened to them in \nfigures.\" Consequently the reasons for these observances may be taken in \ntwo ways, first according to their fittingness to the worship of God; \nsecondly, according as they foreshadow something touching the Christian \nmode of life.",
        "RP1": "As stated above (Article [5], ad 4,5), the Law distinguished a \ntwofold pollution or uncleanness; one, that of sin, whereby the soul was \ndefiled; and another consisting in some kind of corruption, whereby the \nbody was in some way infected. Speaking then of the first-mentioned \nuncleanness, no kind of food is unclean, or can defile a man, by reason \nof its nature; wherefore we read (Mt. 15:11): \"Not that which goeth into \nthe mouth defileth a man; but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth \na man\": which words are explained (Mt. 15:17) as referring to sins. Yet \ncertain foods can defile the soul accidentally; in so far as man partakes \nof them against obedience or a vow, or from excessive concupiscence; or \nthrough their being an incentive to lust, for which reason some refrain \nfrom wine and flesh-meat.\nIf, however, we speak of bodily uncleanness, consisting in some kind of \ncorruption, the flesh of certain animals is unclean, either because like \nthe pig they feed on unclean things; or because their life is among \nunclean surroundings: thus certain animals,  like moles and mice and such \nlike, live underground, whence they contract a certain unpleasant smell; \nor because their flesh, through being too moist or too dry, engenders \ncorrupt humors in the human body. Hence they were forbidden to eat the \nflesh of flat-footed animals, i.e. animals having an uncloven hoof, on \naccount of their earthiness; and in like manner they were forbidden to \neat the flesh of animals that have many clefts in their feet, because \nsuch are very fierce and their flesh is very dry, such as the flesh of \nlions and the like. For the same reason they were forbidden to eat \ncertain birds of prey the flesh of which is very dry, and certain \nwater-fowl on account of their exceeding humidity. In like manner certain \nfish lacking fins and scales were prohibited on account of their \nexcessive moisture; such as eels and the like. They were, however, \nallowed to eat ruminants and animals with a divided hoof, because in such \nanimals the humors are well absorbed, and their nature well balanced: for \nneither are they too moist, as is indicated by the hoof; nor are they too \nearthly, which is shown by their having not a flat but a cloven hoof. Of \nfishes they were allowed to partake of the drier kinds, of which the fins \nand scales are an indication, because thereby the moist nature of the \nfish is tempered. Of birds they were allowed to eat the tamer kinds, such \nas hens, partridges, and the like. Another reason was detestation of \nidolatry: because the Gentiles, and especially the Egyptians, among whom \nthey had grown up, offered up these forbidden animals to their idols, or \nemployed them for the purpose of sorcery: whereas they did not eat those \nanimals which the Jews were allowed to eat, but worshipped them as gods, \nor abstained, for some other motive, from eating them, as stated above \n(Article [3], ad 2). The third reason was to prevent excessive care about food: \nwherefore they were allowed to eat those animals which could be procured \neasily and promptly.\nWith regard to blood and fat, they were forbidden to partake of those of \nany animals whatever without exception. Blood was forbidden, both in \norder to avoid cruelty, that they might abhor the shedding of human \nblood, as stated above (Article [3], ad 8); and in order to shun idolatrous rite \nwhereby it was customary for men to collect the blood and to gather \ntogether around it for a banquet in honor of the idols, to whom they held \nthe blood to be most acceptable. Hence the Lord commanded the blood to be \npoured out and to be covered with earth (Lev. 17:13). For the same reason \nthey were forbidden to eat animals that had been suffocated or strangled: \nbecause the blood of these animals would not be separated from the body: \nor because this form of death is very painful to the victim; and the Lord \nwished to withdraw them from cruelty even in regard to irrational \nanimals, so as to be less inclined to be cruel to other men, through \nbeing used to be kind to beasts. They were forbidden to eat the fat: both \nbecause idolaters ate it in honor of their gods; and because it used to \nbe burnt in honor of God; and, again, because blood and fat are not \nnutritious, which is the cause assigned by Rabbi Moses (Doct. Perplex. \niii). The reason why they were forbidden to eat the sinews is given in \nGn. 32:32, where it is stated that \"the children of Israel . . . eat not \nthe sinew . . . because he touched the sinew of\" Jacob's \"thing and it \nshrank.\"\nThe figurative reason for these things is that all these animals \nsignified certain sins, in token of which those animals were prohibited. \nHence Augustine says (Contra Faustum iv, 7): \"If the swine and lamb be \ncalled in question, both are clean by nature, because all God's creatures \nare good: yet the lamb is clean, and the pig is unclean in a certain \nsignification. Thus if you speak of a foolish, and of a wise man, each of \nthese expressions is clean considered in the nature of the sound, letters \nand syllables of which it is composed: but in signification, the one is \nclean, the other unclean.\" The animal that chews the cud and has a \ndivided hoof, is clean in signification. Because division of the hoof is \na figure of the two Testaments: or of the Father and Son: or of the two \nnatures in Christ: of the distinction of good and evil. While chewing the \ncud signifies meditation on the Scriptures and a sound understanding \nthereof; and whoever lacks either of these is spiritually unclean. In \nlike manner those fish that have scales and fins are clean in \nsignification. Because fins signify the heavenly or contemplative life; \nwhile scales signify a life of trials, each of which is required for \nspiritual cleanness. Of birds certain kinds were forbidden. In the eagle \nwhich flies at a great height, pride is forbidden: in the griffon which \nis hostile to horses and men, cruelty of powerful men is prohibited. The \nosprey, which feeds on very small birds, signifies those who oppress the \npoor. The kite, which is full of cunning, denotes those who are \nfraudulent in their dealings. The vulture, which follows an army, \nexpecting to feed on the carcases of the slain, signifies those who like \nothers to die or to fight among themselves that they may gain thereby. \nBirds of the raven kind signify those who are blackened by their lusts; \nor those who lack kindly feelings, for the raven did not return when once \nit had been let loose from the ark. The ostrich which, though a bird, \ncannot fly, and is always on the ground, signifies those who fight God's \ncause, and at the same time are taken up with worldly business. The owl, \nwhich sees clearly at night, but cannot see in the daytime, denotes those \nwho are clever in temporal affairs, but dull in spiritual matters. The \ngull, which flies both in the air and swims in the water, signifies those \nwho are partial both to Circumcision and to Baptism: or else it denotes \nthose who would fly by contemplation, yet dwell in the waters of sensual \ndelights. The hawk, which helps men to seize the prey, is a figure of \nthose who assist the strong to prey on the poor. The screech-owl, which \nseeks its food by night but hides by day, signifies the lustful man who \nseeks to lie hidden in his deeds of darkness. The cormorant, so \nconstituted that it can stay a long time under water, denotes the glutton \nwho plunges into the waters of pleasure. The ibis is an African bird with \na long beak, and feeds on snakes; and perhaps it is the same as the \nstork: it signifies the envious man, who refreshes himself with the ills \nof others, as with snakes. The swan is bright in color, and by the aid of \nits long neck extracts its food from deep places on land or water: it may \ndenote those who seek earthly profit though an external brightness of \nvirtue. The bittern is a bird of the East: it has a long beak, and its \njaws are furnished with follicules, wherein it stores its food at first, \nafter a time proceeding to  digest it: it is a figure of the miser, who \nis excessively careful in hoarding up the necessaries of life. The coot \n[*Douay: 'porphyrion.' St. Thomas' description tallies with the coot or \nmoorhen: though of course he is mistaken about the feet differing from \none another.] has this peculiarity apart from other birds, that it has a \nwebbed foot for swimming, and a cloven foot for walking: for it swims \nlike a duck in the water, and walks like a partridge on land: it drinks \nonly when it bites, since it dips all its food in water: it is a figure \nof a man who will not take advice, and does nothing but what is soaked in \nthe water of his own will. The heron [*Vulg.: 'herodionem'], commonly \ncalled a falcon, signifies those whose \"feet are swift to shed blood\" \n(Ps. 13:3). The plover [*Here, again, the Douay translators transcribed \nfrom the Vulgate: 'charadrion'; 'charadrius' is the generic name for all \nplovers.], which is a garrulous bird, signifies the gossip. The hoopoe, \nwhich builds its nest on dung, feeds on foetid ordure, and whose song is \nlike a groan, denotes worldly grief which works death in those who are \nunclean. The bat, which flies near the ground, signifies those who being \ngifted with worldly knowledge, seek none but earthly things. Of fowls and \nquadrupeds those alone were permitted which have the hind-legs longer \nthan the forelegs, so that they can leap: whereas those were forbidden \nwhich cling rather to the earth: because those who abuse the doctrine of \nthe four Evangelists, so that they are not lifted up thereby, are reputed \nunclean. By the prohibition of blood, fat and nerves, we are to \nunderstand the forbidding of cruelty, lust, and bravery in committing sin.\n: [*The Reply to the Tenth Objection is lacking in the \ncodices. The solution given here is found in some editions, and was \nsupplied by Nicolai.] Silver and gold were reasonably forbidden (Dt. 7) \nnot as though they were not subject to the power of man, but because, \nlike the idols themselves, all materials out of which idols were made, \nwere anathematized as hateful in God's sight. This is clear from the same \nchapter, where we read further on (Dt. 7:26): \"Neither shalt thou bring \nanything of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema like \nit.\" Another reason was lest, by taking silver and gold, they should be \nled by avarice into idolatry to which the Jews were inclined. The other \nprecept (Dt. 23) about covering up excretions, was just and becoming, \nboth for the sake of bodily cleanliness; and in order to keep the air \nwholesome; and by reason of the respect due to the tabernacle of  the \ncovenant which stood in the midst of the camp, wherein the Lord was said \nto dwell; as is clearly set forth in the same passage, where after \nexpressing the command, the reason thereof is at once added, to wit: \"For \nthe Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and \nto give up thy enemies to thee, and let thy camp be holy [i.e. clean], \nand let no uncleanness appear therein.\" The figurative reason for this \nprecept, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi), is that sins which are the \nfetid excretions of the mind should be covered over by repentance, that \nwe may become acceptable to God, according to Ps. 31:1: \"Blessed are they \nwhose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\" Or else \naccording to a gloss, that we should recognize the unhappy condition of \nhuman nature, and humbly cover and purify the stains of a puffed-up and \nproud spirit in the deep furrow of self-examination.\n: Sorcerers and idolatrous priests made use, in their rites, \nof the bones and flesh of dead men. Wherefore, in order to extirpate the \ncustoms of idolatrous worship, the Lord commanded that the priests of \ninferior degree, who at fixed times served in the temple, should not \n\"incur an uncleanness at the death\" of anyone except of those who were \nclosely related to them, viz. their father or mother, and others thus \nnear of kin to them. But the high-priest had always to be ready for the \nservice of the sanctuary; wherefore he was absolutely forbidden to \napproach the dead, however nearly related to him. They were also \nforbidden to marry a \"harlot\" or \"one that has been put away,\" or any \nother than a virgin: both on account of the reverence due to the \npriesthood, the honor of which would seem to be tarnished by such a \nmarriage: and for the sake of the children who would be disgraced by the \nmother's shame: which was most of all to be avoided when the priestly \ndignity was passed on from father to son. Again, they were commanded to \nshave neither head nor beard, and not to make incisions in their flesh, \nin order to exclude the rites of idolatry. For the priests of the \nGentiles shaved both head and beard, wherefore it is written (Bar 6:30): \n\"Priests sit in their temples having their garments rent, and their heads \nand beards shaven.\" Moreover, in worshipping their idols \"they cut \nthemselves with knives and lancets\" (3 Kgs. 18:28). For this reason the \npriests of the Old Law were commanded to do the contrary.\nThe spiritual reason for these things is that priests should be entirely \nfree from dead works, i.e. sins. And they should not shave their heads, \ni.e. set wisdom aside; nor should they shave their beards, i.e. set aside \nthe perfection of wisdom; nor rend their garments or cut their flesh, \ni.e. they should not incur the sin of schism.",

For the soil gives birth to the herb of its own \naccord; and such like products of the earth may be had in great \nquantities with very little effort: whereas no small trouble is necessary \neither to rear or to catch an animal. Consequently God being wishful to \nbring His people back to a more simple way of living, forbade them to eat \nmany kinds of animals, but not those things that are produced by the \nsoil.

        "ANS": "As stated above (Question [102], Article [5], ad 4), a twofold \nuncleanness was distinguished in the Old Law. One was spiritual and is \nthe uncleanness of sin. The other was corporal, which rendered a man \nunfit for divine worship; thus a leper, or anyone that touched carrion, \nwas said to be unclean: and thus uncleanness was nothing but a kind of \nirregularity. From this uncleanness, then, the ceremonies of the Old Law \nhad the power to cleanse: because they were ordered by the Law to be \nemployed as remedies for the removal of the aforesaid uncleannesses which \nwere contracted in consequence of the prescription of the Law. Hence the \nApostle says (Heb. 9:13) that \"the blood of goats and of oxen, and the \nashes of a heifer, being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the \ncleansing of the flesh.\" And just as this uncleanness which was washed \naway by such like ceremonies, affected the flesh rather than the soul, so \nalso the ceremonies themselves are called by the Apostle shortly before \n(Heb. 9:10) justices of the flesh: \"justices of the flesh,\" says he, \n\"being laid on them until the time of correction.\"\nOn the other hand, they had no power of cleansing from uncleanness of \nthe soul, i.e. from the uncleanness of sin. The reason of this was that \nat no time could there be expiation from sin, except through Christ, \"Who \ntaketh away the sins [Vulg.:  'sin'] of the world\" (Jn. 1:29). And since \nthe mystery of Christ's Incarnation and Passion had not yet really taken \nplace, those ceremonies of the Old Law could not really contain in \nthemselves a power flowing from Christ already incarnate and crucified, \nsuch as the sacraments of the New Law contain. Consequently they could \nnot cleanse from sin: thus the Apostle says (Heb. 10:4) that \"it is \nimpossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken \naway\"; and for this reason he calls them (Gal. 4:9) \"weak and needy \nelements\": weak indeed, because they cannot take away sin; but this \nweakness results from their being needy, i.e. from the fact that they do \nnot contain grace within themselves.\nHowever, it was possible at the time of the Law, for the minds of the \nfaithful, to be united by faith to Christ incarnate and crucified; so \nthat they were justified by faith in Christ: of which faith the \nobservance of these ceremonies was a sort of profession, inasmuch as they \nforeshadowed Christ. Hence in the Old Law certain sacrifices were offered \nup for sins, not as though the sacrifices themselves washed sins away, \nbut because they were professions of faith which cleansed from sin. In \nfact, the Law itself implies this in the terms employed: for it is \nwritten (Lev. 4:26; 5:16) that in offering the sacrifice for sin \"the \npriest shall pray for him . . . and it shall be forgiven him,\" as though \nthe sin were forgiven, not in virtue of the sacrifices, but through the \nfaith and devotion of those who offered them. It must be observed, \nhowever, that the very fact that the ceremonies of the Old Law washed \naway uncleanness of the body, was a figure of that expiation from sins \nwhich was effected by Christ.\nIt is therefore evident that under the state of the Old Law the \nceremonies had no power of justification.",

Now man can make profession of his \ninward faith, by deeds as well as by words: and in either profession, if \nhe make a false declaration, he sins mortally. Now, though our faith in \nChrist is the same as that of the fathers of old; yet, since they came \nbefore Christ, whereas we come after Him, the same faith is expressed in \ndifferent words, by us and by them. For by them was it said: \"Behold a \nvirgin shall conceive and bear a son,\" where the verbs are in the future \ntense: whereas we express the same by means of verbs in the past tense, \nand say that she \"conceived and bore.\" In like manner the ceremonies of \nthe Old Law betokened Christ as having yet to be born and to suffer: \nwhereas our sacraments signify Him as already born and having suffered. \nConsequently, just as it would be a mortal sin now for anyone, in making \na profession of faith, to say that Christ is yet to be born, which the \nfathers of old said devoutly and truthfully; so too it would be a mortal \nsin now to observe those ceremonies which the fathers of old fulfilled \nwith devotion and fidelity. Such is the teaching Augustine (Contra Faust. \nxix, 16), who says: \"It is no longer promised that He shall be born, \nshall suffer and rise again, truths of which their sacraments were a kind \nof image: but it is declared that He is already born, has suffered and \nrisen again; of which our sacraments, in which Christians share, are the \nactual representation.\"",
        "RP1": "On this point there seems to have been a difference of \nopinion between Jerome and Augustine. For Jerome (Super Galat. ii, 11, \nseqq.) distinguished two periods of time. One was the time previous to \nChrist's Passion, during which the legal ceremonies were neither dead, \nsince they were obligatory, and did expiate in their own fashion; nor \ndeadly, because it was not sinful to observe them. But immediately after \nChrist's Passion they began to be not only dead, so as no longer to be \neither effectual or binding; but also deadly, so that whoever observed \nthem was guilty of mortal sin. Hence he maintained that after the Passion \nthe apostles never observed the legal ceremonies in real earnest; but \nonly by a kind of pious pretense, lest, to wit, they should scandalize \nthe Jews and hinder their conversion. This pretense, however, is to be \nunderstood, not as though they did not in reality perform those actions, \nbut in the sense that they performed them without the mind to observe the \nceremonies of the Law: thus a man might cut away his foreskin for \nhealth's sake, not with the intention of observing legal circumcision.\nBut since it seems unbecoming that the apostles, in order to avoid \nscandal, should have hidden things pertaining to the truth of life and \ndoctrine, and that they should have made use of pretense, in things \npertaining to the salvation of the faithful; therefore Augustine (Epist. \nlxxxii) more fittingly distinguished three periods of time. One was the \ntime that preceded the Passion of Christ, during which the legal \nceremonies were neither deadly nor dead: another period was after the \npublication of the Gospel, during which the legal ceremonies are both \ndead and deadly. The third is a middle period, viz. from the Passion of \nChrist until the publication of the Gospel, during which the legal \nceremonies were dead indeed, because they had neither effect nor binding \nforce; but were not deadly, because it was lawful for the Jewish converts \nto Christianity to observe them, provided they did not put their trust in \nthem so as to hold them to be necessary unto salvation, as though faith \nin Christ could not justify without the legal observances. On the other \nhand, there was no reason why those who were converted from heathendom to \nChristianity should observe them. Hence Paul circumcised Timothy, who was \nborn of a Jewish mother; but was unwilling to circumcise Titus, who was \nof heathen nationality.\nThe reason why the Holy Ghost did not wish the converted Jews to be \ndebarred at once from observing the legal ceremonies, while converted \nheathens were forbidden to observe the rites of heathendom, was in order \nto show that there is a difference between these rites. For heathenish \nceremonial was rejected as absolutely unlawful, and as prohibited by God \nfor all time; whereas the legal ceremonial ceased as being fulfilled \nthrough Christ's Passion, being instituted by God as a figure of Christ.",
        "RP2": "According to Jerome, Peter withdrew himself from the \nGentiles by pretense, in order to avoid giving scandal to the Jews, of \nwhom he was the Apostle. Hence he did not sin at all in acting thus. On \nthe other hand, Paul in like manner made a pretense of blaming him, in \norder to avoid scandalizing the Gentiles, whose Apostle he was. But \nAugustine disapproves of this solution: because in the canonical \nScripture (viz. Gal. 2:11), wherein we must not hold anything to be \nfalse, Paul says that Peter \"was to be blamed.\" Consequently it is true \nthat Peter was at fault: and Paul blamed him in very truth and not with \npretense. Peter, however, did not sin, by observing the legal ceremonial \nfor the time being; because this was lawful for him who was a converted \nJew. But he did sin by excessive minuteness in the observance of the \nlegal rites lest he should scandalize the Jews, the result being that he \ngave scandal to the Gentiles.",

Since, however, murder \nand rapine were held to be unlawful even by the Gentiles, there would \nhave been no need to give this special commandment to those who were \nconverted to Christ from heathendom. Hence others maintain that those \nfoods were forbidden literally, not to prevent the observance of legal \nceremonies, but in order to prevent gluttony. Thus Jerome says on Ezech. \n44:31 (\"The priest shall not eat of anything that is dead\"): \"He condemns \nthose priests who from gluttony did not keep these precepts.\"\nBut since certain foods are more delicate than these and more conducive \nto gluttony, there seems no reason why these should have been forbidden \nmore than the others.\nWe must therefore follow the third opinion, and hold that these foods \nwere forbidden literally, not with the purpose of enforcing compliance \nwith the legal ceremonies, but in order to further the union of Gentiles \nand Jews living side by side. Because blood and things strangled were \nloathsome to the Jews by ancient custom; while the Jews might have \nsuspected the Gentiles of relapse into idolatry if the latter had \npartaken of things offered to idols. Hence these things were prohibited \nfor the time being, during which the Gentiles and Jews were to become \nunited together. But as time went on, with the lapse of the cause, the \neffect lapsed also, when the truth of the Gospel teaching was divulged, \nwherein Our Lord taught that \"not that which entereth into the mouth \ndefileth a man\" (Mt. 15:11); and that \"nothing is to be rejected that is \nreceived with thanksgiving\" (1 Tim. 4:4). With regard to fornication a \nspecial prohibition was made, because the Gentiles did not hold it to be \nsinful."

These are called \"moral\" \nprecepts: since human morals are based on reason. At the same time there \nare other precepts which derive their binding force, not from the very \ndictate of reason (because, considered in themselves, they do not imply \nan obligation of something due or undue); but from some institution, \nDivine or human: and such are certain determinations of the moral \nprecepts. When therefore the moral precepts are fixed by Divine \ninstitution in matters relating to man's subordination to God, they are \ncalled \"ceremonial\" precepts: but when they refer to man's relations to \nother men, they are called \"judicial\" precepts. Hence there are two \nconditions attached to the judicial precepts: viz. first, that they refer \nto man's relations to other men; secondly, that they derive their binding \nforce not from reason alone, but in virtue of their institution.",

Now God is concerned not only with the \nsacrifices that are offered to Him, but also with whatever relates to the \nfitness of those who offer sacrifices to Him and worship Him. Because men \nare ordained to God as to their end; wherefore it concerns God and, \nconsequently, is a matter of ceremonial precept, that man should show \nsome fitness for the divine worship. On the other hand, man is not \nordained to his neighbor as to his end, so as to need to be disposed in \nhimself with regard to his neighbor, for such is the relationship of a \nslave to his master, since a slave \"is his master's in all that he is,\" \nas the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2). Hence there are no judicial \nprecepts ordaining man in himself; all such precepts are moral: because \nthe reason, which is the principal in moral matters, holds the same \nposition, in man, with regard to things that concern him, as a prince or \njudge holds in the state. Nevertheless we must take note that, since the \nrelations of man to his neighbor are more subject to reason than the \nrelations of man to God, there are more precepts whereby man is directed \nin his relations to his neighbor, than whereby he is directed to God.

The other point is to be observed in respect of \nthe kinds of government, or the different ways in which the constitutions \nare established. For whereas these differ in kind, as the Philosopher \nstates (Polit. iii, 5), nevertheless the first place is held by the \n\"kingdom,\" where the power of government is vested in one; and \n\"aristocracy,\" which signifies government by the best, where the power of \ngovernment is vested in a few. Accordingly, the best form of government \nis in a state or kingdom, where one is given the power to preside over \nall; while under him are others having governing powers: and yet a \ngovernment of this kind is shared by all, both because all are eligible \nto govern, and because the rules are chosen by all. For this is the best \nform of polity, being partly kingdom, since there is one at the head of \nall; partly aristocracy, in so far as a number of persons are set in \nauthority; partly democracy, i.e. government by the people, in so far as \nthe rulers can be chosen from the people, and the people have the right \nto choose their rulers.\nSuch was the form of government established by the Divine Law. For Moses \nand his successors governed the people in such a way that each of them \nwas ruler over all; so that there was a kind of kingdom. Moreover, \nseventy-two men were chosen, who were elders in virtue: for it is written \n(Dt. 1:15): \"I took out of your tribes wise and honorable, and appointed \nthem rulers\": so that there was an element of aristocracy. But it was a \ndemocratical government in so far as the rulers were chosen from all the \npeople; for it is written (Ex. 18:21): \"Provide out of all the people \nwise [Vulg.: 'able'] men,\" etc.; and, again, in so far as they were \nchosen by the people; wherefore it is written (Dt. 1:13): \"Let me have \nfrom among you wise [Vulg.: 'able'] men,\" etc. Consequently it is evident \nthat the ordering of the rulers was well provided for by the Law.",

He also appointed the manner in which they were to conduct \nthemselves towards God: namely, that they should continually read and \nponder on God's Law, and should ever fear and obey God.

Therefore the Law is unreasonable in \npunishing them (Ex. 21:29): \"If the ox . . . shall kill a man or a \nwoman,\" it \"shall be stoned\": and (Lev. 20:16): \"The woman that shall lie \nunder any beast, shall be killed together with the same.\" Therefore it \nseems that matters pertaining to the relations of one man with another \nwere unsuitably regulated by the Law.\n: Further, the Lord commanded (Ex. 21:12) a murderer to be \npunished with death. But the death of a dumb animal is reckoned of much \nless account than the slaying of a man. Hence murder cannot be \nsufficiently punished by the slaying of a dumb animal. Therefore it is \nunfittingly prescribed (Dt. 21:1,4) that \"when there shall be found . . . \nthe corpse of a man slain, and it is not known who is guilty of the \nmurder . . . the ancients\" of the nearest city \"shall take a heifer of \nthe herd, that hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground, and \nthey shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that never was \nploughed, nor sown; and there they shall strike off the head of the \nheifer.\"",
        "OB2": "Further, one of the chief causes of the downfall of states has \nbeen the holding of property by women, as the Philosopher says (Polit. \nii, 6). But this was introduced by the Old Law; for it is written (Num. 27:8): \"When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his \ndaughter.\" Therefore the Law made unsuitable provision for the welfare of \nthe people.",
        "OB3": "Further, it is most conducive to the preservation of human \nsociety that men may provide themselves with necessaries by buying and \nselling, as stated in Polit. i. But the Old Law took away the force of \nsales; since it prescribes that in the 50th year of the jubilee all that \nis sold shall return to the vendor (Lev. 25:28). Therefore in this matter \nthe Law gave the people an unfitting command.",
        "OB4": "Further, man's needs require that men should be ready to lend: \nwhich readiness ceases if the creditors do not return the pledges: hence \nit is written (Ecclus. 29:10): \"Many have refused to lend, not out of \nwickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.\" And yet \nthis was encouraged by the Law. First, because it prescribed (Dt. 15:2): \n\"He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbor or brother, \ncannot demand it again, because it is the year of remission of the Lord\"; \nand (Ex. 22:15) it is stated that if a borrowed animal should die while \nthe owner is present, the borrower is not bound to make restitution. \nSecondly, because the security acquired through the pledge is lost: for \nit is written (Dt. 24:10): \"When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor any \nthing that he oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a \npledge\"; and again (Dt. 24:12,13): \"The pledge shall not lodge with thee \nthat night, but thou shalt restore it to  him presently.\" Therefore the \nLaw made insufficient provision in the matter of loans.",
        "OB5": "Further, considerable risk attaches to goods deposited with a \nfraudulent depositary: wherefore great caution should be observed in such \nmatters: hence it is stated in 2 Mach 3:15 that \"the priests . . . called \nupon Him from heaven, Who made the law concerning things given to be \nkept, that He would preserve them safe, for them that had deposited \nthem.\" But the precepts of the Old Law observed little caution in regard \nto deposits: since it is prescribed (Ex. 22:10,11) that when goods \ndeposited are lost, the owner is to stand by the oath of the depositary. \nTherefore the Law made unsuitable provision in this matter.\nObjection 6: Further, just as a workman offers his work for hire, so do men \nlet houses and so forth. But there is no need for the tenant to pay his \nrent as soon as he takes a house. Therefore it seems an unnecessarily \nhard prescription (Lev. 19:13) that \"the wages of him that hath been \nhired by thee shall not abide with thee until morning.\"\nObjection 7: Further, since there is often pressing need for a judge, it \nshould be easy to gain access to one. It was therefore unfitting that the \nLaw (Dt. 17:8,9) should command them to go to a fixed place to ask for \njudgment on doubtful matters.\nObjection 8: Further, it is possible that not only two, but three or more, \nshould agree to tell a lie. Therefore it is unreasonably stated (Dt. 19:15) that \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall \nstand.\"\nObjection 9: Further, punishment should be fixed according to the gravity of \nthe fault: for which reason also it is written (Dt. 25:2): \"According to \nthe measure of the sin, shall the measure also of the stripes be.\" Yet \nthe Law fixed unequal punishments for certain faults: for it is written \n(Ex. 22:1) that the thief \"shall restore five oxen for one ox, and four \nsheep for one sheep.\" Moreover, certain slight offenses are severely \npunished: thus (Num. 15:32, seqq.) a man is stoned for gathering sticks \non the sabbath day: and (Dt. 21:18, seqq.) the unruly son is commanded to \nbe stoned on account of certain small transgressions, viz. because \"he \ngave himself to revelling . . . and banquetings.\" Therefore the Law \nprescribed punishments in an unreasonable manner.\nReply to  The difference between a loan and a deposit is that a loan \nis in respect of goods transferred for the use of the person to whom they \nare transferred, whereas a deposit is for the benefit of the depositor. \nHence in certain cases there was a stricter obligation of returning a \nloan than of restoring goods held in deposit. Because the latter might be \nlost in two ways. First, unavoidably: i.e. either through a natural \ncause, for instance if an animal held in deposit were to die or \ndepreciate in value; or through an extrinsic cause, for instance, if it \nwere taken by an enemy, or devoured by a beast (in which case, however, a \nman was bound to restore to the owner what was left of the animal thus \nslain): whereas in the other cases mentioned above, he was not bound to \nmake restitution; but only to take an oath in order to clear himself of \nsuspicion. Secondly, the goods deposited might be lost through an \navoidable cause, for instance by theft: and then the depositary was bound \nto restitution on account of his neglect. But, as stated above (ad 4), he \nwho held an animal on loan, was bound to restitution, even if he were \nabsent when it depreciated or died: because he was held responsible for \nless negligence than a depositary, who was only held responsible in case \nof theft.\nReply to Objection 6: Workmen who offer their labor for hire, are poor men who \ntoil for their daily bread: and therefore the Law commanded wisely that \nthey should be paid at once, lest they should lack food. But they who \noffer other commodities for hire, are wont to be rich: nor are they in \nsuch need of their price in order to gain a livelihood: and consequently \nthe comparison does not hold.\nReply to Objection 7: The purpose for which judges are appointed among men, is \nthat they may decide doubtful points in matters of justice. Now a matter \nmay be doubtful in two ways. First, among simple-minded people: and in \norder to remove doubts of this kind, it was prescribed (Dt. 16:18) that \n\"judges and magistrates\" should be appointed in each tribe, \"to judge the \npeople with just judgment.\" Secondly, a matter may be doubtful even among \nexperts: and therefore, in order to remove doubts of this kind, the Law \nprescribed that all should foregather in some chief place chosen by God, \nwhere there would be both the high-priest, who would decide doubtful \nmatters relating to the ceremonies of divine worship; and the chief judge \nof the people, who would decide matters relating to the judgments of men: \njust as even now cases are taken from a lower to a higher court either by \nappeal or by consultation. Hence it is written (Dt. 17:8,9): \"If thou \nperceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful matter in judgment . \n. . and thou see that the  words of the judges within thy gates do vary; \narise and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and \nthou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to the judge \nthat shall be at that time.\" But such like doubtful matters did not often \noccur for judgment: wherefore the people were not burdened on this \naccount.\nReply to Objection 8: In the business affairs of men, there is no such thing as \ndemonstrative and infallible proof, and we must be content with a certain \nconjectural probability, such as that which an orator employs to \npersuade. Consequently, although it is quite possible for two or three \nwitnesses to agree to a falsehood, yet it is neither easy nor probable \nthat they succeed in so doing: wherefore their testimony is taken as \nbeing true, especially if they do not waver in giving it, or are not \notherwise suspect. Moreover, in order that witnesses might not easily \ndepart from the truth, the Law commanded that they should be most \ncarefully examined, and that those who were found untruthful should be \nseverely punished, as stated in Dt. 19:16, seqq.\nThere was, however, a reason for fixing on this particular number, in \ntoken of the unerring truth of the Divine Persons, Who are sometimes \nmentioned as two, because the Holy Ghost is the bond of the other two \nPersons; and sometimes as three: as Augustine observes on Jn. 8:17: \"In \nyour law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.\"\nReply to Objection 9: A severe punishment is inflicted not only on account of the \ngravity of a fault, but also for other reasons. First, on account of the \ngreatness of the sin, because a greater sin, other things being equal, \ndeserves a greater punishment. Secondly, on account of a habitual sin, \nsince men are not easily cured of habitual sin except by severe \npunishments. Thirdly, on account of a great desire for or a great \npleasure in the sin: for men are not easily deterred from such sins \nunless they be severely punished. Fourthly, on account of the facility of \ncommitting a sin and of concealing it: for such like sins, when \ndiscovered, should be more severely punished in order to deter others \nfrom committing them.\nAgain, with regard to the greatness of a sin, four degrees may be \nobserved, even in respect of one single deed. The first is when a sin is \ncommitted unwillingly; because then, if the sin be altogether \ninvoluntary, man is altogether excused from punishment; for it is written \n(Dt. 22:25, seqq.) that a damsel who suffers violence in a field is not \nguilty of death, because \"she cried, and there was no man to help her.\" \nBut if a man sinned in any way voluntarily, and yet through weakness, as \nfor instance when a man sins from passion, the sin is diminished: and the \npunishment, according to true judgment, should be diminished also; unless \nperchance the common weal requires that the sin be severely punished in \norder to deter others from committing such sins, as stated above. The \nsecond degree is when a man sins through ignorance: and then he was held \nto be guilty to a certain extent,  on account of his negligence in \nacquiring knowledge: yet he was not punished by the judges but expiated \nhis sin by sacrifices. Hence it is written (Lev. 4:2): \"The soul that \nsinneth through ignorance,\" etc. This is, however, to be taken as \napplying to ignorance of fact; and not to ignorance of the Divine \nprecept, which all were bound to know. The third degree was when a man \nsinned from pride, i.e. through deliberate choice or malice: and then he \nwas punished according to the greatness of the sin [*Cf. Dt. 25:2]. The \nfourth degree was when a man sinned from stubbornness or obstinacy: and \nthen he was to be utterly cut off as a rebel and a destroyer of the \ncommandment of the Law [*Cf. Num. 15:30,31].\nAccordingly we must say that, in appointing the punishment for theft, \nthe Law considered what would be likely to happen most frequently (Ex. 22:1-9): wherefore, as regards theft of other things which can easily be \nsafeguarded from a thief, the thief restored only twice their value. But \nsheep cannot be easily safeguarded from a thief, because they graze in \nthe fields: wherefore it happened more frequently that sheep were stolen \nin the fields. Consequently the Law inflicted a heavier penalty, by \nordering four sheep to be restored for the theft of one. As to cattle, \nthey were yet more difficult to safeguard, because they are kept in the \nfields, and do not graze in flocks as sheep do; wherefore a yet more \nheavy penalty was inflicted in their regard, so that five oxen were to be \nrestored for one ox. And this I say, unless perchance the animal itself \nwere discovered in the thief's possession: because in that case he had to \nrestore only twice the number, as in the case of other thefts: for there \nwas reason to presume that he intended to restore the animal, since he \nkept it alive. Again, we might say, according to a gloss, that \"a cow is \nuseful in five ways: it may be used for sacrifice, for ploughing, for \nfood, for milk, and its hide is employed for various purposes\": and \ntherefore for one cow five had to be restored. But the sheep was useful \nin four ways: \"for sacrifice, for meat, for milk, and for its wool.\" The \nunruly son was slain, not because he ate and drank: but on account of his \nstubbornness and rebellion, which was always punished by death, as stated \nabove. As to the man who gathered sticks on the sabbath, he was stoned as \na breaker of the Law, which commanded the sabbath to be observed, to \ntestify the belief in the newness of the world, as stated above (Question [100], Article [5]): wherefore he was slain as an unbeliever.",
        "CON": "It is recalled as a special blessing (Ps. 147:20) that \n\"He hath not done in like manner to every nation; and His judgments He \nhath not made manifest to them.\"",
        "ANS": "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21), quoting Tully, \"a \nnation is a body of men united together by consent to the law and by \ncommunity of welfare.\" Consequently it is of the essence of a nation that \nthe mutual relations of the citizens be ordered by just laws. Now the \nrelations of one man with another are twofold: some are effected under \nthe guidance of those in authority: others are effected by the will of \nprivate individuals. And since whatever is subject to the power of an \nindividual can be disposed of according to his will, hence it is that the \ndecision of matters between one man and another, and the punishment of \nevildoers, depend on the direction of those in authority, to whom men are \nsubject. On the other hand, the power of private persons is exercised \nover the things they possess: and consequently their dealings with one \nanother, as regards such things, depend on their own will, for instance \nin buying, selling, giving, and so forth. Now the Law provided \nsufficiently in respect of each of these relations between one man and \nanother. For it established judges, as is clearly indicated in Dt. 16:18: \n\"Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all its [Vulg.: 'thy'] \ngates . . . that they may judge the people with just judgment.\" It is \nalso directed the  manner of pronouncing just judgments, according to Dt. \n1:16,17: \"Judge that which is just, whether he be one of your own country \nor a stranger: there shall be no difference of persons.\" It also removed \nan occasion of pronouncing unjust judgment, by forbidding judges to \naccept bribes (Ex. 23:8; Dt. 16:19). It prescribed the number of \nwitnesses, viz. two or three: and it appointed certain punishments to \ncertain crimes, as we shall state farther on (ad 10).\nBut with regard to possessions, it is a very good thing, says the \nPhilosopher (Polit. ii, 2) that the things possessed should be distinct, \nand the use thereof should be partly common, and partly granted to others \nby the will of the possessors. These three points were provided for by \nthe Law. Because, in the first place, the possessions themselves were \ndivided among individuals: for it is written (Num. 33:53,54): \"I have \ngiven you\" the land \"for a possession: and you shall divide it among you \nby lot.\" And since many states have been ruined through want of \nregulations in the matter of possessions, as the Philosopher observes \n(Polit. ii, 6); therefore the Law provided a threefold remedy against the \nregularity of possessions. The first was that they should be divided \nequally, wherefore it is written (Num. 33:54): \"To the more you shall \ngive a larger part, and to the fewer, a lesser.\" A second remedy was that \npossessions could not be alienated for ever, but after a certain lapse of \ntime should return to their former owner, so as to avoid confusion of \npossessions (cf. ad 3). The third remedy aimed at the removal of this \nconfusion, and provided that the dead should be succeeded by their next \nof kin: in the first place, the son; secondly, the daughter; thirdly, the \nbrother; fourthly, the father's brother; fifthly, any other next of kin. \nFurthermore, in order to preserve the distinction of property, the Law \nenacted that heiresses should marry within their own tribe, as recorded \nin Num. 36:6.\nSecondly, the Law commanded that, in some respects, the use of things \nshould belong to all in common. Firstly, as regards the care of them; for \nit was prescribed (Dt. 22:1-4): \"Thou shalt not pass by, if thou seest \nthy brother's ox or his sheep go astray; but thou shalt bring them back \nto thy brother,\" and in like manner as to other things. Secondly, as \nregards fruits. For all alike were allowed on entering a friend's \nvineyard to eat of the fruit, but not to take any away. And, specially, \nwith respect to the poor, it was prescribed that the forgotten sheaves, \nand the bunches of grapes and fruit, should be left behind for them (Lev. \n19:9; Dt. 24:19). Moreover, whatever grew in the seventh year was common \nproperty, as stated in Ex. 23:11 and Lev. 25:4.\nThirdly, the law recognized the transference of goods by the owner. \nThere was a purely gratuitous transfer: thus it is written (Dt. 14:28,29): \"The third day thou shalt separate another tithe . . . and the \nLevite . . . and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow . . . \nshall come and shall eat and be filled.\" And there was a transfer for a \nconsideration, for instance, by selling and buying, by letting out and \nhiring, by loan and also by deposit,  concerning all of which we find \nthat the Law made ample provision. Consequently it is clear that the Old \nLaw provided sufficiently concerning the mutual relations of one man with \nanother.",
        "RP1": "As the Apostle says (Rm. 13:8), \"he that loveth his \nneighbor hath fulfilled the Law\": because, to wit, all the precepts of \nthe Law, chiefly those concerning our neighbor, seem to aim at the end \nthat men should love one another. Now it is an effect of love that men \ngive their own goods to others: because, as stated in 1 Jn. 3:17: \"He \nthat . . . shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels \nfrom him: how doth the charity of God abide in him?\" Hence the purpose of \nthe Law was to accustom men to give of their own to others readily: thus \nthe Apostle (1 Tim. 6:18) commands the rich \"to give easily and to \ncommunicate to others.\" Now a man does not give easily to others if he \nwill not suffer another man to take some little thing from him without \nany great injury to him. And so the Law laid down that it should be \nlawful for a man, on entering his neighbor's vineyard, to eat of the \nfruit there: but not to carry any away, lest this should lead to the \ninfliction of a grievous harm, and cause a disturbance of the peace: for \namong well-behaved people, the taking of a little does not disturb the \npeace; in fact, it rather strengthens friendship and accustoms men to \ngive things to one another.\n: The Old Law inflicted the death penalty for the more \ngrievous crimes, viz. for those which are committed against God, and for \nmurder, for stealing a man, irreverence towards one's parents, adultery \nand incest. In the case of thief of other things it inflicted punishment \nby indemnification: while in the case of blows and mutilation it \nauthorized punishment by retaliation; and likewise for the sin of bearing \nfalse witness. In other faults of less degree it prescribed the \npunishment of stripes or of public disgrace.\nThe punishment of slavery was prescribed by the Law in two cases. First, \nin the case of a slave who was unwilling to avail  himself of the \nprivilege granted by the Law, whereby he was free to depart in the \nseventh year of remission: wherefore he was punished by remaining a slave \nfor ever. Secondly, in the case of a thief, who had not wherewith to make \nrestitution, as stated in Ex. 22:3.\nThe punishment of absolute exile was not prescribed by the Law: because \nGod was worshipped by that people alone, whereas all other nations were \ngiven to idolatry: wherefore if any man were exiled from that people \nabsolutely, he would be in danger of falling into idolatry. For this \nreason it is related (1 Kgs. 26:19) that David said to Saul: \"They are \ncursed in the sight of the Lord, who have case me out this day, that I \nshould not dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve \nstrange gods.\" There was, however, a restricted sort of exile: for it is \nwritten in Dt. 19:4 [*Cf. Num. 35:25] that \"he that striketh [Vulg.: \n'killeth'] his neighbor ignorantly, and is proved to have had no hatred \nagainst him, shall flee to one of the cities\" of refuge and \"abide there \nuntil the death of the high-priest.\" For then it became lawful for him to \nreturn home, because when the whole people thus suffered a loss they \nforgot their private quarrels, so that the next of kin of the slain were \nnot so eager to kill the slayer.\n: Dumb animals were ordered to be slain, not on account of \nany fault of theirs; but as a punishment to their owners, who had not \nsafeguarded their beasts from these offenses. Hence the owner was more \nseverely punished if his ox had butted anyone \"yesterday or the day \nbefore\" (in which case steps might have been taken to butting suddenly). \nOr again, the animal was slain in detestation of the sin; and lest men \nshould be horrified at the sight thereof.\n: The literal reason for this commandment, as Rabbi Moses \ndeclares (Doct. Perplex. iii), was because the slayer was frequently from \nthe nearest city: wherefore the slaying of the calf was a means of \ninvestigating the hidden murder. This was brought about in three ways. In \nthe first place the elders of the city swore that they had taken every \nmeasure for safeguarding the roads. Secondly, the owner of the heifer was \nindemnified for the slaying of his beast, and if the murder was \npreviously discovered, the beast was not slain. Thirdly, the place, where \nthe heifer was slain, remained uncultivated. Wherefore, in order to avoid \nthis twofold loss, the men of the city would readily make known the \nmurderer, if they knew who he was: and it would seldom happen but that \nsome word or sign would escape about the matter. Or again, this was done \nin order to frighten people, in detestation of murder. Because the \nslaying of a heifer, which is a useful animal and full of strength, \nespecially before it has been put under the yoke, signified that whoever \ncommitted murder, however useful and strong he might be, was to forfeit \nhis life; and that, by a cruel death, which was implied by the striking \noff of its head; and that the murderer, as vile and abject, was to be cut \noff from the fellowship of men, which was betokened by the fact that the \nheifer after being slain was left to rot in a rough and uncultivated \nplace.\nMystically, the heifer taken from the herd signifies the flesh of \nChrist; which had not drawn a yoke, since it had done no sin; nor did it \nplough the ground, i.e. it never knew the stain of revolt. The fact of \nthe heifer being killed in an uncultivated valley signified the despised \ndeath of Christ, whereby all sins are washed away, and the devil is shown \nto be the arch-murderer.",
        "RP2": "The Law did not prescribe that women should succeed to \ntheir father's estate except in default of male issue: failing which it \nwas necessary that succession should be granted to the female line in \norder to comfort the father, who would have been sad to think that his \nestate would pass to strangers. Nevertheless the Law observed due caution \nin the matter, by providing that those women who succeeded to their \nfather's estate, should marry within their own tribe, in order to avoid \nconfusion of tribal possessions, as stated in Num. 36:7,8.",
        "RP3": "As the Philosopher says (Polit. ii, 4), the regulation of \npossessions conduces much to the preservation of a state or nation. \nConsequently, as he himself observes, it was forbidden by the law in some \nof the heathen states, \"that anyone should sell his possessions, except \nto avoid a manifest loss.\" For if possessions were to be sold \nindiscriminately, they might happen to come into the hands of a few: so \nthat it might become necessary for a state or country to become void of \ninhabitants. Hence the Old Law, in order to remove this danger, ordered \nthings in such a way that while provision was made for men's needs, by \nallowing the sale of possessions to avail for a certain period, at the \nsame time the said danger was removed, by prescribing the return of those \npossessions after that period had elapsed. The reason for this law was to \nprevent confusion of possessions, and to ensure the continuance of a \ndefinite distinction among the tribes.\nBut as the town houses were not allotted to distinct estates, therefore \nthe Law allowed them to be sold in perpetuity, like movable goods. \nBecause the number of houses in a town was not fixed, whereas there was a \nfixed limit to the amount of estates,  which could not be exceeded, while \nthe number of houses in a town could be increased. On the other hand, \nhouses situated not in a town, but \"in a village that hath no walls,\" \ncould not be sold in perpetuity: because such houses are built merely \nwith a view to the cultivation and care of possessions; wherefore the Law \nrightly made the same prescription in regard to both (Lev. 25).",
        "RP4": "As stated above (ad 1), the purpose of the Law was to \naccustom men to its precepts, so as to be ready to come to one another's \nassistance: because this is a very great incentive to friendship. The Law \ngranted these facilities for helping others in the matter not only of \ngratuitous and absolute donations, but also of mutual transfers: because \nthe latter kind of succor is more frequent and benefits the greater \nnumber: and it granted facilities for this purpose in many ways. First of \nall by prescribing that men should be ready to lend, and that they should \nnot be less inclined to do so as the year of remission drew nigh, as \nstated in Dt. 15:7, seqq. Secondly, by forbidding them to burden a man to \nwhom they might grant a loan, either by exacting usury, or by accepting \nnecessities of life in security; and by prescribing that when this had \nbeen done they should be restored at once. For it is written (Dt. 23:19): \n\"Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury\": and (Dt. 24:6): \n\"Thou shalt not take the nether nor the upper millstone to pledge; for he \nhath pledged his life to thee\": and (Ex. 22:26): \"If thou take of thy \nneighbor a garment in pledge, thou shalt give it him again before \nsunset.\" Thirdly, by forbidding them to be importunate in exacting \npayment. Hence it is written (Ex. 22:25): \"If thou lend money to any of \nmy people that is poor that dwelleth with thee, thou shalt not be hard \nupon them as an extortioner.\" For this reason, too, it is enacted (Dt. 24:10,11): \"When thou shalt demand of thy neighbor anything that he oweth \nthee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge, but thou \nshalt stand without, and he shall bring out to thee what he hath\": both \nbecause a man's house is his surest refuge, wherefore it is offensive to \na man to be set upon in his own house; and because the Law does not allow \nthe creditor to take away whatever he likes in security, but rather \npermits the debtor to give what he needs least. Fourthly, the Law \nprescribed that debts should cease together after the lapse of seven \nyears. For it was probable that those who could conveniently pay their \ndebts, would do so before the seventh year, and would not defraud the \nlender without cause. But if they were altogether insolvent, there was \nthe same reason for remitting the debt from love for them, as there was \nfor renewing the loan on account of their need.\nAs regards animals granted in loan, the Law enacted that if, through the \nneglect of the person to whom they were lent, they perished or \ndeteriorated in his absence, he was bound to make restitution. But if \nthey perished or deteriorated while he was present and taking proper care \nof them, he was not bound to make restitution, especially if they were \nhired for a consideration: because they might have died or deteriorated \nin the same way if they had remained in possession of the lender, so that \nif the animal had been saved through being lent, the lender would have  \ngained something by the loan which would no longer have been gratuitous. \nAnd especially was this to be observed when animals were hired for a \nconsideration: because then the owner received a certain price for the \nuse of the animals; wherefore he had no right to any profit, by receiving \nindemnity for the animal, unless the person who had charge of it were \nnegligent. In the case, however, of animals not hired for a \nconsideration, equity demanded that he should receive something by way of \nrestitution at least to the value of the hire of the animal that had \nperished or deteriorated."

For the Jews were offered three opportunities of \npeaceful relations with foreigners. First, when foreigners passed through \ntheir land as travelers. Secondly, when they came to dwell in their land \nas newcomers. And in both these respects the Law made kind provision in \nits precepts: for it is written (Ex. 22:21): \"Thou shalt not molest a \nstranger [advenam]\"; and again (Ex. 22:9): \"Thou shalt not molest a \nstranger [peregrino].\" Thirdly, when any foreigners wished to be admitted \nentirely to their fellowship and mode of worship. With regard to these a \ncertain order was observed. For they were not at once admitted to \ncitizenship: just as it was law with some nations that no one was deemed \na citizen except after two or three generations, as the Philosopher says \n(Polit. iii, 1). The reason for this was that if foreigners were allowed \nto meddle with the affairs of a nation as soon as they settled down in \nits midst, many dangers might occur, since the foreigners not yet having \nthe common good firmly at heart might attempt something hurtful to the \npeople. Hence it was that the Law prescribed in respect of certain \nnations that had close relations with the Jews (viz., the Egyptians among \nwhom they were born and educated, and the Idumeans, the children of Esau, \nJacob's brother), that they should be admitted to the fellowship of the \npeople after the third generation; whereas others (with whom their \nrelations had been hostile, such as the Ammonites and Moabites) were \nnever to be admitted to citizenship; while the Amalekites, who were yet \nmore hostile to them, and had no fellowship of kindred with them, were to \nbe held as foes in perpetuity: for it is written (Ex. 17:16): \"The war of \nthe Lord shall be against Amalec from generation to generation.\"\nIn like manner with regard to hostile relations with foreigners, the Law \ncontained suitable precepts. For, in the first place, it commanded that \nwar should be declared for a just cause: thus it is commanded (Dt. 20:10) \nthat when they advanced to besiege a city, they should at first make an \noffer of peace. Secondly, it enjoined that when once they had entered on \na war they should undauntedly persevere in it, putting their trust in \nGod. And in order that they might be the more heedful of this command, it \nordered that on the approach of battle the priest should hearten them by \npromising them God's aid. Thirdly, it prescribed the removal of whatever \nmight prove an obstacle to the fight, and that certain men, who might be \nin the way, should be sent home. Fourthly, it enjoined that they should \nuse moderation in pursuing  the advantage of victory, by sparing women \nand children, and by not cutting down fruit-trees of that country.",

For just as one man is punished for a sin \ncommitted by him, in order that others seeing this may be deterred and \nrefrain from sinning; so too may one nation or city be punished for a \ncrime, that others may refrain from similar crimes.\nNevertheless it was possible by dispensation for a man to be admitted to \ncitizenship on account of some act of virtue: thus it is related (Judith \n14:6) that Achior, the captain of the children of Ammon, \"was joined to \nthe people of Israel, with all the succession of his kindred.\" The same \napplies to Ruth the Moabite who was \"a virtuous woman\" (Ruth 3:11): \nalthough it may be said that this prohibition regarded men and not women, \nwho are not competent to be citizens absolutely speaking.",

On the \nother hand, any man may be called citizen, only in a restricted sense, if \nhe dwells within the state, even common people or children or old men, \nwho are not fit to enjoy power in matters pertaining to the common weal. \nFor this reason bastards, by reason of their base origin, were excluded \nfrom the \"ecclesia,\" i.e. from the popular assembly, down to the tenth \ngeneration.

When, however, the woman was willing to \nrenounce idolatry, and become an adherent of the Law, it was lawful to \ntake her in marriage: as was the case with Ruth whom Booz married. \nWherefore she said to her mother-in-law (Ruth 1:16): \"Thy people shall be \nmy people, and thy God my God.\" Accordingly it was not permitted to marry \na captive woman unless she first shaved her hair, and pared her nails, \nand put off the raiment wherein she was taken, and mourned for her father \nand mother, in token that she renounced idolatry for ever.\nReply to Objection 7: As Chrysostom says (Hom. xlviii super Matth.), \"because \ndeath was an unmitigated evil for the Jews, who did everything with a \nview to the present life, it was ordained that children should be born to \nthe dead man through his brother: thus affording a certain mitigation to \nhis death.

But this does not apply to a son in \nrespect of his father, or to a servant in respect of his master: because \nthe latter infidelity is not the result of the lust of pleasure, but \nrather of malice: nor can it remain hidden like the infidelity of an \nadulterous woman.",

        "ANS": "The mutual relations of the members of a household regard \neveryday actions directed to the necessities of life, as the Philosopher \nstates (Polit. i, 1). Now the preservation of man's life may be \nconsidered from two points of view. First, from the point of view of the \nindividual, i.e. in so far as man preserves his individuality: and for \nthe purpose of the preservation of life, considered from this standpoint, \nman has at his service external goods, by means of which he provides \nhimself with food and clothing and other such necessaries of life: in the \nhandling of which he has need of servants. Secondly man's life is \npreserved from the point of view of the species, by means of generation, \nfor which purpose man needs a wife, that she may bear him children. \nAccordingly the mutual relations of the members of a household admit of a \nthreefold combination: viz. those of master and servant, those of husband \nand wife, and those of father and son: and in respect of all these \nrelationships the Old Law contained fitting precepts. Thus, with regard \nto servants, it commanded them to be treated with moderation---both as to \ntheir work, lest, to wit, they should be burdened with excessive labor, \nwherefore the Lord commanded (Dt. 5:14) that on the Sabbath day \"thy \nmanservant and thy maidservant\" should \"rest even as thyself\"---and also \nas to the infliction of punishment, for it ordered those who maimed their \nservants, to set them free (Ex. 21:26,27). Similar provision was made in \nfavor of a maidservant when married to anyone (Ex. 21:7, seqq.). \nMoreover, with regard to those servants in particular who were taken from \namong the people, the Law prescribed that they should go out free in the \nseventh year taking whatever they brought with them, even their clothes \n(Ex. 21:2, seqq.): and furthermore it was commanded (Dt. 15:13) that they \nshould be given provision for the journey.\nWith regard to wives the Law made certain prescriptions as to those who \nwere to be taken in marriage: for instance, that they should marry a wife \nfrom their own tribe (Num. 36:6): and this lest confusion should ensue in \nthe property of various tribes. Also that a man should marry the wife of \nhis deceased brother when the latter died without issue, as prescribed in \nDt. 25:5,6: and this in order that he who could not have successors \naccording to carnal origin, might at least have them by a kind of \nadoption, and that thus the deceased might not be entirely forgotten. It \nalso forbade them to marry certain women; to wit, women of strange \nnations, through fear of their losing their faith; and those of their \nnear kindred, on account of the natural respect due to them. Furthermore \nit prescribed in what way wives were to be treated after marriage. To \nwit, that they should not be slandered without grave reason: wherefore it \nordered punishment to be inflicted on the man who falsely accused his \nwife of a crime (Dt. 22:13, seqq.). Also that a man's hatred of his wife \nshould not be detrimental to his son (Dt. 21:15, seqq.). Again, that a \nman should not ill-use his wife through hatred of her, but rather that he \nshould write a bill of divorce and send her away (Dt. 24:1). Furthermore, \nin order to foster conjugal love from the very outset, it was prescribed \nthat no public duties should be laid on a recently married man, so that \nhe might be free to rejoice with his wife.\nWith regard to children, the Law commanded parents to educate them by \ninstructing them in the faith: hence it is written (Ex. 12:26, seqq.): \n\"When your children shall say to you: What is the meaning of this \nservice? You shall say to them: It is the victim of the passage of the \nLord.\" Moreover, they are commanded to teach them the rules of right \nconduct: wherefore it is written (Dt. 21:20) that the parents had to say: \n\"He slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling and \nto debauchery.\"",

        "RP3": "With regard to the ill-treatment of servants, the Law seems \nto have taken into consideration whether it was certain or not: since if \nit were certain, the Law fixed a penalty: for maiming, the penalty was \nforfeiture of the servant, who was ordered to be given his liberty: while \nfor slaying, the punishment was that of a murderer, when the slave died \nunder the blow of his master. If, however, the hurt was not certain, but \nonly probable, the Law did not impose any penalty as regards a man's own \nservant: for instance if the servant did not die at once after being \nstruck, but after some days: for it would be uncertain whether he died as \na result of the blows he received. For when a man struck a free man, yet \nso that he did not die at once, but \"walked abroad again upon his staff,\" \nhe that struck him was quit of murder, even though afterwards he died. \nNevertheless he was bound to pay the doctor's fees incurred by the victim \nof his assault. But this was not the case if a man killed his own \nservant: because whatever the servant had, even his very person, was the \nproperty of his master.

This is shown by the very words of \nthe Law, where we read: \"If any man sell his daughter to be a servant, \nshe shall not go out as bondwomen are wont to go out.\" Moreover, in this \nway a man might sell not only his son, but even himself, rather as a \nhireling than as a slave,  according to Lev. 25:39,40: \"If thy brother, \nconstrained by poverty, sell himself to thee, thou shalt not oppress him \nwith the service of bondservants: but he shall be as a hireling and a \nsojourner.\""

        "ANS": "Three reasons may be assigned why it was not fitting for \nthe New Law to be given from the beginning of the world. The first is \nbecause the New Law, as stated above (Article [1]), consists chiefly in the \ngrace of the Holy Ghost: which it behoved not to be given abundantly \nuntil sin, which is an obstacle to  grace, had been cast out of man \nthrough the accomplishment of his redemption by Christ: wherefore it is \nwritten (Jn. 7:39): \"As yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was \nnot yet glorified.\" This reason the Apostle states clearly (Rm. 8:2, seqq.) where, after speaking of \"the Law of the Spirit of life,\" he adds: \n\"God sending His own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, of sin* hath \ncondemned sin in the flesh, that the justification of the Law might be \nfulfilled in us.\" [*St. Thomas, quoting perhaps from memory, omits the \n\"et\" (and), after \"sinful flesh.\" The text quoted should read thus: \"in \nthe likeness of sinful flesh, and a sin offering ({peri hamartias}), \nhath,\" etc.]\nA second reason may be taken from the perfection of the New Law. Because \na thing is not brought to perfection at once from the outset, but through \nan orderly succession of time; thus one is at first a boy, and then a \nman. And this reason is stated by the Apostle (Gal. 3:24,25): \"The Law \nwas our pedagogue in Christ that we might be justified by faith. But \nafter the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.\"\nThe third reason is found in the fact that the New Law is the law of \ngrace: wherefore it behoved man first of all to be left to himself under \nthe state of the Old Law, so that through falling into sin, he might \nrealize his weakness, and acknowledge his need of grace. This reason is \nset down by the Apostle (Rm. 5:20): \"The Law entered in, that sin might \nabound: and when sin abounded grace did more abound.\"",

Justit. iv) [*Cf. Ep. ccvii; De Pecc. Mer. \net Rem. ii, 19].

Now no \nstate of the present life can be more perfect that the state of the New \nLaw: since nothing can approach nearer to the last end than that which is \nthe immediate cause of our being brought to the last end.

Now things ordained to an end may be \ndivided in two ways, considered from the point of view of the end. First, \nthrough being ordained to different ends: and this difference will be \nspecific, especially if such ends are proximate. Secondly, by reason of \nbeing closely or remotely connected with the end. Thus it is clear that \nmovements differ in species through being directed to different terms: \nwhile according as one part of a movement is nearer to the term than \nanother part, the difference of perfect and imperfect movement is \nassessed.\nAccordingly then two laws may be distinguished from one another in two \nways. First, through being altogether diverse, from the fact that they \nare ordained to diverse ends: thus a state-law ordained to democratic \ngovernment, would differ specifically from a law ordained to government \nby the aristocracy. Secondly, two laws may be distinguished from one \nanother, through one of them being more closely connected with the end, \nand the other more remotely: thus in one and the same state there is one \nlaw enjoined on men of mature age, who can forthwith accomplish that \nwhich pertains to the common good; and another law regulating the \neducation of children who need to be taught how they are to achieve manly \ndeeds later on.\nWe must therefore say that, according to the first way, the New Law is \nnot distinct from the Old Law: because they both have the same end, \nnamely, man's subjection to God; and there is but one God of the New and \nof the Old Testament, according to Rm. 3:30: \"It is one God that \njustifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.\" \nAccording to the second way, the New Law is distinct from the Old Law: \nbecause the Old Law is like a pedagogue of children, as the Apostle says \n(Gal. 3:24), whereas the New Law is the law of perfection, since it is \nthe law of charity, of which the Apostle says (Col. 3:14) that it is \"the \nbond of perfection.\"",

        "RP2": "All the differences assigned between the Old and New Laws \nare gathered from their relative perfection and imperfection. For the \nprecepts of every law prescribe acts of virtue. Now the imperfect, who as \nyet are not possessed of a virtuous habit, are directed in one way to \nperform virtuous acts, while those who are perfected by the possession of \nvirtuous habits are directed in another way. For those who as yet are not \nendowed with virtuous habits, are directed to the performance of virtuous \nacts by reason of some outward cause: for instance, by the threat of \npunishment, or the promise of some extrinsic rewards, such as honor, \nriches, or the like. Hence the Old Law, which was given to men who were \nimperfect, that is, who had not yet received spiritual grace, was called \nthe \"law of fear,\" inasmuch as it induced men to observe its commandments \nby threatening them with penalties; and is spoken of as containing \ntemporal promises. On the other hand, those who are possessed of virtue, \nare inclined to do virtuous deeds through love of virtue, not on account \nof some extrinsic punishment or reward. Hence the New Law which derives \nits pre-eminence from the spiritual grace instilled into our hearts, is \ncalled the \"Law of love\": and it is described as containing spiritual and \neternal promises, which are objects of the virtues, chiefly of charity. \nAccordingly such persons are inclined of themselves to those objects, not \nas to something foreign but as to something of their own. For this \nreason, too, the Old Law is described as \"restraining the hand, not the \nwill\" [*Peter Lombard, Sent. iii, D, 40]; since when a man refrains from \nsome sins through fear of being punished, his will does not shrink simply \nfrom sin, as does the will of a man who refrains from sin through love of \nrighteousness: and hence the New Law, which is the Law of love, is said \nto restrain the will.\nNevertheless there were some in the state of the Old Testament who, \nhaving charity and the grace of the Holy Ghost, looked chiefly to \nspiritual and eternal promises: and in this respect they belonged to the \nNew Law. In like manner in the New Testament there are some carnal men \nwho have not yet attained to the perfection of the New Law; and these it \nwas necessary, even under the New Testament, to lead to virtuous action \nby the fear of punishment and by temporal promises.\nBut although the Old Law contained precepts of charity, nevertheless it \ndid not confer the Holy Ghost by Whom \"charity . . . is spread abroad in \nour hearts\" (Rm. 5:5).",

Nevertheless it consists secondarily in certain \ndeeds, moral and sacramental: but the New  Law does not consist chiefly \nin these latter things, as did the Old Law. As to those under the Old \nTestament who through faith were acceptable to God, in this respect they \nbelonged to the New Testament: for they were not justified except through \nfaith in Christ, Who is the Author of the New Testament.

The same is also clear with respect to the prohibition of \nretaliation. For the Law fixed a limit to revenge, by forbidding men to \nseek vengeance unreasonably: whereas Our Lord deprived them of vengeance \nmore completely by commanding them to abstain from it altogether. With \nregard to the hatred of one's enemies, He dispelled the false \ninterpretation of the Pharisees, by admonishing us to hate, not the \nperson, but his sin.

The Law, however, could not accomplish \nthis: but foreshadowed it by certain ceremonial actions, and promised it \nin words. And in this respect, the New Law fulfils the Old by justifying \nmen through the power of Christ's Passion. This is what the Apostle says \n(Rm. 8:3,4): \"What the Law could not do . . . God sending His own Son in \nthe likeness of sinful flesh . . . hath condemned sin in the flesh, that \nthe justification of the Law might be fulfilled in us.\" And in this \nrespect, the New Law gives what the Old Law promised, according to 2 Cor. \n1:20: \"Whatever are the promises of God, in Him,\" i.e. in Christ, \"they \nare 'Yea'.\" [*The Douay version reads thus: \"All the promises of God are \nin Him, 'It is'.\"] Again, in this respect, it also fulfils what the Old \nLaw foreshadowed.

This is clear in the case of murder and \nadultery, the prohibition of which the Scribes and Pharisees thought to \nrefer only to the exterior act: wherefore Our Lord fulfilled the Law by \nshowing that the prohibition extended also to the interior acts of sins. \nSecondly, Our Lord fulfilled the precepts of the Law by prescribing the \nsafest way of complying with the statutes of the Old Law. Thus the Old \nLaw forbade perjury: and this is more safely avoided, by abstaining \naltogether from swearing, save in cases of urgency. Thirdly, Our Lord \nfulfilled the precepts of the Law, by adding some counsels of perfection: \nthis is clearly seen in Mt. 19:21, where Our Lord said to the man who \naffirmed that he had kept all the precepts of the Old Law: \"One thing is \nwanting to thee: If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell whatsoever thou hast,\" \netc. [*St. Thomas combines Mt. 19:21 with Mk. 10:21].",

Wherefore from the \nvery fact that the ceremonial precepts were fulfilled when those things \nwere accomplished which they foreshadowed, it follows that they are no \nlonger to be observed: for it they were to be observed, this would mean \nthat something is still to be accomplished and is not yet fulfilled. Thus \nthe promise of a future gift holds no longer when it has been fulfilled \nby the presentation of the gift. In this way the legal ceremonies are \nabolished by being fulfilled.",

But Our Lord, \nWho healed the leper, could not contract an uncleanness. By those things \nwhich He did on the sabbath, He did not break the sabbath in reality, as \nthe Master Himself shows in the Gospel: both because He worked miracles \nby His Divine power, which is ever active among things; and because He \nworked miracles by His Divine power, which is ever active among things; \nand because His works were concerned with the salvation of man, while the \nPharisees were concerned for the well-being of animals even on the \nsabbath; and again because on account of urgency He excused His disciples \nfor gathering the ears of corn on the sabbath. But He did seem to break \nthe sabbath according to the superstitious interpretation of the \nPharisees, who thought that man ought to abstain from doing even works of \nkindness on the sabbath; which was contrary to the intention of the Law.",

But of the judicial precepts He \nmentioned that of retaliation: so that what He said about it should refer \nto all the others. With regard to this precept, He taught that the \nintention of the Law was that retaliation should be sought out of love of \njustice, and not as a punishment out of revengeful spite, which He \nforbade, admonishing man to be ready to suffer yet greater insults; and \nthis remains still in the New Law."

One is on the part of the \noutward works, which of themselves are, in a way, difficult and \nburdensome. And in this respect the Old Law is a much heavier burden than \nthe New: since the Old Law by its numerous ceremonies prescribed many \nmore outward acts than the New Law, which, in the teaching of Christ and \nthe apostles, added very few precepts to those of the natural law; \nalthough afterwards some were  added, through being instituted by the \nholy Fathers. Even in these Augustine says that moderation should be \nobserved, lest good conduct should become a burden to the faithful. For \nhe says in reply to the queries of Januarius (Ep. lv) that, \"whereas God \nin His mercy wished religion to be a free service rendered by the public \nsolemnization of a small number of most manifest sacraments, certain \npersons make it a slave's burden; so much so that the state of the Jews \nwho were subject to the sacraments of the Law, and not to the \npresumptuous devices of man, was more tolerable.\"\nThe other difficulty attaches to works of virtue as to interior acts: \nfor instance, that a virtuous deed be done with promptitude and pleasure. \nIt is this difficulty that virtue solves: because to act thus is \ndifficult for a man without virtue: but through virtue it becomes easy \nfor him. In this respect the precepts of the New Law are more burdensome \nthan those of the Old; because the New Law prohibits certain interior \nmovements of the soul, which were not expressly forbidden in the Old Law \nin all cases, although they were forbidden in some, without, however, any \npunishment being attached to the prohibition. Now this is very difficult \nto a man without virtue: thus even the Philosopher states (Ethic. v, 9) \nthat it is easy to do what a righteous man does; but that to do it in the \nsame way, viz. with pleasure and promptitude, is difficult to a man who \nis not righteous. Accordingly we read also (1 Jn. 5:3) that \"His \ncommandments are not heavy\": which words Augustine expounds by saying \nthat \"they are not heavy to the man that loveth; whereas they are a \nburden to him that loveth not.\"",

Hence it is written (Jn. 1:14): \"The Word was made flesh,\" \nand afterwards: \"full of grace and truth\"; and further on: \"Of His \nfulness we all have received, and grace for grace.\" Hence it is added \nthat \"grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\" Consequently it was becoming \nthat the grace flows from the incarnate Word should be given to us by \nmeans of certain external sensible objects; and that from this inward \ngrace, whereby the flesh is subjected to the Spirit, certain external \nworks should ensue.\nAccordingly external acts may have a twofold connection with grace.

Such are the \nsacramental acts which are instituted in the New Law, e.g. Baptism, the \nEucharist, and the like.\nIn the second place there are those external acts which ensue from the \npromptings of grace: and herein we must observe a difference. For there \nare some which are necessarily in keeping with, or in opposition to \ninward grace consisting in faith that worketh through love. Such external \nworks are prescribed or forbidden in the New Law; thus confession of \nfaith is prescribed, and denial of faith is forbidden; for it is written \n(Mt. 10:32,33) \"(Every one) that shall confess Me before men, I will also \nconfess him before My Father . . . But he that shall deny Me before men, \nI will also deny him before My Father.\" On the other hand, there are \nworks which are not necessarily opposed to, or in keeping with faith that \nworketh through love.

If, however, a habit be in opposition to nature, man would not \nact according to his nature, but according to some corruption affecting \nthat nature. Since then the grace of the Holy Ghost is like an interior \nhabit bestowed on us and inclining us to act aright, it makes us do \nfreely those things that are becoming to grace, and shun what is opposed \nto it.\nAccordingly the New Law is called the law of liberty in two respects. \nFirst, because it does not bind us to do or avoid certain things, except \nsuch as are of themselves necessary or opposed to salvation, and come \nunder the prescription or prohibition of the law. Secondly, because it \nalso makes us comply freely with these  precepts and prohibitions, \ninasmuch as we do so through the promptings of grace.

Nor must we wonder if He established certain fixed modes of life, \nas long as the state of the Old Law endured and the people had not as yet \nachieved the perfect liberty of the Spirit. These statutes He abolished \nshortly before His Passion, as though the disciples had by their means \nbecome sufficiently practiced. Hence He said (Lk. 22:35,36) \"When I sent \nyou without purse and scrip and shoes, did you want anything? But they \nsaid: Nothing.

Wherefore, in \nthe first place, He directs man's will in respect of the various precepts \nof the Law: by prescribing that man should refrain not merely from those \nexternal works that are evil in themselves, but also from internal acts, \nand from the occasions of evil deeds. In the second place He directs \nman's intention, by teaching that in our good works, we should seek  \nneither human praise, nor worldly riches, which is to lay up treasures on \nearth.\nAfterwards He directs man's interior movement in respect of his \nneighbor, by forbidding us, on the one hand, to judge him rashly, \nunjustly, or presumptuously; and, on the other, to entrust him too \nreadily with sacred things if he be unworthy.\nLastly, He teaches us how to fulfil the teaching of the Gospel; viz. by \nimploring the help of God; by striving to enter by the narrow door of \nperfect virtue; and by being wary lest we be led astray by evil \ninfluences. Moreover, He declares that we must observe His commandments, \nand that it is not enough to make profession of faith, or to work \nmiracles, or merely to hear His words.",
        "RP1": "Our Lord explained the manner of fulfilling those precepts \nwhich the Scribes and Pharisees did not rightly understand: and this \naffected chiefly those precepts of the decalogue. For they thought that \nthe prohibition of adultery and murder covered the external act only, and \nnot the internal desire. And they held this opinion about murder and \nadultery rather than about theft and false witness, because the movement \nof anger tending to murder, and the movement of desire tending to \nadultery, seem to be in us from nature somewhat, but not the desire of \nstealing or bearing false witness. They held a false opinion about \nperjury, for they thought that perjury indeed was a sin; but that oaths \nwere of themselves to be desired and to be taken frequently, since they \nseem to proceed from reverence to God. Hence Our Lord shows that an oath \nis not desirable as a good thing; and that it is better to speak without \noaths, unless necessity forces us to have recourse to them.",
        "RP2": "The Scribes and Pharisees erred about the judicial precepts \nin two ways. First, because they considered certain matters contained in \nthe Law of Moses by way of permission, to be right in themselves: namely, \ndivorce of a wife, and the taking of usury from strangers. Wherefore Our \nLord forbade a man to divorce his wife (Mt. 5:32); and to receive usury \n(Lk. 6:35), when He said: \"Lend, hoping for nothing thereby.\"\nIn another way they erred by thinking that certain things which the Old \nLaw commanded to be done for justice's sake, should be done out of desire \nfor revenge, or out of lust for temporal goods, or out of hatred of one's \nenemies; and this in respect of three precepts. For they thought that \ndesire for revenge was lawful, on account of the precept concerning \npunishment by retaliation: whereas this precept was given that justice \nmight be safeguarded, not that man might seek revenge. Wherefore, in \norder to do away with this, Our Lord teaches that man should be prepared \nin his mind to suffer yet more if necessary. They thought that movements \nof covetousness were lawful on account of those judicial precepts which \nprescribed restitution of what had been purloined, together with \nsomething added thereto, as stated above (Question [105], Article [2],  ad 9); whereas \nthe Law commanded this to be done in order to safeguard justice, not to \nencourage covetousness. Wherefore Our Lord teaches that we should not \ndemand our goods from motives of cupidity, and that we should be ready to \ngive yet more if necessary. They thought that the movement of hatred was \nlawful, on account of the commandments of the Law about the slaying of \none's enemies: whereas the Law ordered this for the fulfilment of \njustice, as stated above (Question [105], Article [3], ad 4), not to satisfy hatred. \nWherefore Our Lord teaches us that we ought to love our enemies, and to \nbe ready to do good to them if necessary. For these precepts are to be \ntaken as binding \"the mind to be prepared to fulfil them,\" as Augustine \nsays (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 19).",
        "RP3": "The moral precepts necessarily retained their force under \nthe New Law, because they are of themselves essential to virtue: whereas \nthe judicial precepts did not necessarily continue to bind in exactly the \nsame way as had been fixed by the Law: this was left to man to decide in \none way or another. Hence Our Lord directed us becomingly with regard to \nthese two kinds of precepts. On the other hand, the observance of the \nceremonial precepts was totally abolished by the advent of the reality; \nwherefore in regard to these precepts He commanded nothing on this \noccasion when He was giving the general points of His doctrine. \nElsewhere, however, He makes it clear that the entire bodily worship \nwhich was fixed by the Law, was to be changed into spiritual worship: as \nis evident from Jn. 4:21,23, where He says: \"The hour cometh when you \nshall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem adore the Father . . . \nbut . . . the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth.\"",
        "RP4": "All worldly goods may be reduced to three---honors, riches, \nand pleasures; according to 1 Jn. 2:16: \"All that is in the world is the \nconcupiscence of the flesh,\" which refers to pleasures of the flesh, \"and \nthe concupiscence of the eyes,\" which refers to riches, \"and the pride of \nlife,\" which refers to ambition for renown and honor. Now the Law did not \npromise an abundance of carnal pleasures; on the contrary, it forbade \nthem. But it did promise exalted honors and abundant riches; for it is \nwritten in reference to the former (Dt. 28:1): \"If thou wilt hear the \nvoice of the Lord thy God . . . He will make thee higher than all the \nnations\"; and in reference to the latter, we read a little further on \n(Dt. 28:11): \"He will make thee abound with all goods.\" But the Jews so \ndistorted the true meaning of these promises, as to think that we ought \nto serve God, with these things as the end in view. Wherefore Our Lord \nset this aside by teaching, first of all, that works of virtue should not \nbe done for human glory. And He mentions three works, to which all others \nmay be reduced: since whatever a man does in order to curb his desires, \ncomes under the head of fasting; and whatever a man does for the love of \nhis neighbor, comes under the head of alms-deeds; and whatever a man does \nfor the worship of God, comes under the head of prayer. And He mentions \nthese three specifically, as they hold the principal place, and are most \noften used by men in order to gain glory. In the second place He taught \nus that we must not place our  end in riches, when He said: \"Lay not up \nto yourselves treasures on earth\" (Mt. 6:19)."

        "question": "Whether certain definite counsels are fittingly proposed in the New Law?",
        "OB1": "It would seem that certain definite counsels are not fittingly \nproposed in the New Law. For counsels are given about that which is \nexpedient for an end, as we stated above, when treating of counsel (Question [14], Article [2]). But the same things are not expedient for all. Therefore certain \ndefinite counsels should not be proposed to all.",
        "OB2": "Further, counsels regard a greater good. But there are no \ndefinite degrees to the greater good. Therefore definite counsels should \nnot be given.",
        "OB3": "Further, counsels pertain to the life of perfection. But \nobedience pertains to the life of perfection. Therefore it was unfitting \nthat no counsel of obedience should be contained in the Gospel.",
        "OB4": "Further, many matters pertaining to the life of perfection are \nfound among the commandments, as, for instance, \"Love your enemies\" (Mt. 5:44), and those precepts which Our Lord gave His apostles (Mt. 10). \nTherefore the counsels are unfittingly given in the New Law: both because \nthey are not all mentioned; and because they are not distinguished from \nthe commandments.",
        "CON": "The counsels of a wise friend are of great use, \naccording to Prov. (27:9): \"Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and \nthe good counsels of a friend rejoice the soul.\" But  Christ is our \nwisest and greatest friend. Therefore His counsels are supremely useful \nand becoming.",
        "ANS": "The difference between a counsel and a commandment is \nthat a commandment implies obligation, whereas a counsel is left to the \noption of the one to whom it is given. Consequently in the New Law, which \nis the law of liberty, counsels are added to the commandments, and not in \nthe Old Law, which is the law of bondage. We must therefore understand \nthe commandments of the New Law to have been given about matters that are \nnecessary to gain the end of eternal bliss, to which end the New Law \nbrings us forthwith: but that the counsels are about matters that render \nthe gaining of this end more assured and expeditious.\nNow man is placed between the things of this world, and spiritual goods \nwherein eternal happiness consists: so that the more he cleaves to the \none, the more he withdraws from the other, and conversely. Wherefore he \nthat cleaves wholly to the things of this world, so as to make them his \nend, and to look upon them as the reason and rule of all he does, falls \naway altogether from spiritual goods. Hence this disorder is removed by \nthe commandments. Nevertheless, for man to gain the end aforesaid, he \ndoes not need to renounce the things of the world altogether: since he \ncan, while using the things of this world, attain to eternal happiness, \nprovided he does not place his end in them: but he will attain more \nspeedily thereto by giving up the goods of this world entirely: wherefore \nthe evangelical counsels are given for this purpose.\nNow the goods of this world which come into use in human life, consist \nin three things: viz. in external wealth pertaining to the \"concupiscence \nof the eyes\"; carnal pleasures pertaining to the \"concupiscence of the \nflesh\"; and honors, which pertain to the \"pride of life,\" according to 1 \nJn. 2:16: and it is in renouncing these altogether, as far as possible, \nthat the evangelical counsels consist. Moreover, every form of the \nreligious life that professes the state of perfection is based on these \nthree: since riches are renounced by poverty; carnal pleasures by \nperpetual chastity; and the pride of life by the bondage of obedience.\nNow if a man observe these absolutely, this is in accordance with the \ncounsels as they stand. But if a man observe any one of them in a \nparticular case, this is taking that counsel in a restricted sense, \nnamely, as applying to that particular case. For instance, when anyone \ngives an alms to a poor man, not being bound so to do, he follows the \ncounsels in that particular case. In like manner, when a man for some \nfixed time refrains from carnal pleasures that he may give himself to \nprayer, he follows the counsel for that particular time. And again, when \na man follows not his will as to some deed which he might do lawfully, he \nfollows the counsel in that particular case: for instance, if he do good \nto his enemies when he is not bound to, or if he forgive an injury of \nwhich he might justly seek to be avenged. In this way, too, all \nparticular counsels may be reduced to these three general and  perfect \ncounsels.",
        "RP1": "The aforesaid counsels, considered in themselves, are \nexpedient to all; but owing to some people being ill-disposed, it happens \nthat some of them are inexpedient, because their disposition is not \ninclined to such things. Hence Our Lord, in proposing the evangelical \ncounsels, always makes mention of man's fitness for observing the \ncounsels. For in giving the counsel of perpetual poverty (Mt. 19:21), He \nbegins with the words: \"If thou wilt be perfect,\" and then He adds: \"Go, \nsell all [Vulg.: 'what'] thou hast.\" In like manner when He gave the \ncounsel of perpetual chastity, saying (Mt. 19:12): \"There are eunuchs who \nhave made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven,\" He adds \nstraightway: \"He that can take, let him take it.\" And again, the Apostle \n(1 Cor. 7:35), after giving the counsel of virginity, says: \"And this I \nspeak for your profit; not to cast a snare upon you.\"",
        "RP2": "The greater goods are not definitely fixed in the \nindividual; but those which are simply and absolutely the greater good in \ngeneral are fixed: and to these all the above particular goods may be \nreduced, as stated above.",
        "RP3": "Even the counsel of obedience is understood to have been \ngiven by Our Lord in the words: \"And [let him] follow Me.\" For we follow \nHim not only by imitating His works, but also by obeying His \ncommandments, according to Jn. 10:27: \"My sheep hear My voice . . . and \nthey follow Me.\"",
        "RP4": "Those things which Our Lord prescribed about the true love \nof our enemies, and other similar sayings (Mt. 5; Lk. 6), may be referred \nto the preparation of the mind, and then they are necessary for \nsalvation; for instance, that man be prepared to do good to his enemies, \nand other similar actions, when there is need. Hence these things are \nplaced among the precepts. But that anyone should actually and promptly \nbehave thus towards an enemy when there is no special need, is to be \nreferred to the particular counsels, as stated above. As to those matters \nwhich are set down in Mt. 10 and Lk. 9 and 10, they were either \ndisciplinary commands for that particular time, or concessions, as stated \nabove (Article [2], ad 3). Hence they are not set down among the counsels."
